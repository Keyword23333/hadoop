80078 when we founded the business in 2002 we were looking to accomplish a couple of things one criterion was to be in a business that we felt was of benefit to the communities we wanted to serve and to be in a business that would prosper in both the good and bad business cycles that are inevitable
80079 we are having enormous success in what is now being termed a recession because our business clients are being more selective in their hiring and weeding out processes with the job market tightening and more people seeking jobs employers are taking advantage of the opportunity to weed out the drug users and hire new clean employees as for the use of illicit drugs by youth in our society nothing has slowed down the flow those two elements have allowed dtc and our associates to prosper in both positive and negative economic cycles which make us an ideal growth business

80114 i saw it necessary to develop a new system allowing any business owner who uses direct response copy in their online or offline marketing the possibility to legally and ethically
80115 roughly half of all new pools built in florida were built for new home construction
80116 so when home construction gets hit the pool builders feel it just as bad if not harder
80117 the last two years have been tough but weve done better than most our renovations and chemical business is up and our residential and commercial pool business is holding strong thanks mostly to referrals
80118 a few years ago we were building more than 600 pools per year in 2005 we made the decision to cut back to a more manageable 200 to 300 pools a year and focus more on commercial and renovations fortunately for us that was about six months before the downturn really started to hit so while other pool builders were scrambling we renovated and expanded our showroom with new displays and materials
80119 considering whats been happening to some of our peers and competitors were pretty darn happy at 4200 pools and counting id say weve become something of a mainstay in central florida
80120 i saw that years ago when i made blue nite lounge in a cabin in louisiana i like the sound of those recordings although some of them were recorded on cassette tape fully recorded records with the kitchen sink still have their place and the truth is i wouldnt mind doing another one but until the right budget comes along and the right interest the demo series will be just fine i hope people like the feel i dont know how many records ill put in this series but i hope at least one more who knows
80121 i started the song junkyard junky around 25 years ago and played with it off and on until i was ready to make another new record and i said i really need to include that song because its so much me and its gettin late in the game and so i sat down and finished it
80122 id already had quite a few demos that carson whitsett and jonnie barnett and i had come up with that i liked so that left a place for some more new songs bobby emmons and i wrote a new song called way back bucky lindsey bert colwell and i wrote a tune called back to the beach right before we cut and i recorded both of those with bucky on bass bert on guitar bobby on keyboards and jack bruno on drums we cut a total of four new tracks and i had some good tracks on demo including you must know written with arthur sloatman and recorded with a full band and the last song on the album forever changed written with carson and bucky
80123 people ask me all the time about those old muscle shoals demos i called for a copy of all of them from emi a few years back they sent them i heard them and i just didnt think they were good enough to release they were good for one thing and that was to impress the artist they were pitched to this they did very well i guess they would be interesting to somebody i dont know but i do know that these new demos are what im writing now and i live on that not on what i did 40 years ago
80124 im really enjoying playing live gigs with bobby emmons he is so clever and smooth we have a history we wrote nobodys fool together many years ago and other songs that i still like both of us being in nashville makes it easy to get together and write now and with carson whitsett gone i was needing a keyboard friend bobby stepped right in
80125 most of the patients about 55 in our review chose to replace both of their implants
80126 and we uncovered a few other interesting outcomes almost 60 of re implantation patients chose silicone gel implants instead of saline and slightly over half of these women chose to have a larger implant placed this suggests that following implant deflation many women take a step back and reconsider their original implant decisions
80127 in addition to focusing on implant choices we also examined the number of women who chose to have additional procedures performed during their re implantation and what types of procedures were performed
80128 we found that breast lift facial procedures and liposuction were the 3 most common types of surgery performed during a re implantation procedure we also discovered that almost one third of the women we saw for re implantation returned to our practice yet again for additional procedures within the study period
80129 the new website is user friendly and offers a more professional look which will enrich our visitors experience as they explore the technology products and services we offer we believe theyll find the information they need more quickly and easily

80131 it does a much better job of demonstrating the breadth of front and back office solutions that we offer
80132 i realized that through my own publishing experience i had begun to build a valuable database of publishing contacts for gay and lesbian authors
80133 it was then i began to think about providing other gay authors who were looking to go
80134 gay authors may have access to fewer traditional routes to publish their writing and rainbowauthors com provides another format for these important voices to be heard
80135 ever since the dutch painters and botanic illustrators exhibited portraits of exotic flowers in the 17th and 18th centuries we have desired these lasting images of natural beauty
80136 and every now and then designers reinterpret them in new and unexpected ways then we fall in love with floral design all over again
80137 today retro florals are in style and graphic contemporary florals are all the rage
80138 at the same time were seeing traditional botanic patterns and jacobean florals rendered in fresh new colors vibrant color gives classic design a new dimension and brings it into the 21st century

80165 were one player stronger and that one player is unfortunately going to take playing time away from an outfielder but again the impact on the 25 man roster is obviously important and that was the biggest plus

80172 we have 25 pre registered bidders already and are planning on accepting only 25 more for a total of 50
80173 since this is our first auction it will be hard to make any accurate projections as to what the winning bid will be
80174 however based on gut instinct and feedback received from clients i believe 70 of the inventory will go in the mid 2 cpm range 20 will go in the upper 1 cpm range and 10 you will be able to steal for the minimum bid really though your guess is as good as mine we will let the clients control the marketplace that is what an auction is all about

80180 the olympics have always served as a backdrop for whatever is going on in the world at that time
80181 the olympics are a mirror nazism racism extremism communism the cold war have all had starring roles depending on the olympics but what makes this olympics more attractive than ever for controversy is the ever growing stage its on tv all around the world
80182 for many such as protesters terrorists even the host country its a potent platform to get your message out to the entire world at the same time there are few events that match that type of world stage
80183 not that i wanted to whup the white man or get whupped by the white man because i saw what happened to my father i wanted to be equal to the man doing the whupping give me equality
80184 the thought process was of power or strength i didnt know how to do it except just hold my hands up like in church praise god with your hands up in church with your head bowed i thought it would be a good thing for me to do
80185 it was awful i mean we were warned it could be a possibility but you always held out hope that things would not go down that road
80186 when you have to put that aside for political things that you have no control over its really hard
80187 i think as long as it is in a positive noncontroversial manner theres so much personally as an athlete i can do to help so many causes as much as i love this sport i also love a lot of other things humanity being one of them
80188 so when i talk about darfur theres nothing controversial in wanting to save human lives
80189 im one that believes that the olympic games shouldnt be a platform for any political agenda from any country
80190 its something that im aware of as an issue but they shouldnt be using the olympic games as a platform it doesnt mean that im not sympathetic i just dont think its appropriate
80191 going back if you look at the times politics were used at the olympics like in berlin and the boycotts in 80 and 84 it hurts the athletes more than it hurts anybody else
80192 its widely recognised that when people get information overload they switch off and reject any advice theyre given people need space to calculate their financial commitments assess their priorities and come to their own conclusions
80193 its all very well lenders issuing reports about the saving patterns of consumers and urging them to take out some form of payment protection but if their premiums are sky high these products will be out of the reach of many people more reports confirming what we already know and then offering an unaffordable solution is not helping
80194 everyone wants to sell their products but i care more about people who are vulnerable who do not have huge salaries or savings to fall back on and are more likely to suffer financially this is why my products are cheaper so those who need them most can afford them
80195 im pretty sure it will cut playing time so ill just do whats asked of me
80196 i dont care what where or whenever but ill just do whats asked of me thats it make the best of it we have a good team here just help when i can help thats all i can do

80218 though serious football fans love this pool it has also proven to attract casual fans people who enjoy football games but are simply turned off by the amount of work and time required to participate in other types of pools
80219 employees with normal test levels and no history of medical events are often assumed to be healthy and low risk

80226 homeowners are attracted to electric heat because its quick and easy
80227 if you look at the big picture the cost of electricity is no longer so cost prohibitive when compared to the current cost of heating oil or gas
80228 houseneeds sales on electric units are up 25 from last year at this time
80229 customers want to know how much they can save and its really hard to tell
80230 if everybody goes electric then the demand will most likely cause utility prices to rise theres no true measure of what the savings can or will be long term
80231 i can afford to put an electric eco heater on the wall in each room even if i only turn them on during the cold spells that might get me through the winter with only 1 or 2 refills on my tank and that might just might make all the difference

80285 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
80286 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
80287 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
80288 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
80289 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
80290 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
80291 our proven ability to screen job applicants for tax credit eligibility via phone and web and automatically populate the necessary paperwork for new hires will dramatically improve our clients results with tax credits through our new tax credit processing center and compliance management solution we are now able to further improve client results and offer an end to end single vendor solution
80292 we could have a few people a sampling of the community and talk to some of the rank and file people about some of the issues that bother us because i presume they bother other people as well
80293 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
80294 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
80295 social technologies used its knowledgebase to identify the trends and issues most relevant to guys lives

80302 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
80303 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
80304 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
80305 the sale of this item may be subject to regulation by the u s food and drug administration and state and local regulatory agencies if so do not bid on this item unless you are an authorized purchaser if the item is subject to fda regulation i will verify your status as an authorized purchaser of this item before shipping of the item
80306 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
80307 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
80308 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
80309 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
80310 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
80311 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
80312 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
80313 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
80314 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
80315 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
80316 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
80317 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
80318 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
80319 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
80320 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
80321 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
80322 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
80323 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
80324 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
80325 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
80326 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
80327 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
80328 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
80329 i cannot deliver the state but i have already been trying to be helpful to senator obama and i will continue to do that
80330 i cant even deliver ohio for myself it takes a lot of people to help a candidate win a state ill try to do my part certainly
80331 ive said and i deeply believe that ohio race will be very close very competitive thats the nature of ohio
80332 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
80333 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
80334 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
80335 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
80336 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
80337 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
80338 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
80339 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
80340 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
80341 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
80342 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
80343 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
80344 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
80345 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
80346 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
80347 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
80348 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
80349 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
80350 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
80351 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
80352 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
80353 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
80354 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
80355 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
80356 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
80357 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
80358 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
80359 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
80360 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
80361 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

80378 its something that im definitely going to reflect on now and then when im done
80379 i continue to stay healthy and im surrounded by good talent and good things are going to come from that so as long as i can stay healthy and these guys do their job around me were going to do some special things here in montreal
80380 it was a huge play obviously to be able to start fast but to my recollection the last three games i think weve started fast in the third quarter
80381 i just wanted them to forget about the first half and move on like it didnt happen the game was 0 0 and just go play and they handled it very well and they finished the game
80382 richie did what he can do we had too many penalties i dont know what the total was but weve been doing good the last time we lost the penalty ratio was the first game against montreal and the rest of the games weve been plus
80383 any game you can come in and go 5 for 5 its definitely a good feeling especially two of them being 50 and 51

80392 i think he as a player should have kept his comments to himself you cant deny the mans talent but his attitude was a problem
80393 im very disappointed he has been my favorite player since he came to the sox i liked him even when he was on the indians
80394 i mean yeah hes having the worst season he has had his whole career but come time for post season hes going to be the best player in the league
80395 its going to be weird going to fenway without him there
80396 i thought i was going to die when nomar garciaperra was traded but the red sox lived whatever is good for the team is what we should do
80397 when you think even high school level and college level people are dying to be on the field i think he isnt hungry any more
80398 ill be sorry to see him go but i think its the best for the team
80399 i dont like the trade hes a future hall of famer and we have to put up with the crap sometimes

80402 privacy is respected and guaranteed in china chinas security measures in hotels and other public places are not beyond the internationally generally used measures
80403 the has put in place a system to spy on and gather information about every guest at hotels where olympic visitors are staying
80404 this means journalists athletes families and other visitors will be subjected to invasive intelligence gathering by the
80405 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
80406 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else

80409 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
80410 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
80411 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
80412 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
80413 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
80414 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

80433 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
80434 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
80435 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
80436 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
80437 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
80438 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
80439 is it valid to go after barack obama on inexperience being a bit glib perhaps even a bit arrogant for doing the european tour absolutely but you just sound dopey when you put paris hilton in an ad
80440 to come up with a more affirmative narrative for his candidacy why is he running what does he stand for before going after barack obama
80441 mccain has lost the free media contest over the past couple of weeks hes desperate to make the news and controversial attacks are more newsworthy than boilerplate positive ads
80442 the ad is meant to acknowledge reality that he is huge that he is a celebrity
80443 it wasnt meant to be insulting one of the things we learned from hillary clinton running against obama is that railing against his celebrity whining about his celebrity doesnt work
80444 to inject britney spears and paris hilton into the debate is beneath what america deserves
80445 it was a way for them to get attention for yet another inaccurate misleading negative attack people are caught up with the gimmick
80446 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
80447 every time they put up a negative ad were going to respond with the force of truth
80448 most voters wont see the parallels between a presidential candidate and two party girls so a legitimate point about inexperience gets lost in the appearance of name calling
80449 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
80450 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
80451 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
80452 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
80453 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
80454 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
80455 for these reasons arguably the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
80456 i think irregular warfare is very important particularly in contrast to preparing solely for conventional warfighting but it shouldnt be our only focus
80457 we ought to be training our forces and procuring our weapons systems to reflect the reality
80458 the chiefs were provided an opportunity to review the document by the secretary

80465 after taking a few different exams and mris this morning the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
80466 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal
80467 it really hurts me to say that i have to miss the olympics
80468 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire

80482 what is that when we think up laws so it is easier for business and they ignore them
80483 on immediate measures for the elimination of administrative barriers to business activity
80484 if its budget we have ways of reducing income theres no use denying it
80485 small business is a method for the renewal of our country

80487 now that were hitting on the back end of the year im going to focus on the hooters tour as much as i can up until q school maybe sprinkle in a few nationwide qualifiers
80488 ill probably play six seven more tournaments here and then get ready for first stage of pga tour qualifying
80489 its hooters tour a good tour to play because the purses are 200 000 each week four rounds so youre simulating your preparation for q school and the pga tour and thats what im looking for

80530 dr ammon wexler hello from don reed from your old haunts silicon valley
80531 but i now apologize for doubting you could do this on the web your millionaire mind power program is the real thing i love it and now have four of my key people taking the program

80590 and we have no reports of missing or overdue people
80591 we arent 100 per cent certain but we are crossing our fingers
80592 setting limits on what one can purchase in a specific market there are also restrictions on how many a household can buy or how much can be put on a credit card
80593 the plaintiffs exposure and inhalation ingestion or absorption of the asbestos fibers was completely foreseeable and could or should have been anticipated by the defendants
80594 the defendants included asbestos in their products even when adequate substitutes were available and failed to provide any or adequate instructions concerning the safe methods of working with and around asbestos
80595 the defendants failed to require and advise employees of hygiene practices designed to reduce or prevent carrying asbestos fibers home
80596 this is low grade asbestos material thats used throughout the mill
80597 all the areas have this kind of cladding as far as im concerned they dont need to be concerned
80598 a lot of the guys do have concerns over the safety of the mill although i think it would be inaccurate to say the mill is an unsafe site
80599 the nomination took a couple days to sink in to tell the truth
80600 now that i think about it its our biggest honor as filmmakers by a long shot
80601 if the political pressure to prosecute graces executives to the full extent of the law persists it will be due in part to this deeply moving film
80602 it increases the probability that there will be a pursuit of justice
80603 whether or not people are convicted is really up to the court system but my hope is that the movie had some role in building public understanding i love the idea that the movie could have that kind of impact but im trying to be realistic about it i do believe that this type of media can raise public awareness
80604 in doing this and other work they found there were places that we believed to be remediated in late 1980s that were not remediated for asbestos
80605 there is a perception of asbestos and health risks we dont want to take any possibility of putting anyone at risk and want to protect students and staff
80606 we will remediate the building properly and have work complete for 2009 2010
80607 the basement and front desk areas air supply vent will be wiped down and cleaned using special vacuums after recent testing showed asbestos particles in the air
80608 anything that comes to the citys attention we are going to take any step necessary to remediate it
80609 im satisfied its getting done but its the way we had to go about it
80610 were not demanding we just want to work in an environment that is safe
80611 current surgical and chemotherapy treatments of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma are unsatisfactory and have not been shown to significantly prolong survival in this study we will investigate whether a combination of chemotherapy and radiation targeted directly at the lungs lining can improve outcomes while avoiding surgery
80612 the trial is also significant because our center is the only one nationwide that is offering this experimental therapy to treat pleural mesothelioma
80613 patients enrolled in the study will receive several rounds of targeted chemotherapy using the drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin via surgically implanted catheters some patients will be randomly selected to receive additional systemic intravenous chemotherapy using the drugs cisplatin and pemetrexed
80614 on site exposures to asbestos fibers when on site soils and asbestos containing material are disturbed are a public health hazard to area residents
80615 prior to enacting the planned containment and stabilization work it was necessary to bring workers and machinery onsite to clear overgrown vegetation repair fencing and begin building access roads
80616 of the 49 samples collected from the identified areas 10 were found to be positive for asbestos content
80617 i think theyre trying to gloss over and cover up the information
80618 theyve tested that one area and found asbestos and cleaned it thats what they should have told parents
80619 we will make a determination as soon as we know how bad it is
80620 the scene has been turned over to the property management company and insurance company

80624 we never invested in quality passenger rail travel like other countries
80625 its almost impossible that the american network could ever be able to mirror those ultra efficient models around the world
80626 if we want to have a good train system weve got to get rid of the government monopoly on rail transport
80627 we believe the largest single reason is that people want to avoid the higher cost of driving their own vehicle
80628 these trains can be very full and because the seats are unreserved there can be times when passengers have to stand

80641 trucks weighing over 80 000 pounds pay only about half of their highway cost responsibility longer and heavier trucks unless accompanied by sharp increases in taxes would exacerbate this inequity and based on a u s department of transportation study divert between 100 and 225 million tons of freight annually from rail to highways
80642 it was clear that people werent buying a prius to save money on gas gas was selling close to inflation adjusted all time lows
80643 they were buying them to make a statement about the environment
80644 when something is destroyed you dont necessarily rebuild the same thing that you had you might use updated technology you might do things more efficiently it bumps you up
80645 using this logic the federal government should spur greater growth and technological development by regularly and frequently bulldozing random homes and businesses across the country
80646 if youre a carpenter a trash remover a physician you may be made better off but the things that those producers would have otherwise produced are not going to be produced
80647 over any reasonably relevant period of time society is not made wealthier by destroying resources

80655 we cant send our kids out into a world where they are not prepared
80656 as a university we do not award as many firsts and 2 1s as other comparable institutions so there is an understandable desire to increase the proportion of such awards
80657 please bear this in mind when setting your second and final year assessments especially the latter
80658 we have never received any external examiner criticism that our standards are too low so there should be quite a lot of leeway available to us all when assessments are set
80659 please do not complain when all the bsc hons mathematics students gain first class awards next summer now that really would increase our student satisfaction

80670 im very happy to announce that weve gotten an ice sample
80671 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
80672 we got a little bit of ice mixed in with this sample
80673 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
80674 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
80675 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
80676 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
80677 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
80678 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
80679 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
80680 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
80681 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
80682 they are going have to be answered and they know this
80683 the first i heard about anything regarding the snow team was your investigation
80684 the opportunity was there to misuse overtime pay but ive seen no evidence anybody did take advantage
80685 you cant justify somebody working that straight and be efficient
80686 should i buy that the only way to keep pena boulevard open is to pay people 100k a year or the equivalent to run a snow plow
80687 i dont want to make any statements here until i see the reports but my gut feeling is with you and it does bother me

80690 we are now in the final push to get the first preview release of the javafx sdk out the door for the end of the month im excited by what weve put together but also exhausted
80691 since javaone 2007 weve built from scratch a compiler for a new language with many non trivial features a gui runtime with a new graphics and animation stack new netbeans plugins with code completion utilities for graphic designers a new kind of javadocs rewritten from the ground up plus docs samples and demos and thats not even counting the many improvements that are going into java se 6 update 10
80692 the quicker sun can go open fully open source with their javafx stack start developing it in the open letting people use nightly builds and even collaborating in the open the better positioned theyll be to make up for any lateness
80693 one of the problems with flash is people only think of it as being used to do public web sites
80694 its a misconception a significant percentage of flash applications people are making now are enterprise applications behind the corporate firewall
80695 rather than pulling out the back end and starting from scratch they just replaced the ui
80696 no good development tools to develop flash applications in a decent environment
80697 in the long run enterprises are going to have to spruce up their internal web sites

80709 were always looking to see what we can do to enhance our business strategically financially and operationally
80710 that is always on the table and were constantly reviewing our options yes
80711 this is the one that we have elected to go forward and study in greater detail
80712 fundamentally what marathons board is looking at here is we are convinced the market isnt seeing the full value here so to maximize the value for shareholders we will consider splitting up
80713 we think the large integrated players are being rated lower than the large pure upstream players
80714 heretofore marathons value has been depressed by the companys group leading refining leverage which has hampered the companys ability to translate higher oil and natural gas prices into earnings growth particularly relative to peers
80715 ultimately it would probably show itself to be a strong player
80716 you trust the data but you know its not perfect
80717 we still have a system thats very much geared to the older industrial sectors of the economy
80718 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women
80719 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
80720 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
80721 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
80722 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
80723 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
80724 the power to bargain for higher wages a power that we assume was dismantled may not be so feeble
80725 real wages adjusted for inflation are falling and there is no sign at all of any change in direction
80726 i am concerned that at some point they will have to be accommodated because they cant afford the rising costs of gasoline food utilities
80727 and they cant resort to automatic cost of living adjustments or union power theyll find some other way through their demands on the political process and through their expectations
80728 they tell us they want to do more domestic production
80729 they tell us they need to drill offshore they tell us that they can find oil on the mainland and what do they do with their profits they buy back stock simply to increase their share price
80730 they had talked about growing production about 1 percent a year but im not sure theyre going to hit that this year
80731 we are demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders
80732 we all have the same initiatives the policies all come from washington d c and right now mortgage fraud is no 1

80774 its always awkward when the incumbent whose term is up is not very popular and the candidate running is trying to distance himself
80775 its a huge challenge to the party to figure out what to do
80776 i tell you he comes from a family that understands politics and that is whats called for here
80777 as far as his policies for whatever reason our president has definitely not stayed within the druthers of the majority of republicans
80778 hes served honorably and i think texans are going to remember that
80779 when i said those words four years ago none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring
80780 our energy policy is essentially nonexistent which looks like its been pretty good to houston
80781 but even those in the energy business here in houston will tell you its not sustainable over the long run
80782 is that your idea of a serious policy debate its intellectually bankrupt that agenda so our job is to make sure we resist getting pulled into that nonsense
80783 climate change is real and houston you cannot afford to get any hotter
80784 texas doesnt shy away from big challenges texas likes big
80785 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
80786 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
80787 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
80788 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails
80789 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
80790 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
80791 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
80792 it is im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and we dont theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
80793 what we are talking about here is substance and not style

80811 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
80812 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
80813 the scientific community is really going to run with this
80814 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
80815 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
80816 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
80817 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
80818 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
80819 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
80820 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window
80821 give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and i will move the earth

80825 they want you to run they want you to because then they know who you are if you run they must expect you have something to hide right
80826 you all look normal maybe a little dirty frayed around the edges perhaps but you can blend in you can slip back into the world and no one would notice as long as you dont advertise yourselves as anything other than equal to them
80827 theyll friggin hunt us down they know we are man theyll kill us
80828 how can they know who you are they dont have magic glasses to see what you are they arent running bloodtests on everyone they see dont give them the idea and they wont think twice about you
80829 man listen to you tell us not to hide and yer doin it yerself
80830 im not hiding from them my good man im hiding from people like you the ignorant of mind who unrightfully attempt to defy their own mental limitations by boasting some misguided uninformed theories on the natural order of things ive spent some time with the crazies and lets just say theyre view on the world isnt far off of yours
80831 i know i know that each one of these takes me that much closer to my death everytime i smoke its like im hammering down the nails to my coffin forever sealing myself off to be buried six feet under i know that they kill like the whole world knows but i choose to do it anyway to make a point
80832 and what point is that c that you can take it that everyone else is a pussy
80833 the point is that i know what they are and what they do yet i choose to partake anyway i defy common sense in doing it me a creation of science intended to think ahead to bring logic to a human equation where no true emotionless logic can be found makes the choice to do something that even the most basic of common sense tells one not to do painstakingly designed to rationalize things out beyond that of a normal human yet i ingest a cloud of smoke that i am assured will kill me
80834 exactly the logic is gone and do you know why
80835 because i choose to remove the logic i was made to be logical yet i defy that design my sole purpose in life is to rationalize so by defying that i defy basic laws of physics laws of nature i break basic rules because i choose to because i can damn it
80836 that damon oh predestined killer oh agent of death is choice

80849 it was inspired by i was looking through a clothing catalog amp saw a picture of a girl modeling this piece of clothing called a space dye vest and so i fell in love with her laughs for some strange reason amp so the minute i did that the minute i was just like obsessed w this person i was like why am i doing that amp i noticed that i was doing it a lot lately and i think the prime reason that i was doing that and this is what i figured out at the time was that i had just come out of a relationship where id gotten dumped basically and so i think the situation was that i wasnt finished giving all that i was ready to give so i was just like throwing it around you know just aiming it in different directions it was a total case of projection and this song is just trying to sort it out amp just kind of admitting that im just kind of lost so its kind of a dark song it was very cathartic though

80862 elisas mobile subscriptions grew by nearly 80 000 fuelled by our extensive 3g network and growing demand for mobile broadband the 3g market continues to enjoy dynamic growth and mobile broadband especially is gaining more popularity despite the continued fierce competition we believe in a more positive market development than previously predicted thus we increase our estimate that there will be up to 1 6 million people using 3g services in finland by the end of the year bundling of 3g handset and subscription has been a popular way for consumers to efficiently use new mobile services we believe that if legislation allowing 3g bundling will be made permanent the significant positive impact to the development of the finnish information society will continue elisas share of the 3g market continues to be about 50 per cent by the end of this year elisas 3g network will cover 250 locations and 85 per cent of the population and most of the 3g network will have a speed of 5mb s we continue our long term investments in the quality of service and customer satisfaction the use of our new billing and crm system is back to normal we have initiated several actions to improve customer service for example hiring more customer service employees these measures resulted in shorter customer service queuing time and thus improved customer satisfaction customer churn decreased and we gained almost 80 000 more mobile subscriptions revenue and ebitda developed as expected during the second quarter but temporary expenses increased we also made decisions on additional measurers in our savings programs and the outlook is reiterated we are determined to continue developing one elisa and to improve our profitability according to our strategy

80882 they tell us they want to do more domestic production
80883 they tell us they need to drill offshore they tell us that they can find oil on the mainland and what do they do with their profits they buy back stock simply to increase their share price
80884 they had talked about growing production about 1 percent a year but im not sure theyre going to hit that this year
80885 we are demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders
80886 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
80887 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
80888 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
80889 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails
80890 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
80891 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
80892 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
80893 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
80894 when he did it the first time yesterday we let it pass when he did it again later specifically linking us to it we decided to respond
80895 it is im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and we dont theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
80896 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
80897 campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have raised
80898 all theyre doing is churning out the same stuff they do every four years all you have to do is change the name
80899 so when you hear my opponent say hes too risky what theyre really saying is we know we dont have any good ideas but you should be worried about him
80900 it seems to me at this point it would be naive of the obama campaign not to anticipate efforts to tear at obamas character the way bush tore away at john kerrys character four years ago so if a fellow can rationally expect a swift boat full of funny racial angles racing at him he would only be sane to try to deflect that
80901 my mom loves it i still think its more likely that hell go in another direction i dont spend a lot of time thinking about it
80902 he is really troubled he just doesnt have a record of accomplishment
80903 my sense is as governor ive gotten a lot of stuff done
80904 weve reformed mental health we have the biggest higher education bond program weve expanded pre k youre not going to have a 1000 batting average but the way you get votes is you just push and you push im not afraid to do that
80905 i kind of had this feeling that everybody knew what they wanted to do but i didnt
80906 people want to know what your motivation is for me its my faith
80907 that was strengthened in my experience in honduras i just want to serve people i know it sounds like a simple clich
80908 hes not only a leader hes a jewish leader and they follow what he has to say
80909 a tell that they think the state really is in play
80910 when mccain switched on drilling a lot of people said there goes florida
80911 i think whites are spoilt for all the bad things they did to black people they ought to be a bit more grateful in fact they should count themselves lucky they were not shot on the day of liberation perhaps its not too late to hang a few whites at the local stadium just to remind them who is charge
80912 whites never stop complaining they whinge about crime they say the country is the most violent in the world well they can afford to say that for their information the violence has always been there its just that when they were in power all the crime and violence was taking place in black communities
80913 i want zuma to embark on a redistribution exercise i want him to distribute white women among the long suffering black chaps in south africa he must first choose which white woman he wants he can even have two that done he must then distribute to his loyal supporters and if there is a surplus he should distribute to his supporters in tiny neighbouring states

80920 uly 31 2008 neocon flap highlights jewish divide by daniel luban and jim lobe a mushrooming media controversy pitting neoconservatives against a prominent jewish american political commentator could mark a new stage in the growing battle over who speaks for the us jewish community on foreign policy issues particularly regarding the middle east time columnist joe kleins accusations that jewish neoconservatives who played a particularly visible role in the drive to war in iraq and have since pushed for military confrontation in iran sacrificed us lives and money to make the world safe for israel have spurred angry charges of anti semitism and personal attacks from critics at such neoconservative strongholds as the weekly standard national review and commentary but the fierceness of the controversy surrounding klein generally considered a political centrist highlights the growing antagonism between neoconservative hardliners and prominent us jews whose more moderate views are aligned more closely with those of the foreign policy establishment

80939 it was nice to get back to someone this close to the area
80940 matt and i have had a knack for promoting shows this is the big show
80941 i have kids its just a good gut check things could be a lot worse it makes me realize how fortunate i am
80942 thats the main reason why i keep doing it its for a great cause
80943 you usually see it in the elderly or older adults
80944 she called and asked me if i was interested in filling out an application for rock for life
80945 we have to authorize and approve everything that is spent
80946 i was wondering what was going to happen with the baby waiting to see if he moved
80947 he comes in and says theres no easy way to tell you this but your son maybe has some kind of heart defect
80948 they werent sure if it was a hole in his heart or what but there was blood and fluid all around his heart
80949 i was actually showing what was wrong with the baby because he couldnt show it
80950 but the doctor told him youre going in that room because your baby is going to have a 25 percent chance of making it out of that room alive he said it didnt look good and he wasnt going to sugar coat it for us
80951 but i said no my baby will be fine i felt it
80952 i knew as soon as they cut him out that he was going to make it
80953 i stayed at allegheny general and they said they would call when the surgery was over
80954 it seemed like eternity but they called and said he was out of surgery that he was doing better
80955 and from there it was just a matter of him getting bigger and stronger
80956 hes five months old and he should be doing more than hes doing
80957 i dont ever want to think hes perfect because i dont know whats going to happen right now hes doing well
80958 were just going day by day we never know whats going to happen or whats going to come our way
80959 i was shocked to see what it looked like myself
80960 obviously you hate to jump to tommy john right off the bat
80961 but i think its to the point where its kind of foolish to try to rehab for five months and try to let it heal that way i think the damage is beyond trying to heal itself
80962 if he has surgery im going to obviously do all i can to try to come back next year and help this team win
80963 you know what those things will take care of themselves
80964 i want to come back and be strong next year and whatever happens happens
80965 the surgeries today are pretty good as far as coming back at 100 percent
80966 im not really concerned with if i have it am i going to be 100 percent after the surgery
80967 its hard to sit here and not play when you feel fine
80968 but at the same time if i go back behind home plate and catch a foul tip in the mask and im not completely healed its going to make my concussion a lot worse
80969 i just need time to rest just make sure be overly cautious i think monday will be a week i think thats what youre trying to shoot for
80970 hes gone through heck this year didnt he win 11 games two years in a row

80977 substance abuse is particularly devastating when it afflicts young people because they are the communitys future
80978 i didnt know what an addict was much less that i was one
80979 i was a functional addict i received good grades in school and maintained two jobs but it got to the point where i was suicidal thats when i approached my parents and they brought me to memorial hermanns center
80980 when you remember that 84 000 drug abusers and 99 000 alcohol abusers arent getting the treatment they need 68 beds for teens wont go a long way
80981 the real problem is that the number of beds funded by the federal and state government dont begin to meet the need
80982 the key to it is getting the cards in peoples hands and then using them if they do theyre going to save money
80983 if we can find a way to save money thats great but any time i hear the word free i always look for the fine print at the bottom of the page
80984 i dont know want to know about this ive read enough

80993 wall street firms are scrutinizing their extension of credit particularly to the gaming industry where the sentiment is pretty weak
80994 this decision was precipitated by an unexpected and in our opinion unwarranted and unjustified act by our syndicate of banks which deprived us of the cash we needed to sustain and to continue those operations
80995 we have a lot of closings that are supposed to occur
80996 if people miss closing dates they can lose their loans the ones today could be in jeopardy

80998 the debt capital market which is really our core business segment is going through a very very difficult time

81008 it seens incresingly true that the hole imaginative life of the man tends to reconstitute simbolically by the most similar situations and representations that initial paradisaical state and the specially surmount the horrably traumatism of birth by which we are explused from the paradise passing abruptly from the ideally protective and enclosed environment to all the hard dangers of the frighfully real new world with the concomitant phenomena of asphyxiation of compression of blinding by the sudden outer light and of the brutal hashness of the reality world

81018 caerulein and the equiactive phyllocaerulein display a potent action on the gastrointestinal smooth muscle and gastric and pancreatic secretions side effects observed in volunteer patients with post operative intestinal atony were nausea vomiting facial flush mild tachycardia heart palpitations changes in blood pressure sweating abdominal discomfort and urge for defecation
81019 that the intense peripheral cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms observed in the early phase of sapo intoxication may be entirely ascribed to the known bioactive peptides occurring in large amounts in the frog material
81020 increase in physical strength enhanced resistance to hunger and thirst and more generally increase in the capacity to face stress situations may be explained by the presence of caerulein and sauvagine in the drug

81027 may increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier thus facilitating access to the brain not only of themselves but also of the other active peptides
81028 peptides that either enhance or inhibit binding of adenosine analogs to brain adenosine receptors proved to be present in extracts of the dried skin secretion
81029 preliminary animal studies by researchers at warner lambert have hinted that those receptors which are distributed throughout the brains of mammals could offer a target for treating depression stroke seizures and cognitive loss in ailments such as alzheimers disease

81149 following a detailed review of publishing operations it is proposed to restructure editorial distribution and certain field based newspaper sales functions
81150 it is anticipated that the proposed changes will deliver newspaper sales benefits and enable efficiencies in printing and distribution
81151 specifically it is proposed that both daily titles will be printed overnight in peterborough with editorial shift patterns and newsroom structures in both northampton and kettering being adjusted to accommodate adjusted file deadlines
81152 in distrubution it is proposed to adjust shift patterns to facilitate overnight distribution of both titles into retail
81153 prior to any implementation we will consult extensively on an individual and collective basis and we have commenced this process today with those individuals affected
81154 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
81155 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy

81188 pte cowton was a vibrant and much loved 25 year old soldier with a passion for the army and the parachute regiment
81189 he was a lynchpin in 9 platoon with his previous military experience and mature head cool outlook and indomitable spirit
81190 he was a very promising prospect indeed for the future despite his limited time of service at 2 para
81191 pte cowton was noted for being trustworthy dedicated and the consummate professional whose energy and enthusiasm shone above all else
81192 there was no fuss about the manner in which pte cowton conducted himself he was on the mark with everything quietly discerning and absolutely focussed
81193 he was bright and astute swift in body and mind learning quickly and applying himself without fault to his chosen vocation he was the model of modesty and humility
81194 his was the role of lead scout a role usually reserved for the best private soldier with considerable years and experience behind him
81195 he was the eyes and ears of the platoon the trigger man who kept his fellow paratroopers safe by his initiative and guile
81196 in this role he found himself at the front fighting through a taliban position giving the enemy cause to turn and run
81197 in their wake they had left the most cowardly of devices that initiated as he led his platoon on to dominating ground from where the enemy could be suppressed
81198 despite his determination and the best efforts of the medical team he died as a result of his wounds

81203 my officers maintained a high visibility presence around the old railway line and police community support officers were on patrol in the area throughout the day
81204 this means that a junction will now be built much earlier than had been thought

81206 i had no doubt that this was it but i then read the letter with a fine tooth comb i can see why theres an element of personal confusion there

81208 we contract private buses out in places like ormiston where there isnt a public bus company and i expect them to live up to their contracts

81213 we know the scientists keep telling us we only have until october this year to make an impact on saving the river by getting new water released into the river system immediately
81214 all the federal government has is a plan for a plan a plan that wont take effect until 2019 when its hoping that the state governments will have brought their water sharing plans into line with the sustainable cap
81215 that means we will have a lovely plan but the river will be dead
81216 by 2019 the coorong will be gone and so too may the communities along the lower river areas
81217 the reality is unless we can curb water use and put sustainable measures into place in the extremely near future we are going to be watching the river die
81218 a recent report predicted that the lower lakes would be irreparably damaged if they do not receive water by october
81219 that is less than two months away now and we have to allow time for water to travel from the point of release to the lakes

81224 particularly in the last 12 months weve had a major change in the operating environment
81225 in new south wales weve seen the last round of gaming taxes come in weve had the impact of smoking bans and of course in the last six months weve had higher interest rates and increasing petrol prices
81226 that has resulted in some financial stress for a lot of clubs particularly in new south wales
81227 those are the values which will not disappear because as weve seen in recent years there has been a major resurgence in our younger generation going to gallipolli and being out there on anzac day supporting our veterans
81228 thats something which we would want to preserve but its a matter of re positioning the rsl clubs to be applicable to that wider demographic
81229 because of rsls generally having to reinvent themselves there is a growing trend for families to go to rsl clubs

81235 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
81236 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
81237 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

81253 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
81254 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
81255 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

81275 the atrocious murder of four girls to satisfy his sexual desire leaves no room for leniency
81276 in japan the majority view is that capital punishment should be maintained so i feel no need to change what we have continued doing until now
81277 it wasnt just what university he came from he also had to have gone to good high and junior high schools and he had to be working for top ranked company he needed to be 15 centimeters taller than i am and be a good driver i didnt want anyone whose eating manners were bad they had to know a lot about wine and champagne but also be sensible drinkers and on top of all that he needed to have similar values and be a person i could respect or there was no way id marry him
81278 i guess i had a lot of things i wanted but i got married in the end so i have no worries now
81279 i guess it might have been because marriage put my mind at ease but my career is also progressing better
81280 i married had kids got a career and its all going really well people tell me i should have no worries in the world but for some reason i feel lonely every day
81281 i guess i dream of falling in love again to feel that thrill i realize i sound like a silly schoolgirl but perhaps im getting the feeling that my use by date as a woman is approaching
81282 when people get into their late 40s the number going through menopause increases dramatically menopause brings with it the impression that youre finished as a woman
81283 i have a really strong urge to confirm for myself one more time that im still a woman
81284 having been through those days there are parts of me that would find it relatively easy to plunge into an extramarital affair
81285 and i look at others around me and think the same about them
81286 honestly i really want to love my husband all over again but it doesnt look like i do anything for him anymore
81287 i dont want to reach my use by date for a woman like this and that was what i was thinking when i first met my boyfriend
81288 he has now said that he locked up his daughter for 24 years and that he alone fathered her seven children and that he locked them up in the cellar
81289 the family lived upstairs he had children with his own daughter who lived downstairs
81290 he did not want to give any details to officers who investigated it
81291 there are a number of rooms everything is very very narrow and the victim herself the mother of these children told us that this was continually enlarged over the years
81292 behind the shelf was a door made of reinforced concrete secured electronically and running on steel rails
81293 it was a prison which he installed with skill and energy
81294 the lives of the three children in the cellar is in no way comparable with the lives of their three siblings
81295 since the day they were born they have never seen the light of day they never had any doctor to care for them when they were sick
81296 they learned to speak from their mother in isolation they were pale and experienced having to be nearby during the ordeal their mother was put through
81297 the entire nation must ask itself just what is fundamentally going wrong
81298 helping right wrongs and have fun at the same time

81300 if we only make standard fare we cannot beat other studios there were already adult videos with lolitas or themes of incest so we wanted to make something new a relationship between wife and an old father in law has enough twist to create an atmosphere of mystery and captivate viewers hearts
81301 i think that as a subject there is this something that only an older generation has and the young people do not possess it is because they lived that much more we should respect them and learn from them
81302 its easier for them to relate to older men and daughters in law series so they tend to watch adult videos with older people in them
81303 people of my age generally have shame so they are very hesitant to show their private parts
81304 but i am proud of myself doing something they cannot
81305 that doesnt mean that i can tell them about my old age pensioner job

81308 however much it lacked in taste i found it gave me freedom to roam at pleasure
81309 i cannot afford to dress to please their taste i could not positively enjoy a moments happiness with a long skirt to confine me to the wagon
81310 nearly everyone tried to discourage me from attempting it but i believed i should succeed and now here i am and feel that i would not have missed this glorious sight for anything at all

81312 the difference between eastern and western europe for gay people is sometimes a really depressing experience
81313 young polish people travel a lot and they go to places like spain where gays can get married and they are no different under the law than other people
81314 and they come back home and ask why cant it be like that here
81315 poles are still believers unlike in many other countries which makes conservative forces here stronger
81316 there is no sexual education in schools because of the church so young people know little about homosexuality besides what they hear on sunday or on the street

81320 theres almost twice as much turbulence experienced in the winter months than in summer over greenland
81321 the pacific route between australia and the us is another hotspot for turbulence that occurs almost all year round
81322 the us is terrible in the northern summertime because of storms
81323 id always try to fly in the mornings storms predominately occur in the afternoons in the us
81324 if we knew where and when turbulence would occur wed be out of work
81325 nevertheless we can make some general statements based on climatologies of aircraft encounters
81326 most commercial aircraft have on board weather radars so they typically avoid the main parts of the thunderstorm however turbulence can occur in regions where the radar is not seeing much but where there is visible cloud
81327 turbulence can also occur in the clear air on the sides and above rising thunderstorms and this seems to be a source of some very severe encounters especially at night when the pilot does not have any visual clues
81328 about a dozen in flight turbulence injuries are reported in australia each year to the atsb and many more go unreported
81329 some of these injuries are serious and have resulted in broken bones and head injuries
81330 in 2000 a boeing 747 encountered clear air turbulence en route from sydney to osaka japan
81331 when the turbulence struck the seat belt sign was not illuminated and people were moving about the cabin
81332 during the turbulence two passengers sustained broken ankles both of those passengers had been out of their seats during the turbulence

81337 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
81338 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
81339 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
81340 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

81351 i got exactly what i wanted out of the deal the true facts of the situation
81352 i feel a lot better knowing that under oath nelson said that during dallas nba finals games in 2006 that he was meeting with golden states gm and helping the warriors work on their draft plans
81353 unfortunately according to the arbitrator because i held back about 25 000 in consulting payments as i tried to understand the situation i am obligated to pay him the deferred money he was to be paid basically i pay him the exact same amount i would have paid him had this not happened
81354 i can live with that it was all worth the hassle to find out what really happened
81355 not so much a legal defeat for cuban as it was an old fashioned ass whuppin
81356 its a good day im relieved it ended the way it did i didnt think i would lose and i didnt think he would win but you just never know when you go to court
81357 it was kind of a silly case its like a pimple on his behind for cuban but 6 plus million is a big number for me i dont feel like ive won the lottery because ive already earned that money but its good to know im going to get it
81358 its not the way i wanted this to go i wanted to be the red auerbach of the dallas mavericks after coaching but thats not what cuban wanted the good news is all this has forced me to continue coaching and im really enjoying working with mully warriors vice president of basketball operations chris mullin and being back with the warriors im having fun again and thats the way it should be its all working out great and ill probably end up doing something in a franchise patriarch role like i thought i was going to do in dallas
81359 i would have been bitter had i lost but i can hold no grudges
81360 ill just be as cordial as i can to cuban from now on

81367 when they need congressional assistance they use the pac to build relationships to work towards achieving a legislative goal other times when they have involuntarily become the object of congressional interest they use the pac to build relationships in an effort to avoid negative legislation
81368 he was a very early supporter of senator obama and began that support long before the senate investigation into tax havens
81369 hes very interested in politics and he gives to both sides
81370 peter lowy never took any action to hide his ownership in anything
81371 peter lowy did not do anything improper or illegal or unethical
81372 the iron ring of secrecy around tax haven banks and their deceptive banking practices enable and encourage tax cheats to hide assets from the united states
81373 this is the first time a congressional committee has ever passed consumer protections for credit cardholders
81374 if you press in one side of the balloon it pokes out on another side of the balloon
81375 the result will be higher costs for consumers reduced access to credit for those with an imperfect or limited credit history and less access to low credit options
81376 people are prepared for the worst but it is still going to be pretty ugly
81377 in the big picture youre helping your team and that has to take precedence over playing time
81378 were going to have to as we go along try to figure it out
81379 i really dont know whos going to get impacted the most on this thing
81380 its just bringing a big bat in the lineup and i think if we stay healthy weve got a good chance
81381 now that we have five outfielders well see what happens i cant say anything
81382 whoever gets to get in the game at that time has to go out there and help the team win any chance they can even if theyre not starting

81694 the important thing is we should also protect the player
81695 if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club im always in favour of protecting the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
81696 i think in football theres too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere
81697 we are trying now to intervene in such cases the reaction to the bosman law is to make long lasting contacts in order to keep the players and then if he wants to leave then there is only one solution he has to pay his contract

81733 is partly because of falling oil prices that is the major reason
81734 the philippine market is quite resilient considering the downward movement of us stocks
81735 what carried us this day is the banking sector the banking sector registered strong lending growth even amid the perceived economic slowdown
81736 were very pleasantly surprised the first half loan demand has been strong
81737 i think going forward depending on how the economy turns out we think we can still do somewhere between 12 and 15 percent for the whole year
81738 the good news is that everyone has been able to hold their costs the bad news is we are revenue challenged everywhere
81739 with inflation there is margin compression and we are suffering it but it encourages us to work harder

81741 so what do the apparently contradictory anglican church of canada general synod same sex votes mean anyway according to incoming primate fred hiltz not much of anything at all
81742 we pour house legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it
81743 lemmings the anglican church of canada starts over the cliff
81744 in a statement about primacy published along with his biographical profile bishop hiltz stated the job of canadian primate
81745 the holy spirit has now it seems told the canadian church that the blessings of ssus is not in conflict with the core doctrine of the anglican church of canada but he only seemed to tell about half the bishops that and quite a few laity werent listening clearly to him or is he saying two different things i have always said the st michaels report was a trojan horse its absurd dealing with various layers of doctrine has now borne its fruit
81746 he is the first bishop who has publicly given his support to same sex marriage so there are concerns of his position
81747 it seems to me that this will go to the wire in the house of bishops

81750 the things i do and say into the sounds of silence ill miss myself when i die the successes of my life and all of my accomplished promises but most of all ill miss all the other things i meant to do
81751 gods magnificence the color of the evening sky sitting on my favorite bench nestled in the oak grove the sound of silence the smile i get from strangers as we pass each other on the street my constant yearning to understand and be understood the pain and heartache from lost love the joy of watching my children being born dogs barking horns honking fights lightening and thunder doing the right thing the battle within when i desperately want to do bad things running my fingers through my daughters curly hair the smell of bacon in the early weekend morning paying taxes catching a bus to work stillness within chaos
81752 he only lost two points on the last set thats terrible for the tennis
81753 right now i know im in a good position because roger has to win everything from here from olympics to us open
81754 but i dont think too much right now i only think about trying to improve my game for tomorrow
81755 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
81756 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
81757 i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open
81758 for the moment its just all a blur so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard
81759 its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
81760 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
81761 i havent played against top 10 players so much in my career so beating one of them gives me more confidence

81806 the whole elementary school has already been budgeted through the next two years
81807 that money is already in the bank were spending less on the land than we had actually budgeted gulf power has been real good to us on the price
81808 its actually a little bit faster than the drop off weve been seeing nationwide and statewide
81809 a time when the economy is uncertain implies you might see increased levels of business failures if you and i dont have money to spend then who is supporting all these retailers
81810 when collateral for a loan is a piece of real estate its very important to know what that piece of real estate will sell for if the loan fails
81811 if we dont know what the market will do to that piece of real estate it creates uncertainty
81812 theyre concerned with small business loans because theres an increased vulnerability because the safety net isnt as strong as it is in a large business
81813 everyones looking at financial statements a little closer because things are arguably more difficult
81814 established existing businesses are still getting treated well but brand new businesses just trying to start up are finding it more difficult
81815 its not who you know its who you get to know that will help you
81816 it is clear that the government will not be in a position in the foreseeable future to grant the projects the natural gas commitment they would require consequently there is no prospect of taking these projects further

81827 what i have to remind myself over and over and over again is that the interruption free life we consider normal is nonexistent
81828 no matter how much i devote myself you have that which i can never attain blood
81829 this how it felt like the first time we did this isnt it
81830 its about time we head back are you satisfied yet
81831 we really want to honor our cold war veterans in the black hills
81832 as we continue to wage todays fight its sometimes easy to forget we once lived under an extremely significant nuclear threat
81833 i encourage our neighbors in the black hills to contact sergeant wilson and get involved our museum has dedicated space to honor our community veterans with this cold war exhibit
81834 the va has had a hideous problem for a decade
81835 the whole point about doing budgeting on a regular basis is to keep reassessing priorities
81836 but you have a very large constituency for not coming to terms with the real cost of the budget and there has been huge growth in advance appropriations
81837 normally the federal budget is giving grants for something to happen but in this case its a direct provision of health care thousands of patients in beds millions of outpatient visits
81838 we have to suck it up and keep the promise that we made
81839 i put it up on par with social security and medicare
81840 herself has said positively that she wants mandatory spending for va health care but we cant get any traction
81841 so our thinking for the past year has been directed to looking at an alternative approach and we stumbled upon this advance appropriations technique
81842 we will still take mandatory spending in a heartbeat if they enact it
81843 but were trying to spread the word that this is the new direction
81844 we set priorities and we make programs compete against each other annually they would like not to have to compete
81845 theres 100 percent agreement with the veterans organizations that we must pass va appropriations on a more timely basis
81846 there may be honest differences on the means of getting there the easiest simplest cleanest way to solve the problem is for us to start passing va appropriations bills on time if that proves to be an impossible task well just have to look at the other options
81847 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
81848 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result

81850 the rec centers are not unsafe its disheartening that inner city children are caught up in this nonsense
81851 weve got parts of this town that are a lot worse that havent had any shootings in their facilities
81852 i dont think it was the neighborhood it just happened to be this one guy knowing where the other guy was going to be it could have happened at the gas station or outside the courthouse it just goes to show you that it can happen anywhere
81853 at a public space such as a recreation center we always recommend that people entering the building have to check in so there is a record
81854 if your facility is already built and you dont have the funds to move your check in desk its important to have a live body there a person with a position of authority who people coming into the facility have to pass by
81855 we basically shared as much information with the public as we could to let them know what was going on
81856 but situations like this are tough its not like you can just go into martial law and start shaking everyone down then people are not going to want to use your facility
81857 the brazen daylight shootings stabbings and murders on the rec center grounds seem to have handcuffed the department as it struggles to maintain its programs
81858 you want to keep youth busy in order to keep violence down
81859 if legitimate users feel safe because of openness visibility and lighting then chances are that the illegitimate users will feel at risk
81860 if the municipality doesnt pay enough attention to that graffiti then law abiding citizens are going to feel afraid like theyre in a bad area
81861 if people are allowed to sit on a park bench and drink beer something that is probably illegal in most jurisdictions it may seem minor people might say we need to focus on the bigger things we just had a homicide but the problem is if you dont focus on those little things theyre going to lead to larger things
81862 whether they consciously make the decision or not theres a decision making process going on when a suspect chooses a location to commit a crime and the environment plays into that
81863 always keep in the back of your mind that we are providing public facilities and these things could always happen
81864 just have a plan in place for when they do
81865 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways

81870 he regretted his behaviour was happy to apologise to the officer concerned and had absented himself from county council and cabinet duties as soon as he was told of the complaint
81871 he said he had no intention of embarrassing the complainant or causing her anxiety believing the incidents had been exaggerated in significance
81872 what occurred undoubtedly were errors of judgment on his part
81873 county councillors especially those of cabinet rank risked damaging the reputation of their office and the interests of the county council in ensuring good working relationships between staff members when behaving in this way

81912 jadi album ini lirik atau nada lebih simple dari album album sebelumnya bisa dibilang kalau album keempat itu adalah eksperimen album kelima adalah pemikiran yang sangat dalam dan album keenam kita buat yang bijaksana kita lebih memikirkan masukan masukan sheila gang
81913 jadi ya alhamdulillah masih ada orang orang seperti sheila gang yang tetap setia setiap ada show
81914 namun demikian komitmen kami kepada penyelenggara untuk dapat terlaksananya konser ini maka kami akan tetap memenuhi sesuai kesepakatan yang sudah dibuat sebelumnya

81924 to my mind they are backing the court into a corner the political pressure cant move the court it just makes it look bad if they did hold a rehearing and changed their mind the sc would look even worse so i dont see the social benefit that comes from having the debate it was a minor mistake that people are using to ding the court with but the real losers here is the overall legitimacy of the system

82051 internet dating is a fairly recent phenomenon and one that is either presented to you very professionally by worldwide dating agencies or by local hacks who are jumping on the dating bandwagon
82052 theres no question i stink im not denying it ive been playing for 17 hours
82053 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
82054 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
82055 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
82056 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
82057 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
82058 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
82059 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
82060 getting the opportunity to play for your country is something that you cant take for granted whether its your first time or your tenth time
82061 i think we have a really good mix of older and younger guys
82062 i kind of fit into the middle of that since i have some international experience but we have some guys like rheal cormier and chris reitsma who are experienced major league guys were definitely going into it with high hopes
82063 we have music you can have a chat you have no troubles when you are dancing
82064 going through all the injuries and stuff like that i had a lot of goals about a year ago
82065 primarily im out there to do my job and represent the usa
82066 you were put on this team for a reason and now you just go out and represent
82067 i was chosen for the team i proved myself in four back to back competitions i showed consistency
82068 every day we are balancing minor injuries but as far as major injuries im good
82069 it was a huge jump for us i think in 2000 when we finished fifth the core of our team was really inexperienced internationally and we were all so young
82070 for a lot of us it was our first paralympics it was the first time wed been in a big event like that but in 2004 we developed together we matured a little bit we participated in other tournaments like world championships and qualifiers the young kids were mature
82071 in 2004 we knew how to prepare i think that is a good way of putting it not that we werent prepared in 2000 but when 2004 came we knew what we needed to do much more so than before
82072 youve got to sit around and watch all the guys continue to practice and you havent taken a snap
82073 he needed to get back a few days ago im not saying he cant play because he hasnt been in but that position offensive line youve got to get work
82074 hes got to get a feel for the speed of the game and everything else all the adjustments and the only way you can get it is by being out there
82075 what a great honor it is to be able to represent my country at the olympic games
82076 i have dreamed of competing in the olympics ever since i was a young girl and to have the opportunity to become an olympic athlete this summer in beijing really is a dream come true
82077 its an accomplishment and a culmination of a lot of work here and the work she has put in outside of here
82078 shes going to comeback with an experience that is life changing and we get to share that with her and thats great for our team
82079 we dont agree with it the ruling and we will seek a court review
82080 defendants argue that they have no animus toward male discharges that their motivation is simply to preclude weapons and contraband from being smuggled into the jail
82081 as already set forth and admitted by defendants however female discharges are also capable of smuggling contraband into the jail
82082 he sends minions who admittedly say they have no authority to negotiate or make any decisions
82083 all they do in the house is just sit and criticize so let the bridges fall let our roads crumble you know let our schools go without the capital needs that they deserve and all they do is complain
82084 the inability of these people to agree on anything is just incredible its criminal its outrageous we cant stand for this
82085 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
82086 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
82087 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
82088 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
82089 that level of critical mass has made it more acceptable to do the outrageous and this is outrageous weve just planted a farm in front of the mayors office
82090 not everyone gets it yet there have been some folks who criticize this as if we are building some farm out in city hall
82091 it was a little up and down because the wildcard invitations get released a little bit later and you have to be approved by your own national committee so that took some time
82092 at wimbledon i actually spent quite a time there practicing and training and that was definitely really good being able to not only play there but to practice as well
82093 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
82094 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season
82095 while jamar will always be a part of the illinois basketball family i have made the decision that he can no longer be a part of our team our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation
82096 the final four was one of the best experiences of my life but having the chance to represent your country and compete at the highest level possible you cant even imagine what its going to feel like
82097 ive heard stories of how special the opening ceremonies are so youre really not going to know until you get over there but definitely i put winning a gold medal up there with winning an nba championship its that special
82098 its an honor for me to be on this team and an honor for me to represent my country in the olympics
82099 ive always dreamed about playing in the olympics growing up watching the dream team and watching them get a gold medal im just thrilled to death to have the opportunity and the privilege to play on this team and look forward to winning the gold medal
82100 williams has the desire and ambition and that is just as important in international competition as talent to have a makeup of guys who are willing to give their time and effort who want to be there and most importantly want to win
82101 i know that illini fans will now watch the olympics with even more interest it is a great source of pride to have one of our own competing on the worlds biggest stage

82132 going electric helps to ensure precision that can make a rider faster and reduce mental fatigue if you think about formula one racing the race cars use automatic and clutchless transmissions because the computer can create a faster more synchronized and consistent shift than a skilled driver can manually
82133 that being said those same technologies can improve performance for anyone and there is a certain novelty factor for those enthusiasts that like to indulge in the latest high tech equipment or use the same equipment that professionals use
82134 the shifters do have some articulation for the benefit of the human interface feedback loop but they really are just buttons that are designed to operate in a manner similar to traditional sti so that the transition from mechanical to electronic would be very intuitive

82151 but the core group of players that we have here we expect to have here for a long time we expect lance berkman to be here we expect carlos lee and roy oswalt and miguel tejada to be here certainly hunter pence we could have traded hunter to 100 different teams over the last couple of weeks if we wanted to do something like that we believe in the core nucleus that we have here if we can add players that give us more long term options wed love to be able to do that the one deal that we talked about thursday would have given us that opportunity
82152 we are paying attention to the future paying attention to the future from the standpoint that we have a chance to get possibly the top 21 guys that we selected in the draft done this year so were operating on both sides of the street at this point in trying to be good now and for the long term
82153 the important thing is to keep playing hard and stay positive i was in this situation before in oakland its not just one chance to make the playoffs there are two chances
82154 we have the team to do it the pitchings really shown a lot of potential lately with roy healthy we have a good pitching staff
82155 carlos lee and berkman will do their thing if me and miggy and kaz matsui get hot we could make it happen
82156 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
82157 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
82158 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
82159 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
82160 we dont like the fact that we allowed their fans to come into our park and have a four day party but thats our fault
82161 hes definitely one of my favorite teammates ive ever had
82162 you can really tell a lot about a guys character when theyre not doing as good
82163 he doesnt mope around he genuinely roots for his teammates
82164 heres a guy who has won an mvp award and you dont sense any kind of jealousy or competition he really wants everybody to do well sometimes with a star player like miguel thats a rare quality
82165 i just like the fact that his attitude stays pretty much the same whether hes going well or not going well hes pretty much the same guy i met in the spring he still plays hard every day
82166 i think hes played well when you look at overall numbers
82167 when you look at everything hes really better than i thought
82168 we think theres more than enough left in the tank for miguel to be a cornerstone player for us
82169 i love winning i love being on the field every day i love playing hard every day youve got to keep at it every day anything can happen
82170 what a great guy i can relate to him hes really giving me no cause for alarm or concern speed happens
82171 i made many ambulance runs from schertz into guadalupe county

82173 we kind of had a hole in the county in this area we were already served by seguin and schertz ems but having this here is a big accomplishment for everyone residing in this part of the county
82174 when the mayor contacted me we got excited about the idea its not a huge demand out here but its growing steadily
82175 weve spent a lot of time talking about the things we need to have to be a successful community and this is an important step for us
82176 this facility is here primarily because of the diligence of my good friend and mayor glenn hild
82177 ive always thought schertz emss service to our community was exceptional and that in the city of schertz we had an exceptional friend to our west kind of a big brother when weve needed something over the years theyve always stepped forward to help i hope one day we can do something for them
82178 it had grown into a community event and was too big for any one group to put on
82179 we want them to know were here and we want to show them what we can do
82180 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
82181 there has definitely been added edge i suppose the guys have been a bit niggly at training and that always shows that theres an edge there
82182 we have just got to make sure that we use that to put together a performance we have to be smart about the way we play but also bring the physical side of things and the aggression if we are to get what we are after
82183 we have analysed the sydney game and spent quite a bit of time doing that as a group of coaches and as a team we have trained to rectify those things trained it well and hopefully it comes through in the game
82184 as we have said before its a totally different game to what we have played over the years we are bedding down the tactics its not until you really face the challenge and you have come up short that you really have to think deeply about whats going on there
82185 i watch a bit of rugby i watch a bit of rugby on video and try to analyse the game
82186 its a test match this week stands alone its not an issue
82187 we monitor and manage our weeks according to our state i think these guys are in better shape now for this challenge than they were in week one or week two
82188 these guys will be up for this they have a challenge that is very clear how significant that challenge is its obvious for all to see but they are very excited by that challenge they are standing at the foot of the hill and they are ready to climb they are waiting for the whistle
82189 individuals making sure that they can make their tackles thats what probably let us down a little bit just individuals missing tackles
82190 so we made sure the guys are aware of that and theyll rectify it and make sure they know what to do next time they come up against him
82191 ever since the first test against ireland weve had to do a fair bit of scrambling so theyve become adept at defending well covering each other
82192 only 4 more months 122 more days 17 more weeks
82193 struggle as hard as you can for whatever you believe in
82194 rajni fans have also ordered special customised candies with his face we have started kuselan and friendship online contest for 25 pairs of free tickets sponsored by us also distribution of audio cds to be given with premiere show tickets are some of the unique marketing techniques we have adopted
82195 vancouver has everything i love but its not the place that grew me up
82196 im touching my food i think i lost my knife are you facing me are your eyes open
82197 well im just following in the footsteps of the prior year person
82198 alle yin sind rein aber shou tai yin ist der chef der f nf organe er dirigiert alle energien des k rpers er entspricht der himmelsenergie
82199 ein guter akupunkteur behandelt zuerst die haut dann das fleisch dann die muskel und die gef e dann die hohlorgane und zuletzt die organe
82200 darum hei t es verschiedentlich auch dass haut muskeln sehnen sowie leitbahnen verschiedene stellen innerhalb des k rpers einnehmen und dass die jeweiligen unterschiedlichsten krankheitsbilder auch in unterschiedlichster weise auf die jeweiligen behandlungsmethoden ansprechen
82201 bei jenen stellen wo sich das qi bemerkbar macht handelt es sich um jene wo der geist des qi seinen ein und ausgang im fluss nimmt es handelt sich dabei also nicht um solche stellen wo sich haut muskeln sehnen und knochen befinden
82202 ist innen das qi der f nf zang organe bereits ersch pft und will man daher mit der nadelung eine stabilisierung des u eren qi des yang erreichen so wird dies eine verst rkung des qi ersch pfung genannt ist auf einen versto gegen das prinzip des qi gleichgewichts zur ckzuf hren eine ersch pfung des qi der f nf zang organe au en bei einer stabilisierung des inneren qi durch nadelung wird umgekehrte ersch pfung genannt wird dadurch herbeigef hrt dass entgegen dem prinzip des qi ausgleichs die nadel fehlerhaft an den punktstellen im bereich der vier extremit ten eingef hrt wird
82203 das geheimnis um den einsatz der neun nadeln beinhaltet somit eigentlich
82204 unterweisung zu den nadelungsmethoden bei all diesen methoden geht es auch um das nahrungsqi ying qi abwehrqi wei qi xue und das qi schlechthin
82205 der fluss der energie in den meridianen stellt den menschen dar

82207 die 3 teile der pulse fu schranke daumen des linken handgelenks stellen das blut xue dar das vom essenz yin ist die 3 teile der pulse fu schranke daumen des rechten handgelenks stellen die energie qi dar das von essenz yang ist wenn das yang exzessiv gest rt ist gibt es yin symptome wenn das yin exzessiv gest rt ist gibt es yang symptome
82208 die y ng und sh punkte kontrollieren die energie die au erhalb der hauptmeridiane flie t und die sh punkte kontrolliere die energie die innerhalb der hauptmeridiane flie t
82209 die zw lf hauptmeridiane stehen alle mit den fu und zang organen in verbindung im k rperinneren nach au en hin sind sie mit den gliedma en und den gelenken verbunden

82211 wenn die st rung im bereich des blutes liegt soll man die punkte ying stechen wenn man auf die energie einwirken will soll man die punkte wei stechen wenn ein meridian im oberen bereich des k rpers in f lle ist w hrend der untere bereich in leere ist ist ein sekund rgef der die verbindung st rt daran schuld dieses gef ist horizontal in der h he des entsprechenden shu punktes da sp rt man eine verh rtung in diesem fall soll man sofort stechen
82212 die energie zh ng q ist verschr nkt mit der pathogenen energie xi q wenn die pathogene energie in f lle ist ist die energie des menschen in leere das ist nicht die passende zeit zu tonisieren um zu tonisieren soll man abwarten bis die perverse energie abschw cht wenn die perverse energie den k rper v llig verlassen hat wird sich die energie des k rpers automatisch von selber erholen in diesem moment soll man die energie des k rpers nicht dispergieren deswegen lautet die satzung nicht stechen nachjagend dispergierend die weggehende pathogene energie nicht stechen dispergierend die energie des k rpers in voller aufschwung es ist evident dass man tonisieren soll im falle der leere dispergieren im falle der f lle und bluten wenn kongestion vorliegt wenn man sticht kann man erkennen ob es um leere oder f lle geht leichtes einstechen ist zeichen der leere schweres einstechen ist zeichen der f lle
82213 last i saw they were going into vins room i dont think were going to see them again anytime soon

82218 and what are you going to stop it we are all adults here now we can take responsibility for ourselves
82219 yes but i am the only one in this house hired to work the case
82220 which reminds me how is vin supposed to pay his rent now that hes unemployed
82221 why not is there a rule that says people the fbi hires for a particular job cant finish the job if they get injured
82222 so you add insult to injury by taking way his livelihood
82223 stay out of this vin im trying to get your job back
82224 if id wanted to deal with all the rules and regulations id have stayed in the fbi to begin with me and them arent a good mix present company excepted

82230 ive been unable to make or receive calls on my mobile all morning
82231 after a 50 minute wait listening to the optus telephone on hold rubbish i was told by someone that service will be affecting quite a lot of melbournians at least till sic midday
82232 i am in sydney cbd and have not been able to do anything pretty much since this morning the network keeps coming on and off and when i have tried to sms or call it goes straight to no service
82233 its very clear there isnt going to be a deal but nobody is going to say that out loud its better to show the process is still going on
82234 trade was great if i could find a stronger word than great i would use that
82235 while growth continues to be disappointing trade provides one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economic picture raising questions about barack obamas policy of economic isolationism
82236 lets see how this works before we throw any more short term money at the economy
82237 nothing in todays gdp numbers was positive for families trying to find a job or pay to fill up their tank
82238 that is why we need a second 50 billion stimulus package that both relieves the burden on middle class families and helps to jump start job creation
82239 the consumer adds only 1 1 percentage point to overall growth and this is with a rebate check in hand
82240 gdp was net negative on the domestic front as we look to the second half of the year foreign growth is fading so u s exports are sure to slow also the rebate checks no longer are a factor meanwhile the housing sector is still a negative
82241 we have long held that the best measure of the economy most consumers interact with on a daily basis is final sales to domestic purchasers
82242 on this basis the economy has actually been weaker than it was in the last recession
82243 if you really want to sell something ask your customers what they really want and then wow them
82244 luxury cruises in europe a division of special places travel
82245 teaching units what they needed to know before they went over to a combat area we pretty much put them through a month long simulation of combat
82246 it was more of like there wasnt a lot of action it was more of its hard to explain down there action over there is like getting ied or maybe getting shot at a few times or a car bomb goes off its not exactly what youre expecting its more like hunting season youre the deer
82247 in my case i had lost a lot while i was over there and it just started the more you lose and the less they do for you the more you start to see how jacked up things really are
82248 and theres plenty they could do and they just they did nothing i lost a lot of money i lost my family while i was there you know pretty much and when i get back id lost so much it was like i needed to start over
82249 man i got to have a reset i got to find a way to get myself out of this and start over start my life over you know i have nothing to work with
82250 in other iraq news the british government has announced there will be no prosecutions over the death of journalist terry lloyd despite an investigation that blamed us troops terry lloyd was shot dead in iraq in march 2003 along with a french cameraman and an iraqi interpreter two years ago a british coroner ruled that us troops should be prosecuted for the unlawful killing of lloyd who was a well known foreign correspondent for the british television network itn the coroner ruled that lloyd was shot in the back by iraqi soldiers then as he was being driven to a hospital in a civilian minivan lloyd was shot in the head by us troops
82251 coroner andrew walker concluded just under two years ago that terry lloyd was unlawfully killed by american troops and itn has done everything it could to try and ensure terrys killer is brought to justice we are disappointed that the cps has decided they cannot take this matter further and that despite the coroners call on the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions to demand that the americans bring the perpretator of a possible war crime before a british court of law the us authorities remain unco operative
82252 any accusations against a journalist should be aired publicly and dealt with fairly and swiftly with the journalist having the right to counsel and present a defense
82253 often stayed late at his fathers newsroom in kirkuk the editor in chief of the weekly voice of villages ali taha treated his son as a journalist in training the teen listened to pop music and was obsessed with computer games he loved the weekly trips he took with his father to sites in the area the most recent trip was to the dokan dam the primary water source in kirkuk he loved to stay late into the night at the voice of villages newsroom a u s supported weekly and help in any way he could who knows what he wouldve been when he grew up who knows what life he wouldve lived god had other plans his father said
82254 this has been a month of encouraging news from iraq
82255 this week the iraqi government is launching a new offensive in parts of the diyala province that contain some of al qaedas few remaining safe havens in the country this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
82256 unofficial deadline for the deal has long been july 31 also the white house announced late on wednesday that president bush would make a statement on iraq on thursday morning
82257 in terms of negotiations those are ongoing and i wont go into detail on those
82258 hint when the numbers being given out do not match its a hype action
82259 a u s soldier died in a non combat related incident while conducting operations in ninewah province july 31 additionally two other u s soldiers were injured in the incident
82260 the department of defense announced today the death of a soldier who was supporting operation iraqi freedom
82261 rapper ludacris obama declined to comment after their meeting but walked with chris bridges ludacris legal name to the elevator as he left
82262 obama seeking to become the first african american president was not helped by a song by the grammy award winning rapper ludacris endorsing him and abusing mccain george bush and clinton
82263 on youtube yesterday rapper ludacris released a song called politics in which he denigrates president bush sen hillary rodham clinton d n y and sen john mccain r ariz all in the space of about two minutes in the next line the three time grammy award winner calls clinton an irreleveant slur for female
82264 wow thats fantastic but you need an adult to help you out because you have to be a registered voter
82265 but before we get into logistics i dont often get calls from 16 year olds can you tell me how you know about ralph
82266 two years ago mr nader came to my high school
82267 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech
82268 i was a freshman and i was in world history class and my class didnt go i guess they thought that ralph didnt fit with world history
82269 yeah but ive been interested in mr nader since then reading about him and i want to help him
82270 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people
82271 this may be the most severe economic downturn since the depression
82272 i dont know everything cuomo did i know he was trying governor pataki was trying governor spitzer was trying
82273 the candidate that would help john mccain win new york would probably be a resurrection
82274 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
82275 im happy and thankful we do have the death penalty
82276 when you lose a family member the way we lost one its the first thing on your mind in the morning and the last thing at night it doesnt ever escape your mind
82277 i didnt come here to see a man die i came for my own personal satisfaction to try to get closure to this
82278 i dont mind being punished for something i did not for something i didnt do
82279 the confession is the thing he talks about how he got the knife told him how to do it stuck his foot across the guys throat to show how to asphyxiate him its pretty chilling
82280 wardrip would not have been sentenced to death had his defense counsel presented any evidence about his nearly spotless prison record and his commendable behavior during his prior eleven year incarceration
82281 has relied repeatedly on the enforceability of this and other treaty obligations abroad
82282 if we do not keep our promises to our international partners we lose the ability to protect our own citizens abroad and damage our nations reputation as a reliable player on the world stage
82283 committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner
82284 shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations
82285 subject to the proviso however that the said laws must enable full effect to be given to the purposes
82286 the world court has no standing in texas and texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court
82287 it is easy to get caught up in discussions of international law and justice and treaties its very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens
82288 perhaps hemlock is the answer for all the bleeding hearts who completely forget about the victims and their suffering
82289 and we should worry that these horses patoots should have a bit of pain awareness of anything give me a break
82290 ordinarily used to render a surgical patient unconscious for mere minutes only in the induction phase of anesthesia specifically so that the patient may reawaken and breathe on his own power if any complications arise
82291 suffocate to death while experiencing an intense conscious desire to inhale
82292 injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death
82293 torture or ill treatment or unnecessary pain should be inflicted
82294 the written protocol is effectively irrelevant to the reality of how texas carries out execution by lethal injection in practice
82295 demonstrates that the tdcjs assertions that the protocol is applied in texas just as it is in kentucky are unsupported allegations and in large measure simply false
82296 materially indistinguishable from texas protocol chis eighth amend ment claim has no merit
82297 apparently the court will not tolerate actual litigation of the issue if it means the death machine meanwhile must stand idle
82298 but we cannot fix the machine while the cogs are turning
82299 a sentencing statute must not only narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty it must also ensure sentencing decisions are based upon an individual inquiry
82300 the texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to be put to death merely for being a party because the law of parties cannot be applied in answering the special issues
82301 i believe the right and just decision is to commute fosters sentence
82302 there will be a full package going to the governor and i think you will see a lot of similarities between us and foster
82303 jeff was just dumb hes so trusting of people and has to get burned in order to learn a lesson
82304 even the pope is elected by his peers but what the anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
82305 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
82306 he is not deteriorating or progressing he is still the same
82307 we have done the best we can and now hope for a medical miracle we never know it could happen
82308 board members have had ample time to study the agreement and ask questions of india and the iaea inspectorate
82309 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
82310 friday will constitute a major step forward in the wider effort to
82311 my conviction is that this deal strengthens the non proliferation regime it makes india a stakeholder
82312 board members have had ample time to study the agreement and ask questions of india and the iaea inspectorate
82313 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
82314 friday will constitute a major step forward in the wider effort to
82315 my conviction is that this deal strengthens the non proliferation regime it makes india a stakeholder
82316 i have always thought that tony veitch was a better kicker than dan and right now we need a bit of backbone in the mid field
82317 most americans know in their gut that weve got to change
82318 but the reason they spend all their time talking about me is they just dont have any new ideas
82319 because of his age his inexperience his race even his name
82320 ive often said that this election represents a defining moment in our history
82321 for too many americans the dream of opportunity is slipping away thats why the decisions we make over the next few years will shape a generation if not a century
82322 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
82323 all of those negative ads that hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices
82324 the fact is these washington tactics do the american people a disservice by trying to distract us from the very real challenges that we face
82325 because it provided the biggest boost to alternative energy including wind power for example which has gone up a huge amount as a consequence of the credits in there
82326 held hostage by the desire of the oil companies to do more drilling
82327 what caused that is that people cant afford to drive
82328 if we could bring immediate relief to the people simply by opening offshore drilling then i would consider it the truth of the matter is that gives us a few cents saving ten to twelve years from now
82329 i am sure that there was a lot of pushing and pulling to get this thing drafted but obviously it had to be done
82330 the dni is firmly in charge now and thats a good thing
82331 this is part of a systemic problem of the administration and i said im not going to take it anymore
82332 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
82333 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
82334 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
82335 we dont look back in anger i heard you say
82336 hes got a long way to go hell need a prosthesis
82337 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
82338 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all
82339 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
82340 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
82341 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgeon of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
82342 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
82343 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
82344 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
82345 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
82346 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
82347 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisers in this or any other context
82348 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
82349 require more than a mailed statement to assist them in finding ways to address their illness and compulsion
82350 thats what i look at every day thats what i consider to be our paradise back there
82351 the soil is turning out to be different than what was expected
82352 that is a good question and one of the things we are tossing around right now
82353 of all the things that could have gone wrong that was the least likely on anyones list
82354 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
82355 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
82356 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
82357 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails
82358 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
82359 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
82360 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
82361 it is im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and we dont theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
82362 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
82363 campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have raised
82364 save all components of the assembly into a single file
82365 in contrast to english the words for socialist anarchist politics and economics do not have negative connotations
82366 finally finally they got a young beautiful woman in here
82367 why do you hate me youre mad at me yeah you are you hate me
82368 well ya see i am an orphan ya see and mr and mrs pollick adopted me a strong irish family they had five kids the pollicks
82369 well ya see mr smith gave me a room over his body shop i was 8 or 9 and my parents died in a car accident and mr smith said i could stay in a room over his shop i had a morning paper route and an evening paper route one day it was snowing and bobby pollick saw me and said can i help you and i said i dont need your help and he said yes you do so bobby finished my route with me and then he asked why dont you come over for dinner and at dinner the whole family had prepared for this mrs pollick asked me where i was going after dinner and i told her i was going back to my bed one of the kids spoke up then mom weve got room upstairs let bill stay here there were two boys that slept in a bed up in the attic it was hot as hell in the summer and freezing in the winter the three of us boys slept in that bed for the next fourteen years
82370 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
82371 a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
82372 married couples relying on income aside from social security and making 75 000 at retirement have a 31 chance of running out of money those who rely on only social security have a 90 chance of ending up broke
82373 dude shes going to the kounty korners you really wanna mess with that
82374 brandon had better command than he did in arizona we had opportunities we just couldnt cash in
82375 in my eyes this is the biggest series this season for us
82376 were trying to take at least three of four ive had some luck against the dodgers i had pretty good stuff tonight
82377 verjongen sommige planten en kruiden worden houterig en schriel na een tijd vooral als ze een paar jaar niet gesnoeid zijn
82378 kalau itu semangat dan cita cita memang siapa yang tidak ingin maju harus dipelihara semangat itu
82379 saya ingatkan tidak ada jalan pintas tidak ada yang seperti membalikkan telapak tangan
82380 its the taste of frozen pizza and microwaved noodles its the smell of old spice and dirty socks it can only mean one thing guys are moving into the b again
82381 saya harus ingatkan dalam roadmap bali tentang pemanasan global ditegaskan provisi keuangan dan insentif lain diarahkan untuk memperluas transfer teknologi ramah lingkungan dari negara maju ke negara berkembang
82382 kita sadar di negara berkembang dampak negatif perubahan iklim juga dibarengi dengan ketidakmampuan sdm sumber daya manusia karena kekurangan teknologi dan keuangan
82383 were always looking to see what we can do to enhance our business strategically financially and operationally
82384 that is always on the table and were constantly reviewing our options yes
82385 this is the one that we have elected to go forward and study in greater detail
82386 fundamentally what marathons board is looking at here is we are convinced the market isnt seeing the full value here so to maximize the value for shareholders we will consider splitting up
82387 we think the large integrated players are being rated lower than the large pure upstream players
82388 heretofore marathons value has been depressed by the companys group leading refining leverage which has hampered the companys ability to translate higher oil and natural gas prices into earnings growth particularly relative to peers
82389 ultimately it would probably show itself to be a strong player
82390 i also want to say a big whats up to the kids who hung out for awhile in the front of the building good times
82391 this is perfect even the imperfect is great i love it here
82392 if something went wrong first blame it on the department who caused it second allocate the cost of it to that department third measure performance of a department based on its cost and finally grow the organizations sales this bred a culture of blame and the ultimate victim were clients
82393 well if nobody does anything to you that you dont do to yourself where are you cheating yourself

82395 i knew it months ago i knew it the moment it started
82396 so why did you act surprised when he told you didnt you already know
82397 yes i knew but i didnt want to know i just wanted to think i was wrong so when i questioned him and he denied it i was happy
82398 you want his loyalty but you wont give it to yourself

82407 recent discoveries have shown that life can exist in the most extreme conditions indeed it is possible that bacterial spores can lie dormant in bitterly cold dry and airless conditions for millions of years and become activated once conditions become favorable such dormant microbial colonies may exist in the martian arctic where due to the periodic wobbling of the planet liquid water may exist for brief periods about every 100 000 years making the soil environment habitable phoenix will assess the habitability of the martian northern environment by using sophisticated chemical experiments to assess the soils composition of life giving elements such as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and hydrogen identified by chemical analysis phoenix will also look at reduction oxidation redox molecular pairs that may determine whether the potential chemical energy of the soil can sustain life as well as other soil properties critical to determine habitability such as ph and saltiness
82408 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
82409 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
82410 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
82411 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
82412 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare

82423 it looks like the same species that was up the river thames a few years ago
82424 the problem is this species is a deep diving whale and the closest water of depth required is off the bay of biscay about a two day cruise for a whale
82425 the trouble is they feed on deep sea squid and there arent many of them in the english channel

82451 it is reflective of the failure of political will across the board on everything that has to do with darfur and sudan
82452 it means a way of responding timely to incidents as they occur around the darfur region and the troops can respond rapidly to incidents when they are developing
82453 it is becoming very difficult to help darfuris on the ground who are suffering from continual attacks
82454 people who are familiar with operations in iraq and afghanistan would know that the lives of soldiers and civilians and chances of surviving from injuries improve dramatically with access to helicopters
82455 the member states of the security council and especially the p5 britain france russia china and the u s have authorised the icc to investigate the killing in sudan theyve authorised the hybrid protection force theyve authorised ambassador salim to launch a peace process that would conclude with an agreement for sudan
82456 in each case however when required to provide back up efforts it failed and the failure to provide helicopters has direct consequences for the people on the ground and for the peacekeepers
82457 no heavy lift helicopters have been transferred or provided making it impossible for the force to be mobile confront aggression or even defend itself
82458 since january first according to the secretary general 190 000 darfuris have been displaced and nine people have lost their lives
82459 from the perspective of the coalition it is outrageous that the members of the security council send troops into a conflict zone without the minimum of the equipment needed to protect themselves
82460 i encourage european governments and the united states to come forward and tell the world what theyve got available and what they can make available

82464 when the council was truly united it was a formidable force
82465 the notion that you can enforce a peace is wrong
82466 what you can do is deter spoilers on the margins of a conflict but peace has to be made by those who made war
82467 i have seen in a number of places from liberia to haiti to sierra leone where a difference was made insufficient imperfect but a difference was made and i think it is important for the united nations to be able to continue to make that difference because for many people it is their only hope and the united nations is the institution of last resort

82474 isnt this the same mentality that allowed 2 or 3 idiots with box cutters to take out the twin towers
82475 they all watched and the bus driver had to ask a trucker to help him keep the guy in the bus
82476 no handguns allowed in canada we know but no woman had a purse to bonk him on the head
82477 no one bothered to throw a can of diet coke at the guys head who was on the bus the old ladies home and gardening society

82484 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
82485 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it

82487 we shared our perception about our bilateral relations the composite dialogue and certain recent events

82490 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
82491 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
82492 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
82493 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
82494 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
82495 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living
82496 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
82497 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
82498 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
82499 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
82500 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
82501 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
82502 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
82503 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
82504 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
82505 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
82506 any offer from umno to set up a joint government at all levels does not arise
82507 i would like to reiterate our stand to remain in pakatan by playing an active and positive role in line with our collective struggle including our fight to change the government in this context we would like to invite umno mps to join pakatan either through pas or pkr so that we can support this struggle together
82508 there is nothing confidential now we have said that we can meet and of course the meetings would be made known to the party and all these while too they previous pas umno talks have always been made known to the party
82509 i have used the word pertemuan meeting in general it does not matter what term is used

82514 the pension benefit guaranty corporation must comply with our subpoena the administration s dismissal of a legally enforceable congressional subpoena is completely unacceptable
82515 as the u s district court affirmed just today executive branch officials must fully comply with congressional subpoenas and provide all non privileged documents i take seriously our committee s constitutional mandate to investigate matters subject to our legislative jurisdiction and expect the agency to cease its lawless intransigence
82516 ford s support of the usla lifeguard championships fits well with our ongoing commitment to l a and the millions of southern californians who use its beaches
82517 ford has supported heal the bay and its beach report card since 1995 and our partnerships with the usla and the los angeles county lifeguards further underscore our dedication to keeping local beaches clean safe and enjoyable
82518 as the largest lifeguard organization in the world we have always blazed the trail for the profession

82520 cynical manipulation of those dedicated public servants who can least afford the loss of pay and jobs in the current economic crisis
82521 arnold schwarzeneggers response to the budget impasse is a cynical manipulation of those dedicated public servants who can least afford the loss of pay and jobs in the current economic crisis
82522 arnolds apparent indifference to promoting visionary policies such as a simple majority to approve a budget suggest that he is too beholden to the state legislatures minority party to make the hard decisions necessary to minimize this annual extortion ritual and insure a more stable economic future for state employees agencies and the professional and social services that serve californias tax paying residents
82523 when we began our goal was to offer musicians a place to interact in the virtual community
82524 in the late nineties if musicians wanted to sell a guitar or an amp they would post it on craigslist but it would show up between a posting for a toaster oven and a used futon we wanted to create a space like craigslist dedicated to the needs of musicians exclusively craigslist helped us do that and since then weve changed a lot

82532 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways

82586 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
82587 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
82588 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
82589 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
82590 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
82591 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
82592 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime

82608 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public

82610 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
82611 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
82612 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
82613 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
82614 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
82615 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean

82628 bisa saja nama jenderal sutanto diusulkan kembali karena masa pensiunnya bisa diperpanjang atau nama nama lain seperti makbul padmanegara wakapolri bambang hendarso kabareskrim imam haryatna kababinkam dan gories mere kalakhar bnn
82629 kita menunggu siapa siapa saja yang diusulkan presiden ke dpr baru kami mengambil sikap di komisi iii nanti dengan mempelajari rakor polhukam
82630 beautiful and conceptual with amazing art direction and style whether hes working on a high end european luxury piece or what might be considered a more mainstream brand cyril always challenges himself to bring something surprising and creative to the work
82631 we want to be a platform company and a platform for different competitions

82638 we hope you are as pleased as we are that he has tapped senator clinton to deliver one of the most important messages of that crucial week the very role that barack obama had four years ago
82639 regretfully this means that senator hillary clinton is no longer under consideration as senator obamas running mate
82640 it was said as though it was a done deal
82641 having been through many types of hiring processes until you decide on who it will be i dont think you can rule out who it wont
82642 you dont hear it so much from the obama campaign and from senator clinton herself
82643 because it seems that senator obama has made his decision to offer the slot on the ticket to another candidate we believe that continuing to ask him to pick hillary is no longer helpful to our partys chances of winning in november
82644 you cant prototype quickly without frameworks harnesses and libraries it takes time to build those tools creating dozens of prototypes with our shipping pressures just isnt realistic
82645 peace it does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise trouble or hard work it means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart
82646 we have found an innovative way to kill the virus by finding this small region of hiv that is unchangeable
82647 the oromo have been repressed for so long their labor unrewarded their history wiped out that to have the oromo name on their own coffee thats huge
82648 its like the difference between being called you and being called by your real name
82649 its almost embarrassing how gushing they are in their gratitude
82650 they tell me thank you for being so brave to acknowledge what we are going through and to stand with us
82651 many people started sharing stories about their lives in ethiopia the movie had created a space for them remember and share they talked about living in ethiopia and the families they left behind i was really touched i didnt expect that
82652 to not always be talking about tragedy but to recognize the land where the coffee is grown
82653 sometimes weve asked ourselves hey do we need to do something about this
82654 this is about creating the chance for oromos in the twin cities to tell their story about the farmers and the land where this coffee is coming from the outpouring of love and friendship has been real positive
82655 how would you go about setting up such a firm
82656 how would you go about finding and landing government contracts
82657 its very clear there isnt going to be a deal but nobody is going to say that out loud its better to show the process is still going on
82658 this time of year its mainly a lot of rumors and not much action this is action and as fans thats what you like
82659 weve kind of held on to that for the last three years since we put ourselves in a better position
82660 weve really kind of kept one mindset one focus if we play up to our capabilities well win ballgames
82661 obviously its another bat a bat to be dealt with in their lineup but theres the other side of the ball that youve got to play him and andruw jones side by side in the outfield
82662 we know how good a hitter he can be and anytime you add manny ramirez to your lineup you get better if you can get andruw jones to hit too
82663 i dont know maybe its different going from the american league to the national league and i dont know what protection hell have in the lineup and some peoples playing time will be different but it should be fun weve got a good lineup too i love it
82664 ill go out there and try to approach him the same way
82665 they made a move and feel like they strengthened their club itll be interesting to see what happens
82666 foster said he bunted at him and i just wanted him to check and see
82667 span got hit with a ball and i didnt think he bunted at him but marty was right to throw me out you cant argue balls and strikes
82668 it got a little nuts out there i felt bad it stopped the ballgame i dont like that im just out there arguing for my team thats all kicking the hat was probably a little much
82669 if he ever needs a kicker i got good height on it
82670 i think the umpires do a good job and take control of the situation i was not worried about hats i saw a couple of balls flying on the field and it was a dangerous situation
82671 everything from a hat to a beer bottle to a football a nerf football it was different it was something i had never seen before ill leave it at that
82672 i knew gardy was going to throw his hat eventually
82673 thats his go to move he usually doesnt kick it that was kind of entertaining
82674 for some reason i like artest because in the games we play against him i hate him when i text messaged with luis we talked about team chemistry thats only what worries us we worry about the new attitude to the team we are adding talent to the team and we need that but building team chemistry is important this is not bad i dont mean he is not welcome to houston but a new player always needs some time also he was the biggest part of a team in sacramento he was a star player we need more chemistry and more communication
82675 theres worry obviously yes we will think about it of course hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands i havent talked to ron yet so its hard to say i have to find a way to talk to him and see what we can do as a basketball team he has a history but we know he is a physical player he is a good player he really can help us and ron is on a contract year too i think is a good player if coach rick adelman can control the team well
82676 you cant prototype quickly without frameworks harnesses and libraries it takes time to build those tools creating dozens of prototypes with our shipping pressures just isnt realistic
82677 but in this case they truly lack ethics and morals
82678 newcastle have invested a lot in this guy and do not want to lose a lot of money the club do not care a damn about the law it shocks me
82679 i just want to get on with my life and move on from this
82680 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
82681 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
82682 he told the police he had nothing to do with this
82683 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways
82684 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
82685 il tuo capo morto adesso tu sei il nuovo presidente
82686 hey what do you think about this campaign ey ow ow
82687 oh its so confusing why dont you just call it house
82688 it is now possible for more people than ever to collaborate and compete in real time with more people on more different kinds of work from more different corners of the planet and on a more equal footing than at any previous time in the history of the world
82689 when the world is flat you can innovate without having to emigrate
82690 when i compare our high schools to what i see when im traveling abroad i am terrified for our work force of tomorrow in math and science our fourth graders are among the top students in the world by eighth grade theyre in the middle of the pack by 12th grade u s students are scoring near the bottom of all industrialized nations the percentage of a population with a college degree is important but so are sheer numbers in 2001 india graduated almost a million more students from college than the united states did china graduates twice as many students with bachelors degrees as the u s and they have six times as many graduates majoring in engineering in the international competition to have the biggest and best supply of knowledge workers america is falling behind
82691 in china today bill gates is britney spears in america today britney spears is britney spears and that is our problem

82693 i sat in the bushes for weeks with a flashlight and a gun but didnt catch them
82694 hmmm looks like theres nothing in that burger i pick it up oh there is something in there
82695 we have a damn tough job in front of us as any olympic person that wants to shoot for a medal has but i think theres definitely opportunities there for some medals
82696 i was olympic champion at my first games and it was very hard to continue on at the four more olympics after that by winning gold medals
82697 as a young guy going to the olympic games at 19 years of age there is not really a lot of expectation on your shoulders
82698 but because i won as an individual at my first games everyone expected me to win everything i did from that point in time onwards in terms of paddling
82699 that took its toll on my performance in 1996 i won every world cup and lost the olympic games
82700 i learnt a valuable lesson then and that was to make sure i take care of number one and get the results on the day i want the results to come
82701 in sydney it was a real rollercoaster ride for me
82702 i prepared very very well for the games and my girlfriend at the time my wife now her father was killed in a road accident two and a half weeks before the olympics
82703 it gave me a little bit of bump and roll and i didnt quite get up too well from it i ended up just going into the games quite ill and didnt perform at all and got knocked out in the semi finals
82704 i went home and that was probably the olympic games that made me realise what life is all about
82705 i got a learning curve about my own performance in 1996 and then i got a learning curve about what is really important to me and what i wanted to do in 2000
82706 nathan and i naturally had a fairly quick learning curve because we were only together about nine weeks of the preparation and ended up with a silver medal in athens
82707 after 1996 that was my last international world or olympic medal it was an eight year drought before i got another one
82708 it was a real challenge and that i suppose was my major learning curve in life about persistence
82709 2004 didnt leave me with the best taste in my mouth coming second and being so close
82710 i did the fastest time that i have ever paddled in a mens 1000m single at the trials this year
82711 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
82712 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
82713 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
82714 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
82715 new uncertainties and destabilising factors in the international environment are increasing
82716 chinas domestic economy is facing increasing difficulties and challenges we will aim to maintain steady and fast economic growth on the one hand and control excessively growing prices on the other
82717 by hosting the beijing games we will show the world that the chinese people are a peace loving nation

82719 to apply a blanket ban of disclosure is a matter of wide public concern because it is handled by an agency outside the jurisdiction
82720 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
82721 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
82722 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom
82723 there are increasing pendency of cases in the information commissions the condition has become so bad that if you file an rti today chances are that it will come to hearing two years later we feel that the information which is not provided on time has no meaning
82724 we will focus on collecting data regarding the grievances of the people and will do a public audit of all the judgements of the information commissions during the month of october this year and later do a public hearing of them as well

82730 this memorial is a fitting tribute honouring the 52 lives lost on 7 july 2005 ensuring that the world will never forget them it represents the enormity of our loss both on a personal and public level
82731 we hope this memorial will speak to visitors so they can understand the impact of these horrific events we would like to thank the department for
82732 using the language of architecture to make order out of chaos this monument is an opportunity for lost victims to be in contact with the living through a process of discovery where the memorials structure becomes complete through the presence and body language of a curious visitor
82733 we have one wish it is to make the beijing olympic games a global sports gathering a success
82734 oh tibetans want to be independent and they are very violent they use violence in lhasa and some tibetans rob the torch in paris and in london so that makes the chinese people hate tibetans so its very terrible
82735 we just want to hold an olympic games its very peaceful and it means friendship it means peace so why dont you let us hold the olympic games peacefully
82736 oh you want to help us not only to fight us not only to suppress us
82737 i dont want to be independent from china i just want the genuine autonomous region
82738 that may be some experts suggest because the students whose families can afford to send them abroad are the ones who have benefited the most from chinas economic liberalization
82739 and the reporter said tibetans have not received benefits from chinas development
82740 if the chinese government announced the number of people who are affected by hiv aids maybe 10 000 could you write down another number
82741 the rumours which began in england about her health are dramatic overstated and untrue her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly
82742 at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
82743 we have a damn tough job in front of us as any olympic person that wants to shoot for a medal has but i think theres definitely opportunities there for some medals

82767 the song was inspired by thinking that there is a lot of pain in the world it is ironic that so many challenges come from our beliefs yet most philosophies have a supreme being the equivalence of god allah jehovah yahweh amlak the one the divine and many others what we have in common is that god belongs to all of us

82775 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women it s a shame that so many women still struggle to receive equal pay for equal work
82776 congress sends a clear message today that this injustice must not stand if the bush administration is truly committed to the principle of equal pay for women they should immediately drop their veto threat and support this historic measure
82777 i want to thank my friends chairman miller and congresswoman delauro for all of their work on this issue
82778 we have to remember that the paycheck fairness act is about a lot more than fixing a couple of loopholes in a law that passed decades ago it s about strengthening families combating poverty and finally recognizing that equal work deserves equal pay

82795 today s students face daunting obstacles on the path to college from skyrocketing tuition prices to predatory student lending tactics this landmark bipartisan legislation will address these challenges and create a higher education system that is more consumer friendly fairer and easier to navigate
82796 already this congress has taken historic steps to make college more affordable and accessible with today s vote we are saying that in our nation s higher education programs the needs of students and families must always come first
82797 this bill is a real victory for college students and their families it puts quality information in the hands of consumers and takes meaningful steps to hold down the college cost increases that are threatening students ability to pursue their higher education dreams
82798 i applaud today s bipartisan vote and look forward to this bill s swift enactment
82799 this bill is crucial to the health of our economy and will ensure that more students graduate prepared for the 21st century workplace
82800 it puts smart strategies in place to improve our student aid process restore confidence in our student loan programs and provide more low income first generation and minority students the chance to pursue a college education
82801 i am thrilled at the passage of the higher education opportunity act the first reauthorization of the higher education act in 10 years this important legislation will allow our nations students year round pell grants it also includes my legislation to curb wasteful spending by closing a loophole that allowed convicted child predators to receive federal financial aid to take college courses so today the most wasteful spending program in america comes to an end
82802 i m so stressed because i m the only one who can do my job
82803 when i made the hard decision to forgo buying a house in dallas i knew i was gonna get it
82804 the thing is i really wanted to live in dallas but we just couldnt do it so we chose plano
82805 once we pulled the trigger the judgments came a flyin
82806 i was scolded that my daughter by being in a plano school would be sheltered from nay ill equipped for life in the real world
82807 well yeah probably the real world is a lot bigger than dallas bigger than texas and bigger than the united states the majority of the real world is dirty violent poor and absent indoor plumbing and two ply toilet paper more than half the worlds people live on something like 1 a day
82808 i dont think attending woodrow wilson high equips you any better for that kind of outdoorsy back to nature lifestyle than plano west but i admit i dont know much about woodrows elective courses
82809 i was also told most oddly that by subjecting my kid to suburban life and suburban schools shed get no exposure to people from other cultures
82810 seriously if the only exposure to other people your kid gets is when shes sitting in a place where you move about like cattle at the sound of a bell and have to ask permission to go to the bathroom i e school what kind of sheltered life are you giving your kid
82811 look diversity is great when it comes to nightclubs workplaces cultural experiences restaurants and all that but i dont want diversity in my neighborhood
82812 now put down the pitchfork i dont mean the superficial diversity of skin color i mean diversity of values thats what i dont want in my neighborhood or my neighborhood school
82813 i want uniformly boring neighbors with uniformly boring middle class values who spend saturdays working on their lawns and whose kids know to stay off mine i want neighbors with home depot on speed dial thats how i choose to live your mileage may vary and isnt that diversity too
82814 the coming population crisis in america and what you can do about it
82815 america needs to awake up from the apathy during this period all of your so called friends and enemies dont show their real face but are getting ready to act after the elections
82816 we are in a most sensitive period which might bring about a different balance of powers and cost millions of deaths if iran does not immediately stop its preparation for ballistic long range nuclear weapons
82817 if our strength in military power and decisive actions worldwide stops getting stronger and stronger if we dont keep our best allies who are tested worldwide with us if we turn to a european model of society then we will be paralyzed from the strikes of the unions the huge government and the leisure that the left wing is promising to the non productive but demanding individuals
82818 actually all americans should be united and continue the mission given to america by god which is to safe keep the world from disorder until we reach the point to be united in peace understanding and security respect of the humanity the nature and love without limits development and prosperity for all with justice
82819 i would propose that we rather need a government of national unity a bipartisan one to deal with the huge problems we face and then go for elections
82820 america awake before it is too late go back to the ideals and strengths of your founding fathers and dont change face because god will turn his face away from you and you will be destroyed

82851 he was crouched down ready to pounce on me and he was scaring me he jumped up and grabbed me by my face and grabbed my nose and bit it off

82854 an incident room will open under detectives from the homicide and serious crime command
82855 at this early stage we must retain an open mind re the circumstances and motive but it appears there was an incident in the street with a man who subsequently made off on foot
82856 witnesses or anyone with information are asked to call crimestoppers on 0800 555 111
82857 dr yarbrough does a nice job consolidating just about all the information an overwhelmed first year medical student would need to know in a well organized and easy to read handbook it could also be worthwhile reading for a parent or spouse of a student in order to give them insight into what their family member is embarking on and investing in for the next four years
82858 i believe that dr yarbroughs the student doctor network caribbean medical school primer is an excellent book and will be of great benefit to prospective medical students to caribbean medical schools this book does not only prepare students for living in the caribbean and attending school in a foreign environment it also highlights facts about the u s medical degree and practice in general
82859 miss spears reluctantly agreed that we extend the temporary letters
82860 banks led the walkout because they are dissatisfied that the charter dispute on broad based black bbbee ownership has not yet been resolved
82861 the council had also agreed about 6 months ago to allow government national treasury and labour and community constituencies to engage in order to try and resolve the ownership issue
82862 trade associations took the view at yesterdays meeting that we have gone as far as we can on discussions on a sector code and we need to resolve the ownership issue before completing discussions on this
82863 there was no report on any progress on the ownership issue to the meeting yesterday
82864 it is clear from the above that we have not boycotted any negotiation process
82865 we remain committed to the charter and are keen to see it gazetted as a sector code the results demonstrated by our members against the charter scorecard in the last 3 years are testimony to our commitment and demonstrates concrete delivery on our part it is thus ludicrous to infer that we are anti transformation

82883 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in
82884 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
82885 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position and if he was a woman he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept

82906 iraq will be in hell and we will find ourselves at the gates of civil war
82907 the american presence in iraq is the safety valve to keep this country quiet if they withdraw that will lead to calamity
82908 the u s presence in iraq is useful now but if the security situation gets better i think its not necessary to keep all these big numbers of soldiers here
82909 i think that obama talks more than what he can accomplish because reality differs from promises and dreams
82910 i think it is just a camouflage to reach the presidential chair its a way to satisfy the american people and the american mothers
82911 the proposal of obama to pull out the troops by summer 2010 is foolish if the united states withdraws from iraq i think its credibility among the international countries would collapse
82912 we need more training as well as new and developed weapons and supplies we also need modern and developed technology the u s forces should withdraw gradually so our iraqi forces can fill the gaps that the american forces will leave
82913 as to a timetable i dont think we should specify it now because it is related to the logistical support and the ability of our iraqi forces to handle their responsibility
82914 there are inherent limits to refugee processing capacity in the region that would not accommodate the substantially higher resettlement numbers you are proposing
82915 most of these have left or are in the process of leaving the country and face an urgent need of assistance and protection as their resources run out
82916 we see real potential to resettle iraqis associated with the united states through our nascent in country program
82917 formidable logistical and security challenges must be overcome in baghdad
82918 setting up a government that is working for the people
82919 if were going to crow about the fact that 12 million iraqis voted and elected their own leadership we have to pay attention to their leadership
82920 we cant have it both ways we should say were heading for the door
82921 i find it interesting that prime minister maliki is now the person to go to
82922 there are some members who feel because of what is happening out there a little hung out to dry
82923 senator barack obama arrived in baghdad on monday meeting with prime minister maliki and other senior iraqi politicians as an iraqi spokesman said that the government was hopeful that foreign combat troops would withdraw in 2010
82924 sen barack obama received a fresh boost monday to his troop withdrawal plan from the iraqi government which directly affirmed for the first time that it shares obamas goal of pulling u s troops out of iraq by the end of 2010
82925 republican sen john mccain on monday drew closer to his democratic presidential opponents timetable on iraq saying that u s troops could be largely withdrawn in two years
82926 the iraqis have been sending signals for months they didnt want long term u s bases they didnt want u s troops acting independently any more they wanted some sort of drawdown
82927 in iraq it means that maliki now feels confident that he is in charge of the government and that the governments internal opposition the sunni insurgent remnants and the followers of muqtada al sadr dont have the strength to threaten him or his kurdish and hakim family allies
82928 senator mccain has always said that withdrawal has to be based on conditions on the ground and the judgment of military commanders
82929 theres not as much disagreement there as i think people may perceive
82930 the resources they consider necessary to carry out their mission
82931 no amount of additional u s forces can affect the outcome
82932 john mccains essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops
82933 hes made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of bushs decision to send more troops in
82934 senator obama doesnt understand he doesnt understand whats at stake here
82935 he chose to take the political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party
82936 if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and a reduction in the violence
82937 i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced
82938 and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform
82939 if we wait until the next administration it could be a year before we get those additional troops on the ground here in afghanistan and i think that would be a mistake
82940 i think the situation is getting urgent enough that weve got to start doing something now
82941 our message to the afghan government is this we want a strong partnership based on more for more more resources from the united states and nato and more action from the afghan government to improve the lives of the afghan people
82942 the discussions focused on the significant progress that weve made but also on the unmet challenges we still have ahead of us
82943 the discussions also focused on the difficulties were facing the difficult challenges of the fight against corruption counternarcotics and also the continuing threat of terrorism and fundamentalism not just threatening the way of life in afghanistan but also in the region
82944 losing is not an option when it comes to al qaeda and it never has been
82945 and thats why the fact that we engaged in a war of choice when we were not yet finished with that task was such a mistake
82946 japanese stocks apparently have lost their appeal despite their depressed price levels
82947 a mere cabinet reshuffle is unlikely to be effective in breaking the current political impasse
82948 the employment data are unlikely to become a positive factor for stocks given the large increase in last weeks jobless claims

82982 those involved in mineral exploration and mining projects particularly in western australia are subject to an already burdensome approvals process
82983 adding more red tape by applying national heritage status to such a vast area would be the last straw for many companies who would consider moving their investments to other jurisdictions
82984 this would result in fewer discoveries and the benefits of the resources boom would come to an end when current mining projects were exhausted
82985 while we endorse specific sites of outstanding heritage value being considered a grab bag approach suggests a lack of research and understanding of heritage listings and by implication the contributions that others such as miners and pastoralists make to the economic viability and ultimately heritage of regional areas
82986 the negative outlook reflects both the potential impact of weaker credit conditions in nabs core geographies as well as ongoing dislocations in credit markets
82987 the ratings outlook is reflecting trends that may affect a rating over the next 12 months

82989 australian banks on average have one of the very highest ratings around the world
82990 there are very few banks globally that would be aaa that would not be government related
82991 as we indicated national australia bank is coming up toward the weak end of its ratings range in a number of categories
82992 were obviously expecting that other banks will make provisions as they come up to their reporting season given that there have been a number of impaired accounts that have been highlighted and delinquencies in the consumer sector seem to be picking up slowly

83005 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
83006 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
83007 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
83008 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
83009 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
83010 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
83011 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
83012 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

83014 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
83015 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
83016 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream

83025 i was scared i was homeless but didnt want to see it
83026 i was getting crazy because in the first year i was in the shelter nobody would hire me
83027 i didnt talk to anybody i didnt smile and i felt like my life was over i felt like a failure
83028 and why we did not live in our house anymore
83029 she knew she was different and was afraid her classmates would call her a bum
83030 this dramatic increase in the number of new homeless families is the major cause of the growing population of homeless families
83031 and the increase is in large part driven by the growing scarcity of rental housing affordable to low income new yorkers
83032 the waiting list is huge and we dont have enough money to pay for everyone
83033 i got it i got it i was so happy i got the voucher i couldnt believe it
83034 they think people who need help are lazy and wont pay their part of the rent
83035 and if they have had a program user that was not a good tenant they tend to think everybody behaves the same way
83036 they want to live close to their friends from before and have the same life that we used to have

83054 brilliance melded with polish and a touch of gritty focus more magnifying glass than prism a cactus is sharp in many directions but spends its life alone distant and irrelevant a pencil is sharp and to the point and it creates legends delineates logic and brings the beauty of the living world to that of the once living i would dedicate myself to being a pencil but 2b or not 2b that is the question

83062 god delights to do good to others through them that they themselves throught the exercise of faith may obtain an increase of it difficulties limitations hinderances bereavements and losses though we shirk exceedingly from them are the very agencies that god uses to cause us to grow a christian is made strong by adversity
83063 again the increase of faith is dependant upon the individuals attitude toward the method god uses for this purpose instead of wanting no trials before victory and no exercise of patience the child of god must be willing to take these things from his hands as means of expanding his christian life trials difficulties obstacles griefs necessities are all the very food of faith

83082 if the resort shuts down they will not have use of the amenities like the tennis and even things like power
83083 our position is that the general partner has distributed and advanced loans and monies to his affiliated business and partners and that is why they dont have enough cash

83087 inborn errors of metabolism can have many effects including influencing enzyme coenzyme reactions and ultimately brain function ames 2004 has stated that at least one third of all
83088 methylation reactions are of great scientific interest because they represent one interface between nutrients and genetic expression the process of methylation is simple in terms of mechanism it consists of adding a methyl group
83089 although it used to be thought that there was a rigid correspondence between a gene genotype and its effects the phenotype it is now well established that nutrients can alter gene expression in fact some nutrition journals now routinely provide entire issues or sections devoted to nutrient gene interactions
83090 although much of our knowledge of nutrient diseases fits a one nutrient one disease short latency model e g vitamin c and scurvy heaney 2003 proposed that many human chronic diseases cancer cardiovascular disease and
83091 on the one hand perhaps long term nutrient insufficiency results in altered brain development low hippocampal amino acid concentration and subsequent mental symptoms
83092 although interpretation of the generally positive reports summarized herein must be tempered by the knowledge that negative results are less likely to be published it does appear to be the case that some solid scientific research on nutrient mood effects has been published during the past 90 years
83093 given how much research on micronutrients and mood has been published since the 1920s it is possible that the results are being neglected in part because they do not fit established paradigms
83094 he trusted her she deliberately placed him in a position where his defenses were down he was lonely and she and her mossad team took advantage of that i have nothing but contempt for what she did
83095 she was sent on practice missions breaking into an occupied hotel room stealing documents from an office
83096 she was roused from her bed in the dead of night and dispatched on more exercises picking up a tourist in a nightclub then disengaging herself outside his hotel every move she made was observed by her tutors
83097 a woman has skills a man simply does not have the history of modern intelligence is filled with accounts of women who have used their sex for the good of their country
83098 the warnings added to his feelings of discontent and the nuclear issue weighed on his mind
83099 he worried about the monumental destructive power of the weapons he was helping to supply
83100 vanunu was now on a collision course with his fellow countrymen who when they found out would take it for granted that he was deliberately mocking his countrys two most cherished beliefs its religion and national security
83101 these were weapons that could obliterate a major city they had no sensible battlefield application
83102 i was utterly absorbed in the wealth of detail he was able to supply
83103 are you a tourist like me why dont we go for a coffee
83104 this woman might be lying she might be a mossad plant
83105 she is just a tourist who is critical of israel i think you would like her
83106 he should never have been allowed to wander around london on his own
83107 but there was this problem in that he hadnt actually signed the contract and we had no hold on him
83108 is considerably more advanced than indicated by any previous report or conjectures of which i am aware
83109 vanunu m was hi jacked in rome itl 30 9 86 21 000 came to rome by fly ba504
83110 they therefore had to lure mordechai out of the country and do the dirty deed elsewhere
83111 this was a time consuming operation it is probable that cheryl was not the only mossad mata hari lurking around and flashing her eyes in mordes direction it all depended on morde believing he had made the first move
83112 if we began to talk about that they would end the visit
83113 want to lower israels profile but by talking about what they would do to vanunu its a boomerang theyre attracting fire
83114 some people suggested he was trying to protect her maybe he was still in love with her
83115 but at the time he said that he was going bananas and on the verge of insanity
83116 he still says he doesnt think i have the right person theres an element of denial on his part for a time he even entertained the idea that she might be an innocent dupe as well
83117 continues to work for mossad according to her israeli neighbors
83118 she and her husband they believe have rented out their house while she is engaged in an overseas assignment and are expected some day to return
83119 she was burned her identity was revealed and she was too prominent
83120 i think she probably is still doing some stuff for the mossad because once you train someone to do a job like this you dont want to lose them the only satisfaction ive had in 18 years is being able to track her down and expose her identity which means her future career was damaged
83121 indeed she was not able to travel to the united kingdom again in case the british authorities might have tried to arrest her

83138 slowly disrobed herself in the presence of the crowd she next advanced to the water side plunged into the waves and offered sacrifice to poseidon returning like a sea nymph drying her hair from which the water dripped over her exquisite limbs she paused for a moment before the crowd which shouted in a phrensy of enthusiasm as the fair priestess vanished into a cell in the temple
83139 if there is anyone who holds the opinion that young men should be interdicted from intrigues with the women of the town he is indeed austere
83140 when flora through the practice of prostitution had come into great wealth she made the people her heir and bequeathed a certain fund the income of which was to be used to celebrate her birthday by the exhibition of the games they call the floralia
83141 they were solemnized with every form of licentiousness for in addition to the freedom of speech that pours forth every obscenity the prostitutes at the importunities of the rabble strip off their clothing and act as mimes in full view of the crowd and this they continue until full satiety comes to the shameless lookers on holding their attention with their wriggling buttocks
83142 there is no question that most of the women there are trafficked
83143 as early as egypt i found out that i was going to engage in prostitution in eilat
83144 i tried to run away but a bedouin got hold of me and beat me in the evening four bedouin raped me one after the other i was bleeding and i couldnt walk it hurt me so much between my legs i wanted to die
83145 the woman is made to stand naked in the middle of a room
83146 although i had a very hard childhood in romania im very grateful for it now
83147 i started to say to myself something is really wrong with this country on this issue
83148 it was easier to just pretend that these women were new immigrants from the fsu and were not being trafficked into israel
83149 today one of the central elements of the war against organized crime is trafficking in women
83150 i would sit there wearing thin pantyhose and freezing in the air conditioning
83151 laughing was not allowed because the client might think he was being made fun of and leave
83152 yuri told me that he had bought me for a lot of money and i had to do what he said to do prostitution
83153 thats how i realized that i had been sold like an animal
83154 the meetings with the clients were short just 15 minutes
83155 they beat you so as not to leave any marks because clients dont like to see a woman with bruises
83156 the russian mob knows exactly how to get to their families
83157 it is enough for them to say to the prostitutes if you dont want to see your grandmothers house burned down or your 12 year old sister taken as a prostitute you better do what we tell you
83158 an international network of criminal organizations most of whose members are from the countries of the former soviet union
83159 the russians do quality work in crime thats russian education for you
83160 one sasha recruits them in moldova another sasha is waiting for them in egypt another meets them when they arrive in israel its organized perfectly
83161 when we try to convince them to go to the police to complain about the brothels operating in their neighborhood they say what are you joking the traffickers will kill me there is a lot of fear in israel of the russian mob
83162 in tel aviv the police understand what is going on
83163 its a different story they couldnt care less and they dont see trafficking as a serious crime they think these women really enjoy what theyre doing
83164 in the beginning we had to sue for every victim it was hard but after two or three cases they mess with them
83165 without a doubt there exists collaboration between the police and the pimps
83166 they are traded and sold from one trafficker to another like a piece of merchandise
83167 so she said to him in romanian leave me alone and he replied in romanian so they started talking he made her take his cell phone number because he thought something was wrong she said that everything was okay
83168 if you told her a joke and made her smile thats enough for me
83169 there are approximately 40 women staying in the hotel waiting to testify
83170 she was told by a gynecologist that she would never be able to have a child but now she has a son
83171 we only did it so that my parents wouldnt say they had a prostitute in the family
83172 i have nothing to fear no diseases good money and sometimes i actually get as excited as the client does
83173 she was sent on practice missions breaking into an occupied hotel room stealing documents from an office
83174 she was roused from her bed in the dead of night and dispatched on more exercises picking up a tourist in a nightclub then disengaging herself outside his hotel every move she made was observed by her tutors
83175 she is just a tourist who is critical of israel i think you would like her
83176 for me this is a black story and i just want to erase it and forget it
83177 along the way raped beaten and then sold in public auctions
83178 the prevailing attitude was to treat the women as illegal residents
83179 it was a bump and grind is as old as mankind
83180 diese personen besitzen genetische marker die eigentlich als vorwarnzeichen f r ernste erkrankungen wie herz und gef probleme schlaganf lle oder diabetes gelten doch sie werden einfach nicht krank

83193 der sachverst ndige ist zu dem schluss gekommen dass ein schicksalhaftes geschehen vorliegt es ist zu komplikationen gekommen die leider nicht zu verhindern waren
83194 ungeachtet dessen sind zwei stunden vergangen wo die mutter des patienten im aufnahmebereich miterleben konnte dass dieselben symptome wie damals sowie auch atemnot vorherrschten und ihrerseits fruchtlos st ndig auf den verdacht eines herzinfarkts hingewiesen wurde
83195 trotz eindeutiger symptome und ausdr cklicher hinweise regelrecht stunden vergangen ohne die symptome richtig zu deuten
83196 zum zeitpunkt des eintreffens dieses befundes war der patient bereits klinisch tot
83197 es haben jedoch die spezifischen befunde gefehlt die das eindeutig best tigt h tten

83228 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
83229 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
83230 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
83231 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
83232 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed
83233 checking the displaced persons department tired me out and made me avoid it altogether

83249 we were unhappy with shoaibs unprofessionalism he had promised us a lot of things but ultimately did not live up to our expectations we have been waiting for eight months for shoaib but there is no response from his side yet it is very upsetting although everybody had cautioned us about shoaib his behaviour still came as a rude shock it was like a reality check we are in the process of getting the rest of the cast in place the film will go on the floors very soon

83265 nothing went wrong they were all people with disabilities and we employed twice as many people as we needed to employ if they were able bodied people so we struck a good rate to pay them
83266 say it takes a normal person two minutes to do a task and a person with a disability four minutes then they are 50 per cent down on their ability and we only have to pay 50 per cent of that particular wage
83267 there is a process in the nsw industrial relations commission where an employer can make application to the commission for a disability wage to apply but the position has to be assessed and the work has to be assessed

83317 i dont like to see the game get stopped because of something like that
83318 i cant control it what am i going to do but my reaction out there led to something and i dont like it i felt bad
83319 i think the umpires did a good job taking control of the situation i wasnt worried about hats but i saw a couple balls flying on to the field and thought it was a dangerous situation
83320 there were some things we dont want to see people throwing things on the field all that kind of stuff
83321 it almost cost us the game it was good that it stopped but everyone was on their feet yelling and cheering it kind of sparked us
83322 if this is how fun its going to be we have a lot to look forward to
83323 i walked to the field like six times and all six times i was wrong
83324 bullpen makes a good manager and today i was pretty bad i was making the wrong decision every time i went to the field
83325 i dont want to get myself in trouble but its just one of those things ive never been a part of
83326 it was a little disappointing to be out there with a 1 2 count on a guy and to have to come and sit but im not going to use it as an excuse i ended up walking him
83327 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
83328 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection
83329 its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit
83330 until now there hasnt been a reliable way to tell if somebody a hacker an isp corporate firewall or the great firewall of china is modifying your internet traffic en route
83331 the few tests available have been for narrow and specific kinds of interference or have required tremendous amounts of advanced forensic labor switzerland is designed to make general purpose isp testing faster and easier
83332 wir sind ganz normale leute nur eben mit einem intelligenzquotienten ber 130 es ist aber nicht so dass hier lauter kleine einsteins rumlaufen
83333 ich bin auf der suche nach intelligenten gespr chen und erfrischungen f r den kopf es ist selten so dass wir generell f r alles begabt sind sondern wir sind bei bestimmten themen besonders schnell und kommen auch besser in komplexe themen rein
83334 ein iq ber 130 ist kein garant f r ein erfolgreiches leben vorteile ergeben sich nur wenn man lernt seine besondere begabung richtig einzusetzen
83335 als autistin und hochbegabte war ich lange verzweifelt f hlte mich als kind und jugendliche abgelehnt und kam mir berall wie ein fremdk rper vor
83336 ich habe ein fotografisches ged chtnis f r details und schreibe leidenschaftlich gern
83337 w hrend meines pharmaziestudiums habe ich angefangen bundesweit vortr ge ber hochbegabung und den richtigen umgang mit hochintelligenten kindern zu halten vor allem f r lehrer denn die haben bei mir fr her vieles falsch gemacht
83338 es war alles so leicht in der ersten klasse vor allem in mathe
83339 netzwerke aufbauen kontakte bis in die kleinsten d rfer hinein herstellen
83340 viele f hlen sich irgendwie anders und unverstanden wissen aber nichts von ihrer hochbegabung
83341 wir bieten in einer sehr konzentrierten form eine geballte menge an wissen an entsprechend der schnellen auffassungsgabe der hochintelligenten
83342 eine nebenwirkung der hochbegabung ist ja dass wir sehr schnell denken und erkl ren und uns dann wundern dass unser gegen ber uns nicht versteht
83343 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
83344 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
83345 we will give them notice prior to going to the proper process to get it into their hands
83346 they were returned to us after they were not used from different areas mississippi louisiana
83347 how can people ask for something they dont know exists
83348 if they have bona fide need its their responsibility to pass that need on
83349 if the fire department operated the same way fema does we would have to call the fire department and specifically request the hose the pressurized water the truck the firefighters and the ladder all before fema would acknowledge that they should send this equipment to help
83350 according to federal management regulations we cannot give away anything
83351 we had to use the established federal process to dispose or excess these supplies

83353 american drivers are counting on congress to lift the ban and so are american workers
83354 the low approval rating for democratic leaders in congress is not likely to put the partys control of congress in jeopardy
83355 there is no indication in any poll taken by any organization that voters want to see the gop regain control of congress and all generic ballot questions show a wide lead for democratic congressional candidates
83356 ever since ive played and when ive coached ive never worried about my next job ive worried about the job i have
83357 my feeling is if you do a good job at the job you have the next job will come itll take care of itself
83358 i think everybodys goal is to get to the nhl and you know ive never been one to rush things because the way ive looked at it every year ive been here ive learned something new its been dramatic its been something that you look back on and say if i didnt have the opportunity to do what weve been doing for the last three years i wouldnt be near the coach that i am now having said that if my next opportunity doesnt come for two years or five years then therell be some good that comes out of that and if it comes next year then thatll be good too
83359 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there
83360 his performance during this years trade deadline became its own tribe in brazil
83361 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
83362 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
83363 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of

83365 want to know what sports blogging can look like when its in the hands of a real journalist
83366 the years most outrageous statement opec president says 40 of the oil price increase is due to biofuels
83367 they say we live in an information age but where energy is concerned its more like a disinformation age thanks in no small measure to the money and clout wielded by opec a cartel whose sole interest is to preserve petroleums near monopoly of the transportation fuel market and to keep the price of oil as high as possible
83368 in 2005 the u s was home to 81 ethanol plants according to ethanol trade group the renewable fuels association once the energy bill was enacted construction took off by january 2006 the number of ethanol production facilities had grown to 95 by the start of 2007 110 refineries were online with another 73 under construction and today there are 139 in the u s and at least 60 under construction
83369 ethanol use particularly with the lack of additional refinieries something enviromentalists also oppose has created huge supply line problems for america
83370 only something akin to journalistic malpractice could have kept them from reporting all the facts
83371 any increase in fuel affects everyone right across society increasing both households and business costs my priority is to ensure that those who most need help with rising energy costs get that support from the government
83372 there are so many people who were being helped i had an opportunity to translate to help people with limited finances help pay rent or some of their bills to stop from being thrown out of their apartments
83373 it is something that really benefited a lot of people and not just poor people some people were in 350 000 half million dollar homes they lost their jobs they had to choose between buying food and paying a bill
83374 it shows children that they can get along in unity
83375 i was legally blind i could only see shadows god in his ultimate goodness restored sight in one eye and now i can drive
83376 he wasnt waving banners i dont want to use my military service to benefit myself i was so humbled before him
83377 faith is important to me because it encompasses everything we do every day by the grace of god
83378 if there was something over the years you saw and would like to ask for it will all be sorted on a first asked basis
83379 i cant imagine the fear you feel at having to go back to iraq i wish i could stop everything and that you wouldnt have to go unfortunately i am not that powerful
83380 that he isnt the only young person to face being sent back to iraq but there is something in this memo
83381 fear hits you in your stomach it gets hard to breathe and the tears flow i dont know how to respond to this memo i want to hold him and tell him that everything will be all right but i dont know if this will be true why cant this stupid useless war end
83382 the information i have about going back to iraq is not for public release
83383 that is why i could not go into detail on a mass e mail i guess the reason for the low optimism is a few reasons
83384 we will be going to a very bad spot our mission will be to conduct patrols along the iraq iran border at this time there is a high amount of insurgent activity in that area
83385 is a complete dipstick he is a me first type of fellow and does not care what it takes to make himself look good
83386 not sure what to do other than to move forward one day at a time ill keep you posted
83387 im worried that if you go with the belief that something bad will happen it could
83388 right now i want to tell you how much i love you i want to make everything better but i cant please know that if you must go back to iraq i will do everything i can
83389 i will write letters to politicians or whatever it takes
83390 yes i have a request i want you to come back safe and sound so you have to promise me that you will do everything possible to get back

83394 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
83395 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
83396 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
83397 fuck man this is the greatest thing since man created vsh porn
83398 i have to accept that i appear to be the fall guy and may be the fall guy
83399 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
83400 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc it may have taken into consideration new circumstances in this year leading up to the games where there has been quite a lot of trauma around china and within china
83401 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
83402 having understood yesterday that there were difficulties with access to some sites which obviously goes against our desire to always have media having access they need we understand that the organizers tomorrow will confirm how they have remedied the situation
83403 its important to stress that there has not at any stage been a deal where the ioc has entered into an agreement with china to censor the internet there has been no deal with china to censor the internet
83404 some of our guys have inherent breathing issues and to put them in this environment its worrisome for sure
83405 every athlete the clean ones and the not clean ones should clearly know that we mean business
83406 the ioc will do everything that is humanly possible to have the cleanest possible games
83407 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
83408 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
83409 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
83410 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
83411 im not reading that but it was interesting and i really fell in love with the characters
83412 now i am wanting to venture out and read more

83416 so hungover from clubbing with my gays i want to call her maggie winehouse or rather
83417 if you have even one balled up kleenex in your pocket im gonna take you to the home today shady pines
83418 she got a new bra her first one in 17 years and we all had to hear about it
83419 i hate all those guys im so much funnier than they are theyll see what im gonna do is ill be funnier than anybody can be if not ill just swear a lot like a boy then ill buy things and more things ill make them pay ill make them all pay uhhh goodnight jesus
83420 chinas door will always be open during and after the olympics we welcome foreign journalists and will facilitate them in the future
83421 but all foreign journalists should abide by chinese rules and regulations and be fair in their reporting on china so we can have good communications with the rest of the world
83422 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
83423 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world

83428 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
83429 and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns

83440 die aufregung um seinen m glichen parteiausschluss schadet eher der spd
83441 die spd tut sich damit berhaupt keinen gefallen weil wolfgang clement f r eine bestimmte politische richtung in der spd steht

83474 theyre marketing their services to not only foreign governments but to fortune 500 corporations
83475 this is a company that has been accused of murdering iraqi civilians
83476 of shooting the bodyguard to the iraqi vice president of causing blowback attacks on united states troops of hurting the morale of the united states military that has cost united states taxpayers over a billion dollars for its operations in iraq
83477 a private cia essentially called total intelligence solutions and the man running total intelligence solutions is j cofer black hes a thirty year veteran of the central intelligence agency he also was the guy who ran the cias extraordinary rendition program the government sanctioned kidnap and torture program
83478 his thirty year cia career his network of contacts his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the united states government is now on the open market for hire
83479 you have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the united states armed forces this has everything to do with the future of war making and global stability

83485 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
83486 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
83487 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
83488 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
83489 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
83490 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
83491 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
83492 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
83493 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
83494 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
83495 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
83496 it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy
83497 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
83498 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
83499 clearly it was meant to suggest that he is not white hence a reference to race
83500 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
83501 obama used the race card against the clintons with great success now hes trying it with mccain
83502 voting for bho will not absolve aerican sic american of its racist sins past prejudices nor redeem the nation
83503 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
83504 might i remind you that its cost 1 25 cents to make 1 00 of ethanol

83517 whoa whoa whoa there sir you promised youd never say that word again or at least for the next 7 years

83539 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
83540 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
83541 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

83603 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
83604 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
83605 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
83606 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
83607 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
83608 you have value on the ground more than you spent
83609 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
83610 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
83611 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
83612 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
83613 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
83614 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
83615 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
83616 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
83617 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant

83620 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
83621 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
83622 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
83623 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
83624 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
83625 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
83626 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
83627 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
83628 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
83629 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
83630 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something

83714 the summer of 1968 is a record of gods hottest hour
83715 the memories are not forgotten they are painful they inhabit the whirlwind where gods wrath dwells in 1968 something terrible happened in the church within the ministerial priesthood ruptures developed everywhere among friends which never healed and the wounds continue to affect the whole church the dissent together with the leaders manipulation of the anger they fomented became a supreme test it changed fundamental relationships within the church
83716 abusive coercive dissent has become a reality in the church and subjects her to violent debilitating unproductive chronic controversies
83717 diocesan presbyterates have not recovered from the july august nights in 1968
83718 the violence of the initial disobedience was only a prelude to further and more pervasive violence
83719 priests wept at meetings over the manipulation of their brothers contempt for the truth whether aggressive or passive has become common in church life dissenting priests theologians and laypeople have continued their coercive techniques from the beginning the press has used them to further its own serpentine agenda

83725 a frenchman with the french a huron with the hurons an algonquin with the algonquins but that which apparently predominated was a devotion altogether rare and singular to the blessed virgin and particularly toward the mystery of her immaculate conception all his conversations and letters contained something about the blessed virgin immaculate for so he always called her so tender a devotion toward the mother of god merited some singular grace and she accorded him the favor that he had always requested to die on a saturday his companions never doubted that she appeared to him at the hour of his death when after pronouncing the names of jesus and mary he suddenly raised his eyes above his crucifix holding them fixed on an object which he regarded with extreme pleasure and a joy that showed itself upon his features and they had at that time the impression that he had rendered up his soul into the hands of his good mother
83726 the problems looming on the horizon are complex and time is short
83727 the emerging countries are hungry for energy but at times this hunger is met in a way harmful to poor countries which due to their insufficient infrastructures including their technological infrastructures are forced to undersell the energy resources they do possess at times their very political freedom is compromised by forms of protectorate or in any case by forms of conditioning which appear clearly humiliating

83747 what the myth of rights offers is an integrated set of assertions about the nature and workings of american politics intimately linked to legal processes and firmly rooted in cherished values
83748 we believe that politics is and should be conducted in accordance with patterns of rights and obligations established under law the principal institutional mechanism of the myth of rights is litigation
83749 that litigation can evoke a declaration of rights from courts
83750 can be used to assure the realization of these rights
83751 a more complex framework which takes into account the contingent character of rights in the american system
83752 litigation can politicize individual discontents and in so doing activate a constituency thus lending initial impetus to a movement for change
83753 should not have this system thrust upon them by the courts expansion of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment
83754 constitutional values usually define the boundaries of judicial independence courts are unlikely to take the lead on behalf of goals that are not firmly rooted in constitutional values
83755 nothing in the language of the due process clause itself requires the state to protect the life liberty and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors
83756 purpose was to protect the people from the state not to ensure that the state protected them from each other
83757 judges tend to be tied to the procedural absolutes which are bound up on a regime of rules with its attendant emphasis on vindicating rights and enforcing obligations

83782 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the us
83783 the danger is not that modernization will be sacrificed to fund asymmetric capabilities but rather that in the future we will again neglect the latter
83784 retreat from openness and democracy could have significant security implications for the united states
83785 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
83786 this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring us strategic advantages
83787 at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
83788 to bully its neighbors all of which are cause for concern
83789 all of these actions suggest a russia exploring renewed influence and seeking a greater international role
83790 will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
83791 mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
83792 help shrink the ungoverned areas of the world and thereby deny extremists and other hostile parties sanctuary
83793 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
83794 if there is very unfavorable weather and the air quality is forecast to not be up to standard for the next 48 hours
83795 we expected that with the odd and even restrictions there would be no traffic jams and therefore fewer pollutants emitted but because of the special olympic driving lane there are still a few traffic jams so the emissions are higher than our predictions
83796 the hazy days we had last week were due to unfavorable weather conditions
83797 if theres no unfavorable weather i think we can guarantee good air quality during the games
83798 being able to drive is an important part of ordinary peoples quality of life if they expand the restrictions it will be even more inconvenient
83799 government policy should be fair to everyone not injure some groups in favor of others i suspect all these measures are only for the olympics just to please the foreigners since they will end on september 20
83800 beijing is always polluted they should come up with a long term solution
83801 some say we should adjust the way we use the olympic lane others say we should spray the streets with water still others say we should do more propaganda to get more people to take public transportation
83802 some experts say maybe we should adjust the opening hours of gas stations
83803 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why

83822 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
83823 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
83824 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
83825 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
83826 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
83827 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
83828 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
83829 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
83830 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
83831 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
83832 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
83833 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
83834 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare

83849 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
83850 im disappointed that obama would say the things hes saying
83851 is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the american people
83852 the most negative abhorrent nasty vicious comment made in this race was the insinuation by barack obama that john mccain was going to run a racist campaign
83853 the mccain campaign will not stand for it there is no evidence of it its not true and we will rebut it
83854 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
83855 but he does believe theyre using the same low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in the campaign
83856 he learned a lot in south carolina in 2000 apparently not all of it good
83857 what they did to mccain in 2000 is what mccains trying to do to barack obama in 2008
83858 the injection of this issue into this race was done by the obama campaign we responded to it
83859 but recently especially last week with obama in europe it seemed like there were a lot of campaign ads you put out that were doing that
83860 and the one yesterday comparing him to paris hilton and britney i was like ok it seems to americans like me you may have flip flopped
83861 im proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have been trying to address to the american people

83866 in sydney my first olympics it was one huge learning experience i took everything in like a sponge everything was new so i was excited about everything the food the bus rides even the toilets
83867 everything was something amazing and we also did well in the competition so i have nothing but positives from my first olympic experience
83868 in athens we had expectations there was a comparison from my first time
83869 plus we were losing more than we should have we had a harder pool we had expectations so it was harder to enjoy i personally had a really bad olympic experience the second time around i wanted a medal and thats all i could think about we didnt leave with a medal so i am not happy i still have a pretty bitter taste in my mouth
83870 we just came out and fought for every single point
83871 were treating every point from here on out like its the last point because it could have been our last points tonight and we know that
83872 but i would like her to become even better to help us achieve our goal
83873 with most of the brazilians in tears from losing their semifinal the usa thought they had a mental edge over the south americans some of the usamericans had been spotted sobbing after their semifinal defeat namely stacy sykora and to a lesser extent logan tom but when it was time for the bronze medal match the usa was overpowered by the brazilians who won their second consecutive bronze medal the brazilians looked really happy in the photos but how happy could they really have been by ending up in the same place four years later not better not worse but the same
83874 as for the usa they ended up in a most respectable fourth place with danielle scott figuring as the tournaments best blocker
83875 and you my father there on the sad height curse bless me now with your fierce tears i pray do not go gentle into that good night rage rage against the dying of the light
83876 article this evening it will be the first of many from not just eric but many others as well this is just one of many plans we are formulating to bring to the community
83877 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
83878 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
83879 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
83880 in one case we heard of a man bringing in a brazilian pornographic photo and saying make my girlfriend look like this
83881 we dont think it is ethical behaviour to agree to do that
83882 it is often not clear where the g spot is or if it even exists at all in some women
83883 so the procedure is done without that being verified often causing problems in sex
83884 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
83885 i never took the time to know him but he seemed to be ok right just a kid
83886 he just said he was going to winnipeg going home thats where he was from
83887 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
83888 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
83889 it looked kind of like a scuffle or an argument you know and then somebodys like knife knife run so i was running up the alleyway slapping people telling them to get going move get off the bus i got pushed over some lady got pushed over i was just making sure everybody was ok and we all got off the bus
83890 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
83891 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
83892 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
83893 but i have been especially impressed this week with the comfortable candour with which muslims and christians have clearly stated their own doctrines to one another
83894 it has been good to sit together and build new friendships
83895 in this dialogue we are not discussing doctrines or creeds
83896 we are just trying to find common ground for religions to work together as intended by god
83897 the intention behind the common word is not to foist the theology of one religion upon another or to attempt conversion
83898 es muy f cil decir que los mclaren son los
83899 obviamente ellos han hecho un mejor trabajo en las ltimas dos carreras pero fueron ayudados por condiciones en las que a nosotros no nos va bien antes de las ltimas dos carreras ellos estaban siendo criticados por no tener un buen desempe o pero as es como funciona este deporte por ello el balance puede cambiar r pidamente
83900 a n hay mucho camino por recorrer en el campeonato y s que tenemos un buen equipo que es el l der del campeonato de constructores conmigo y kimi segundo y tercero en el campeonato de pilotos todo est muy apretado y las cosas pueden cambiar r pidamente como un equipo todos estamos al cien por ciento motivados para hacerlo lo mejor posible este fin de semana y de hecho as desde ahora hasta el fin de la temporada s lo hasta entonces sabremos quien hizo el mejor trabajo
83901 comparando los puntos de esta temporada con los mismos del a o pasado podemos ver que estamos en mejor forma as que no necesitamos exagerar la situaci n y cambiar la forma que trabajamos durante una temporada puedes tener d as excelentes y d as malos as que lo importante es estar concentrados en nuestras metas sin poner atenci n a lo que digan los medios sobre nosotros hemos presionado muy fuerte en el desarrollo del auto tratando de traer el mayor n mero de mejor as posibles al auto
83902 por el momento kimi y yo estamos muy cerca en los puntos si m s tarde este a o uno de nosotros tiene muchos m s puntos que el otro entonces tal vez ser tiempo de ver que podemos hacer a n no es el caso as que continuaremos trabajando de la misma manera

83911 me sorprender a si alguien hizo alg n cambio sin al menos informarle a rogge
83912 pero realmente no conozco el detalle s lo s que las reglas sobre la censura cambiaron pero apenas nos anunciaron aqu debe estar relacionado con un acuerdo anterior del que no fui part cipe

84070 wed like one of the smaller teams first of all to give us a better chance of going through and its just going to be fantastic for the club bringing european football to the people of dumfries
84071 if we get through were probably then going to be up against some of the big names and thats what we want
84072 of course its a bit disappointing not to be at palmerston because having these teams in our own backyard and bringing them to dumfries would have been great but you have to be realistic and we couldnt play there because of uefa restrictions
84073 playing at airdrie will allow more people to come to the games and its a very good stadium
84074 so many people came along to be there in our first scottish cup final and im sure there will be plenty wanting to be there for our first european game
84075 i think there will be a lot of interest in our uefa cup campaign not just from people in dumfries but from people across scotland
84076 my impression is that this book would be very useful and approachable to microscopists biologists and to image processing specialists working with them i would suspect a high market potential
84077 the authors propose to write a book with a good balance between theoretical framework and practical applications the authors are certainly qualified for the task in particular dr castlemans expertise and recognition in this arena will likely evoke good contributions from leading experts in the field
84078 i believe there is a large community who will likely find a book like this to be of technical relevance to their work and a good reference the concept of focusing on the image processing applications in microscopy is good and i do think that this will make the resource valuable
84079 it would be very helpful to have a practical guide to digital image processing since much of the material is currently embedded in software program guides available only with the purchase of high end graphics programs or in technical journals not generally read by biologists biochemists and other emerging users of advanced optical imaging techniques

84092 the recommendations issued today endorse the development of a far more transparent credit rating system
84093 specifically these recommendations offer investors greater disclosure of the ratings process itself and spur credit rating agencies to share more fully information they use in determining credit ratings investors ability to better understand the credit rating agency inputs and methodology will allow investors to incorporate ratings appropriately in their own internal risk assessments and investment decision analytics this in turn is a key element of strengthening the securitized credit markets
84094 providing greater disclosure enhanced surveillance and comparable ratings performance metrics the credit rating agencies can help restore the quality of ratings and the perceived integrity of the ratings process this is essential if we are to avoid a continuation or repeat of the global market turmoil of the past year
84095 this is dynamic impactful guidance the 12 recommendations integrate the best thinking of senior expert sifma members worldwide on how to restore trust in credit ratings
84096 in a similar vein in september our joint sifma esf and asf securitization markets task force will issue actionable industry developed recommendations based on independent research and analysis by mckinsey amp company which are designed to help revitalize the securitization and structured credit markets

84148 the second quarter result is primarily influenced by high oil and gas prices our record earnings are also coming as a result of operational focus contributing to high production
84149 our equity production increased 6 from the second quarter of 2007 mainly due to new capacity both on and outside the norwegian continental shelf ncs and higher gas offtake a number of our fields will undergo planned turnarounds in the next quarter in total we are on track to deliver on our 2008 production ambition
84150 we are also satisfied with our exploration results this year in the first half of 2008 we have completed a total of 49 exploration wells out of which 18 have been declared as discoveries for the full year we plan to drill at least 70 wells
84151 this contract is another confirmation that oil companies are continuing to secure capacity early in a buoyant seismic market
84152 we are also delighted that they have decided to use geostreamer as part of next years campaign the high resolution and deep imaging capabilities of the system can offer a very real competitive advantage both in the search for new reserves and in the enhanced production of existing reservoirs
84153 in economically difficult times we can clearly see the benefits of our robust business model and the advantages of our global orientation we have improved our profitability even further
84154 our international gases and engineering business remains stable so we have every reason to be confident about the future we are therefore reaffirming our short term and medium term forecasts we continue to assume that group sales will increase in the current financial year and that earnings will increase at a faster rate than sales by 2010 we are seeking to achieve group operating earnings of more than 3 billion euro we want to achieve a return on capital employed our key performance indicator of at least 13 percent by 2010
84155 the drop in gasoline prices may be reflecting the more than 20 a barrel drop in crude oil prices since the first week of july when they hit a record of 147 a barrel
84156 it often takes a few weeks for retail prices to catch up to whats happening in the markets but that seems to be the case now

84161 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
84162 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
84163 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
84164 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

84535 diversos acontecimientos pol ticos en venezuela presentan un riesgo incrementado de que el gobierno venezolano pueda nacionalizar o alternativamente intervenir en las operaciones de nuestra filial venezolana lo que podr a afectar negativamente nuestras operaciones en venezuela
84536 vender el banco a un banquero venezolano el cual pidi permiso y autorizaci n porque as est en las leyes y yo como jefe de estado digo no

84544 were right back in it weve just got to go hard again in the morning
84545 i was just chuntering it was just an aimless rant i think i went in to see him afterwards and i apologised it was just emotion i went in and shook his hand and were friends again
84546 yorkers are probably a bit under used at times i tried to slip a few in and it seemed coming out of the committee room windows they struggled to see them
84547 i dont think the light was an issue it was the dark windows above the sightscreen it was really just the yorkers
84548 with the amount of movement there still is off the wicket it makes life tough for the batsmen i think there is going to movement throughout the game

84577 the band turned down a us record deal negotiated by chris blackwell island records and didnt play at carnegie hall or tour the usa because four of its members wanted a larger monetary advance
84578 the real reason that shivas band kala broke up was because bradleys records a subsidiary of atv changed their policy towards their artists they no longer wanted bands to make albums and insisted on them being singles pop artists they wanted shiva to wear a glitter suit and when he refused the senior management of atv broke up the band by taking all of the equipment back and canceling their dates it had nothing to do with ego clashes i dont know where this nik got his info from
84579 need to understand how political processes had in fact operated in order to gauge the necessity for remedial legislation
84580 unique ability to address improper partisan influence in the prosecutorial process n o other institution will fill the vacuum if congress is unable to investigate and respond to this evil
84581 n otwithstanding its best efforts the committee has been unable to discover the underlying causes of the forced terminations of the u s attorneys the committee has legitimate reasons to believe that ms mierss testimony can remedy that deficiency there is no evidence that the committee is merely seeking to harass ms miers by calling her to testify
84582 the executives interest in autonomy rests upon a discretited notion of executive power and privilege
84583 his close advisers cannot hold the superior card of absolute immunity presidential autonomy such as it is cannot mean that the executives actions are totally insulated from scrutiny by congress that would eviscerate congresss historical oversight function
84584 not at all persuaded by the reno and bradbury opinions
84585 which are exhaustive efforts of sophisticated legal reasoning bolstered by extensive citation to judicial authority the reno and bradbury olc opinions are for the most part conclusory and recursive
84586 rather than running roughshod over separation of powers principles the court believes that entertaining this case will reinforce them two parties cannot negotiate in good faith when one side asserts legal privileges but insists that they cannot be tested in court in the traditional manner that is true whether the negotiating partners are private firms or the political branches of the federal government accordingly the court will deny the executives motion to dismiss
84587 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity

84594 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
84595 the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
84596 will relieve the burden on our forces and it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
84597 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
84598 in the months ahead the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
84599 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
84600 i understand why the senator would like to have this matter commenced and concluded before the elections and by all indications that is possible
84601 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
84602 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
84603 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
84604 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
84605 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
84606 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
84607 by expressing regret rajinikanth has showed his greatness we no longer oppose the release
84608 it was a mistake i have learnt a big lesson from the people of karnataka what is important is that the mistake is not repeated i will be careful while speaking in future and see that i dont hurt anybody after all im not a politician that is why it happened
84609 i had witnessed for some worst violence caused for public disturbance and loss of public assets those people should be punished
84610 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
84611 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
84612 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
84613 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
84614 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth
84615 dont be afraid of your material or your past be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you be afraid of not getting your writing done
84616 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
84617 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
84618 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
84619 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative
84620 danger stalks two people in the jungles of san torisco in alison kents latest release the perfect stranger likeable characters intense emotion high risk factor and some spicy sex are what ms kent has cooked up for her readers
84621 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
84622 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
84623 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
84624 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
84625 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
84626 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
84627 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
84628 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
84629 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
84630 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
84631 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
84632 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
84633 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
84634 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
84635 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
84636 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
84637 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
84638 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
84639 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
84640 i needed an actress who would look convincing as an intelligent modern and cultured girl of today katrina fitted the bill perfectly she also looks perfectly matched with ranbir not too many of the top leading ladies are compatible with ranbir
84641 katrina is versatile enough to look perfectly matched with salman khan akshay kumar and ranbir i also like her focussed attitude to her career now that she has proved herself successful theres a hunger to prove herself in roles and projects that arent considered katrinas kingdom
84642 not at all she has very powerful dramatic moments in the plot this role would require katrina to put all her skills into the active mode
84643 no one is making multi starrers any more i think
84644 if you get the right incident the american public will support
84645 are we playing high school with you know 5 000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal yeah we are were playing you know whos the first guy to run off the highway with us and iran
84646 nat rlich bin ich entt uscht schlie lich z hlt die leistung der mannschaft

84648 nat rlich muss man ihm auch mal einen fehler zugestehen
84649 jeder torwart hat seinen eigenen stil aber manuel ist auf einem guten weg wenn er mich etwas gefragt hat dann habe ich ihm gerne geholfen aber ich habe ihm nicht dauernd reingeredet jeder torwart muss seinen eigenen weg gehen
84650 ich bin ein ganz anderer torwarttyp ich bin lautst rker und spiele mehr mit
84651 ich unterteile nicht in jung und alt sondern in gut und schlecht
84652 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
84653 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
84654 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
84655 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
84656 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
84657 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive
84658 kind of a rule of thumb is the more cars you control the more powerful you are and so that sort of attitude of kingdom building is part of the problem here

84701 when i was in my twenties i figured something out if you are a weird looking dude which i am and you want to date exclusively beautiful women which i did the key is to pursue beautiful women who are already in relationships lets say you live in omaha and you meet a hot single woman who is actively dating lots of different guys in order to win her affection you have to be more desirable than every other single guy in omaha its you against everybody however lets say you meet a hot woman who is dating kenneth a hardworking nebraskan haberdasher this situation is way way easier now you merely have to be more desirable than kenneth its you against him
84702 this is because the individual who embodies your personal definition of love does not really exist the person is real and the feelings are real but you create the context and context is everything the person who defines your understanding of love is not inherently different than anyone else and theyre often just the person you happen to meet the first time you really really want to love someone but that person still wins they win and you lose because for the rest of your life they will control how you feel about everyone else
84703 what was that an exhibition we need emotional content try again
84704 i said emotional content not anger not try again with me
84705 dont think feel it is like a finger pointing a way to the moon dont concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory
84706 i wasnt seducing them in any real context i was simply eroding their morality we all have our regrets i suppose

84715 but wait you could be on the verge of the greatest years of your entire life
84716 i stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall the exposed places and i stationed the people in families with their swords spears and bows
84717 you will break the bow if you keep it always bent

84734 i really dont know why michelle continues to do this we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men
84735 i think shes a very good person i feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction
84736 she was so good a couple of years ago when she finished second a few times im sure if you put yourself enough times in that position then you can deal with it and i think its how you become better thats how you learn to win
84737 i dont know why youd want to pass up playing in a major especially the british open here at sunningdale
84738 but she goes a different path and thats not the path way that ive taken
84739 hey petty female member of society produced only for reproduction habits and the occasional dusting of the trophy case please take this steamy hot plate and move swiftly down the hall so gods true creations are allowed the top tier of this worlds wonderful pleasantries without your flashy dresses and nostril clogging perfumes

84741 the club is a terrific place with a golden opportunity to raise its standing in the community by adopting more modern policies
84742 unfortunately the clubs board has failed to grasp that and is leading the club down a disastrous path i sincerely hope that the membership realizes what is happening and collectively puts a stop to it before it is too late
84743 i like the golf course remember my comment last week i was using the british open for a warmup to the british senior open should have been the other way round
84744 so now ive warmed up basically ok so now ive got to step up and hopefully i can do that over the next four or five days

84748 he hits the ball really long and i dont so i need to stick to my game plan hit fairways and greens and give myself opportunities to make birdies
84749 if something positive is written about you i guess you can either ignore it or your head can get big
84750 if something is negative about you which happens quite a bit then that can just tick you off and thats not all that good
84751 i have a great relationship in my opinion with the media i feel like ive been treated fairly
84752 but i think you all would be surprised at how little i pay attention
84753 michelle wie opens with 73 right on the cut line after thursdays round
84754 while i truly appreciate the pga extending me an exemption for this years pga championship i have elected to decline in favor of adhering to the professional and personal commitments i made prior to the open championship at royal birkdale
84755 i guess the guys didnt dislike him they were cautious of him he just kind of got a little pushy
84756 when i heard he was kicked off i knew it wasnt the end of it
84757 i dont think a lot of people understand when youre growing up and youre practicing and youre working so hard this is obviously your goal but there are no guarantees
84758 it was crucial to hit fairways so you could lift and clean your ball and place it in a good lie especially when you dont hit it as far as some of the other guys do
84759 it was like the u s open out there the rough was long and the greens were tough i guess thats a good style of golf for me putting a premium on hitting fairways
84760 mens golf coach o d vincent announced to the team that he was unilaterally canceling andrews eligibility to participate in the universitys athletics program immediately and indefinitely andrew and his teammates were shocked andrew had no prior notice of what was about to happen at no time was andrew ever given an opportunity to defend himself instead he was summarily dismissed
84761 andrews suspension would become a permanent cancellation of his athletic eligibility at duke unless every single one of his twelve teammates wrote a letter to o d vincent that o d vincent deemed satisfactory supporting andrews reinstatement to the team and explaining the reasons why

84813 the use of electronic media is arguably superior to providing company information the old way its a better way to provide information to most investors since today it can be presented in interactive format that allows each individual to click through or drill down to the level of detail thats appropriate to him or her the internet has changed a lot since 2000 which was the last time the commission provided comprehensive guidance on this topic the use of the internet and electronic media back then the idea of the web as a social network was still being developed and web sites such as myspace youtube linkedin and facebook didnt even exist the idea of creating a social network where shareholders could meet and exchange views was barely imaginable blogs hadnt really entered the public lexicon and syndication technologies such as atom and rss were still in development
84814 please dont ever completely delete your old blog urls formerly used as blogs are frequently snapped up by p rn sites who catch unsupsecting visitors surfing in on old links from your friends and readers

84822 you can smell that dump all the way from topeka
84823 where we surely could have gotten you bucked off something
84824 i do believe that its not accurate to put one person under the bus because all youve done there is just postponed the next person under the bus
84825 the head scarf issue is not on our agenda now
84826 there was enormous pressure but i was not going to negotiate the livelihood security of indian farmers
84827 the geneva meet is not meant to increase the prosperity of developed countries but reduce the poverty of developing countries
84828 there is no one in india more committed to opening the economy than kamal nath today
84829 he has opened indias trade policy cut custom duties freed imports simplified the rules but on international agricultural trade his boundaries were already set
84830 senator mccain has always said that withdrawal has to be based on conditions on the ground and the judgment of military commanders
84831 theres not as much disagreement there as i think people may perceive
84832 the resources they consider necessary to carry out their mission
84833 no amount of additional u s forces can affect the outcome
84834 john mccains essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops
84835 hes made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of bushs decision to send more troops in
84836 senator obama doesnt understand he doesnt understand whats at stake here
84837 he chose to take the political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party
84838 if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and a reduction in the violence
84839 i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced
84840 and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform
84841 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
84842 is not ideal since it deprives the public of being able to make up its own mind about guilt or innocence
84843 it is to be expected given the nature of the proceedings
84844 its everybodys desire for the trials to be as open as possible
84845 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
84846 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
84847 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
84848 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom

84850 of most immediate effect to consumers was his appeal to the u s congress to suspend the 18 4 cent federal gas tax and 24 4 cent diesel tax from memorial day at the end of may to labor day in early september
84851 a usa today analysis showed that mccains gas tax proposal could save motorists 6 8 billion in taxes during the summer
84852 republicans and independents should sign in at their polling place and request a democratic ballot they should then vote for barack obama just think no more clintons in the white house
84853 pre caucus polling had obama in a head to head battle among democratic voters with sen hillary clinton
84854 its just another opportunity for him to create that lasting republican majority he envisioned years ago and to spend his waking days doing what he so enjoys beating democrats in the alleys and gutters just ask sen hillary clinton mr roves target when he called in to speak to rush limbaugh he couldnt help it mr rove just had to take one last shot before riding out of town more to come team clinton
84855 it seems a lot of republicans took to heart obamas statement in his rousing speech at the 2004 democratic national convention that there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america
84856 there is no candidate on record a front runner for a partys nomination who has entered the primary season with negatives as high as she has
84857 senior advisers confirmed that hagel a highly decorated vietnam war veteran and one of mccains closest friends in the senate was considered an ideal candidate for defence secretary
84858 some regard the outspoken republican as a possible vice presidential nominee although that might be regarded as a stretch
84859 change we can believe in begins to take on a whole new sinister
84860 senator obamas staff was sending us copies of the bill to review and we could see it weakening with each successive draft said joe cosgrove a park district director in will county ill
84861 government investigators and consumer advocates have contended that superior engaged in unsound financial activities and predatory lending practices ms pritzker a longtime friend and supporter of sen obama served for a time as superiors chairman and later sat on the board of its holding company
84862 in addition to the development fees a separate davis owned company stood to make another 900 000 through federal tax credits
84863 rezkos company used subsidies to rehabilitate more than 1 000 apartments mostly in and around obamas district then refused to manage the units leaving the buildings to decay to the point where many no longer were habitable
84864 rezko after all built part of his fortune by exploiting the black community that obama had served in the state senate and by milking government programs meant to benefit black owned businesses
84865 grove parc one of the projects and several other prominent failures were developed and managed by obamas close friends and political supporters
84866 those people profited from the subsidies even as many of obamas constituents suffered tenants lost their homes surrounding neighborhoods were blighted no one should have to live like this and no one did anything about it said cynthia ashley who has lived at grove parc since 1994
84867 mr auchi was convicted of corruption given a suspended sentence and fined 1 4 million in france in 2003 for his part in the elf affair described as the biggest political and corporate scandal in post war europe
84868 under a loan forgiveness agreement described in court mr auchi lent mr rezko 3 5 million in april 2005 and 11 million in september 2005 as well as the 3 5 million transferred in april 2007
84869 records show giannoulias and his family had given more than 10 000 to obamas campaign article stated emphasis added
84870 tillman was then under fire for her stewardship of the scandal plagued harold washington cultural center where contracts benefited members of her family
84871 obamas statement that he has no papers from his time in the illinois statehouse he left in 2004 stands in stark contrast to the massive clinton file stored at the national archives an estimated 78 million pages of documents plus 20 million e mail messages packed into 36 000 boxes
84872 iraqi officials initially blamed the americans and later claimed that a private security detail used by mr
84873 which he identified as the islamic army in iraq and the mujaheddin army were willing to enter negotiations with u s and iraqi officials
84874 the illinois senators fundraising receives far less press attention than clintons
84875 when the washington post reported last month that obama used a political action committee to hand more than 180 000 to democratic groups and candidates in the early voting states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina the suggestion that he might be buying support received no attention on the network newscasts
84876 the manifestation of some of the sexism that has gone on in this campaign is somehow more respectable or at least more accepted and there should be equal rejection of the sexism and the racism when it raises its ugly head
84877 it does seem as though the press at least is not as bothered by the incredible vitriol that has been engendered by the comments by people who are nothing but misogynists
84878 as an african american i find his words and his tone to be very depressing

84944 i then realised who i was dealing with he masetlha came to mislead me about the surveillance of mr macozoma i became very suspicious
84945 this is not stalins russia nazi germany or apartheid south africa do we conclude that surveillance is warranted if an agent is sitting in the same coffee bar as mr macozoma they are not even sitting together they are nodding at each other
84946 foreign agents are very sociable people there is no way that this minister will play cold war spy games in which im told that a man is a suspect because he was in the same coffee bar please this is not mickey mouse or disneyland this is very serious stuff
84947 i wasnt sure ive asked the question why didnt they take macozoma into their confidence and tell him we believe that he will be contacted by a foreign agent who will try to influence him
84948 a deep rooted suspicion emerged in various ways it seemed that mr masetlha became extremely involved in the trafficking of these emails i became deeply suspicious of what this man was up to on the one hand there was incompetence but on the other he was not reporting to me
84949 mr masetlha was playing into the conspiracy theory of anc president zuma one that hes been advancing for the past few years claiming that there is a conspiracy to prevent him from becoming president

84957 has chosen to turn a blind eye to the worsening education crisis and a deaf ear to the teachers clamor for better pay in the face of dire economic conditions
84958 mrs arroyo confirmed once again that the sona is indeed the magic portal to an enchanted kingdom listening to last mondays speech will leave you with the impression that its all business as usual in the education sector
84959 the huge decline in participation rates among school age children
84960 this has in fact prodded us to intensify our oplan balik eskwela operation back to school and brigada eskwela school brigade program to encourage parents to send their kids to school at no cost weve also asked local government units to come up with anti truancy ordinance so parents will ensure their childrens constant presence in school
84961 can count on the support of organizations such as act in educating the public on key education issues
84962 numerous flaws and limitations in the governments system of vouchers and subsidies which mrs arroyo mentioned in her speech
84963 but they are only available for high school theres no equivalent for elementary they are also limited in scale
84964 and lower middle class students of private high schools are the main beneficiaries not the poor who are dropping out
84965 expression of caring for the plight of public school teachers in her sona
84966 if she truly cares then why has she totally ignored our demand for a p9 000 increase that will give teachers decent salaries and restore the status of the teaching profession it seems that she cares more for military and police personnel to whom her administration has granted substantial hikes in pay and benefits over the years
84967 it is im sorry to say that it is theres no place in this campaign for that
84968 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
84969 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
84970 so far all we have heard is paris hilton and britney spears
84971 i have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
84972 we started planting when the rains were supposed to come in march but then it never rained so all the seeds rotted
84973 my ox died because i couldnt feed it and now i cant plough this land quick enough to plant more maize i will have to sell everything off to buy food but then i dont know how i will feed everyone after that
84974 were worried what will happen if the rations go down any further
84975 this is the most desperate situation i have ever seen
84976 you can see that many people here are very ill from food shortages those most severely affected children are now getting help but the number of malnourished children is growing all the time and this is a real concern
84977 many babies have already died here and i think many more will die in the months to come not only children but also adults are becoming very weak nobody has anything to eat at all
84978 there have been vast improvements made here especially when you consider that this year we are facing a myriad of problems that is making the situation very difficult to handle
84979 its simple economics people dont have enough money to buy the food they need

84987 latar belakangnya karena dulu tinggal dipesantren pas masa masa dimana saya sedang kepengen cewek ekh yang ada cowok mungkin itu kali ya
84988 kondisi keluarga lah yang ngebuat saya menjadi seperti sekarang ini jadi jika ingin menyalahkan jangan pernah mencoba untuk menyalahkah saya
84989 dan potongan kalimat tersebut merupakan salah satu jawaban yang berbeda dari ketiga informan dengan tema permasalahan yang sama yakni latarbelakang menjadi homoseksual
84990 ya seiring dengan waktu saya mulai menyadari saya ini memang gay prosesnya tercipta diluar dugaan saya sebelumnya dan proses tersebut terkadang cukup menyakitkan
84991 aku ga mampu buat kontrol apa yang ada di diri aku jadi yang terjadi aku menjadi gay prosesnya
84992 cukup banyak proses yang harus saya lalui seperti mencari siapa yang pantas saya cintai karena dia mencintai saya ga jauh jauh dapatnya dari dalam sendiri tapi situ kan uda saya bilang kalo dia ga cinta ma saya sebatas sayang aja
84993 wah pastinya shock karena saat itu saya sedang digilir oleh para senior
84994 pengalaman dimana waktu itu aku baru aja pulang dari sekolah trus waktu sedang ganti seragam tiba tiba aja si om meraba raba dan mendekap tubuh mungil ku
84995 pada saat salah satu informan menyampaikan hal ini terdapat penekanan dalam nada bicaranya yang mengindikasikan suatu perasaan benci dan kesal serta sedikit trauma pada ketiga informan ini sebuah pengalaman pertama tidak terjadi begitu saja semua itu telah direkonstruksi dalam pikiran mereka ada yang membekas sebagai trauma dan ada juga yang menjadikan itu sebagai sebuah alasan untuk menyatakan bahwa mereka adalah seorang gay tulen pada tahap epoche dimana peneliti melihat bahwa setiap manusia memiliki pengalaman hidup yang berbeda beda terlebih pengalaman pertama dalam melakukan sesuatu hal yang akan memberikan mereka suatu identitas diri tahap reduksi fenomenologi peneliti mulai melihat apa yang tejadi pada diri informan yakni mereka dilecehkan sebagai seorang remaja dan bentuk pelecehan yang terjadi dalam bentuk pelecehan seksual dan di tahap variasi imajinatif para informan mulai menunjukkan sikap sudah mulai bisa menerima kejadian yang menjadi pengalaman pertama tersebut kejadian yang mereka sebut sebagai pengalaman pertama menjadi gay itu terjadi disbabkan beberapa faktor yang berbeda yang pada intinya mereka masih terlalu muda dalam menyikapi apa yang terjadi pada diri mereka pada saat itu apa alasan yang menjadikan anda seorang gay salahkah kalaupun saya memilih menjadi gay itu alasan yang sampai sekarang jika terpikir hampir membuat saya gila sendiri
84996 ga pernah cinta sama cewek sih tapi siapa yang ga pengen normal alasan untuk menjadikan saya seorang pecinta pria pada dasarnya ya hanya itu
84997 sosok pria lebih menyenangkan daripada wanita yang cenderung memiliki ambisi untuk menguasai segalanya dari diri kita dan mereka juga cenderung kasar dengan pasangan
84998 saya berasal dari latarbelakang keluarga yang memiliki reputasi yang cukup baik masalah profesi juga salah satu hal yang menuntut saya memilih sembunyi sembunyi menjadi gay
84999 wah bisa bisa bonyok ku mati kena serangan jantung trus ga ada satu pun warga yang bakl mau nolongin buat nguburin hahaha masih belum diterima disini seorang gay
85000 anda kan tahu kalau disini masih kuat segala norma norma itu saya tidak tahan dengan itu semua oleh karena itu saya lebih memilih untuk menjadi terselubung disini dan nantinya setelah mendapatkan pasangan yang tepat saya akan meninggalkan negara ini ke tempat dimana gay tidak perlu harus sembunyi sembunyi
85001 sangat sulit menemukan komunitas tersebut terlebih saya juga cukup sibuk untuk menyempatkan diri mencari komunitas yang sepertinya sangat menyenangkan itu
85002 ya adalah kita punya organisasinya pun namanya hagam atau kepanjangan dari hai gay medan sekarang neh sedang buat usaha untuk mengurus badan hukum dari organisasi komunitas gay medan
85003 di sini saya ga begitu tahu ya tapi saya langsung ketemu sama mereka di suatu tempat di medan ini seperti tempat tempat dugem itupun para gay non medan
85004 pastinya saya menemukan pasangan saya di tempat gym disana saya dapat dengan mudah mendapatkan pasangan itulah kali pertama saya dikirimi sinyal sinyal kalo kita ini satu komunitas
85005 lewat internet sih kan lebih mudah mencarinya lewat situs pertemanan gay kita juga langsung bisa tahu semua tentang calon pasangan kita dan dapat mengirimkan private message trus ketemuan deh
85006 saya mendapatkan komunitas gay di medan cukup sulit makanya saya cari gay yang di luar aja ada luar kota sampe luar negeri selain tampangnya lebih cakep proses pencariannya cukup mudah dan tidak harus sembunyi sembunyi
85007 tidak karena menurut saya hal itu terlalu menyolok mata sehingga nantinya semua orang pada tahu kalo saya ini gay komunitas kan merupakan suatu perkumpulan individu yang memiliki sesuatu yang sama apalagi sepengalaman saya komunitas gay itu cukup gampang dilirik keberadaannya
85008 nyaman banget saya dapat menumpahkan semua hal disana dan yang paling penting dari semua adalah bahwa saya merasa sangat normal di komunitas tersebut dan ga ada yang salah dengan saya saya bebas mencintai dan juga balas dicintai
85009 cukup nyaman komunitas gay seperti rumah yang selama ini saya dambakan tempat yang paling tepat untuk menjalani aktifitas pribadi setelah penatnya menjalani semua hal hal yang sifatnya memuakkan
85010 pada saat berada bersama komunitas gay mungkin cukup nyaman namun saya bisa memastikan bahwa saya masih ragu takut dan malu kalau harus menghadapi masyarakat awam dan menunjukkan identitas serta komunitas gay yang saya jalani
85011 sebenarnya saya ga gitu peduli ya tapi berhubung saya masih punya keluarga yah kasian kan mereka juga jadi karena gay sifatnya masih terselubung saya sampai sekarang enjoy aja beda soal kalau gay ntar jadi trend
85012 saya ga takut ngadepin masyarat mereka jangan hanya taunya mengucilkan saja lah apa mereka ga pernah merasa mereka juga pasti ga pernah sempurna dalam hidup ini so saya sebenarnya ga kan pernah ragu buat nunjukkin eksistensi kami di masyarakat
85013 saya tidak yakin dengan sadar atau tidaknya orang orang dengan komunitas ini tapi meamng komunitas ini eksis di tengah tengah masyarakat
85014 oh tentu saja hagam kan nantinya akan dipublikasikan tuh jadi masyarakat pasti akan tahu eksistensi kami para gay dan kalaupun ntar menuai kontroversi kami sejak paguyuban ini akan dibuat telah memikirkan jalan untuk mengatasi dampak negatif yang mungkin terjadi
85015 kami memang eksis di tengah tengah masyarakat karena kami juga bagian dari masyarakat tapi sepertinya masyarakat tidak begitu tahu akan eksistensi komunitas gay yang sebenarnya sudah cukup luas dan terkadang sebenarnya begitu dekat dengan mereka
85016 saya tidak begitu tahu untuk hal ini tapi secara garis besarnya bentuk identitas yang didapatkan berupa suatu cap keanggotaan tak resmi yang dapat membantu saya dalam mengakses segala kebutuhan homoseksual saya sedangkan identitas dari masyarakat akan cenderung terikat dengan norma norma yang berlaku
85017 identitas yang saya dapatkan di komunitas tersebut bisa menjadi ganda sedangkan di masyarakat hanya satu yakni cuma sebagai lelaki saja tapi pada komunitas gay ada sebuah nilai yang cukup berharga yang bisa saya dapatkan suatu identitas yang dapat sesuka hati saya pilih apakah identitas sebagai seorang pria ataupun wanita atau malah kedua duanya dalam sekali berhubungan kita sebut identitas ini dengan istilah pemberian nama cantik
85018 tentunya identitas ini lebih spesial karena merupakan identitas yang cukup luar biasa yang dapat kita raih dan telah melekat dalam diri kita identitas yang memiliki prestise tersendiri di kalangan gay dan ga sembarangan loh untuk mendapatkan identitas ini lain halnya dengan di masyarakat semua orang memiliki identitas seksual yang sama yang membuatnya menjadi nampak cukup monoton dan bersifat memaksa
85019 anda pasti akan takjub ketika melihat saya memainkan peranan ganda
85020 di saat itu kamu akan melihat bagaimana aku berjalan dicatwalk ngedate dengan beberapa wanita yang cukup cantik dan beberapa hal yang sifatnya glamor setelah itu kamu juga akan melihat bagaimana aku dugem hangout dan ga ketinggalan bercumbu dengan kekasih yang sebenarnya yaitu para gay yang cakep
85021 saya tipe pria pekerja keras dan dicap sebagai seorang bussiness man yang cukup tinggi jam terbangnya hampir ga ada waktu buat menjalani aktiftas percintaan di mata orang sekitar saya memandang bahwa saya orang yang tidak mementingkan hal lain selain bisnis nah pada sisi yang lain saya akan berperan sebagai pria yang manja dengan pasangan saya dan dapat melepaskan segala keinginan yang selama ini terselubung biasanya saya melakukan aktifitas tersebut di sebuah hotel karena sifatnya private dan juga aman dari gangguan yang mungkin muncul secara tiba tiba
85022 saya sudah memiliki seorang istri sekarang dia sedang mengandung tapi perlu anda camkan bahwa saya bukan biseksual itu hanya sebagai topeng yang saya pakai untuk menutupi identitas ke gay an saya
85023 ada kok ini juga uda jalan 8 bulan sama dia sama sama model kita bedua kan sama sama sibuk jadi ga ada alasan buat terlalu jauh untuk masuk ke dunia pribadi pasangan mungkin karena itu juga dia ga tau kalo aku ini gay pacaran ama satu cewek manado ekh ternyata aku dijadiin dia umpan buat nutupi identitas lesbinya
85024 tidak sama sekali saya lebih senang dicap sebagai pria yang terlalu sibuk daripada harus menutupi kehomoan saya dengan cara berhubungan dengan seorang wanita pun
85025 ga ada ya saya tetap menggunakan bahasa seperti halnya saya berbicara dengan kamu saat ini
85026 ada dong tapi bahasa verbal itu biasanya dipakai sama gay yang berorientasi sissy alias kecewek an malah hampir bisa disebut kalo itu bahasa kaum waria yang pada basicnya emank gay yang transeksual memang saya terkadang menggunakan bahasa planet atau makcik contohnya neh
85027 saya tidak ingin terlalu menyolok mata dengan menggunakan berbagai macam aksesori pada tubuh saya
85028 aku seorang gay yang metroseksual dan camkan bahwa ga semua metroseksual juga gay ya aku sih kalau mau berinteraksi dengan sesama itu pake
85029 saya kadang masih suka pake jam dan anting di kanan
85030 mungkin karena saya ga begitu ahli kalau ditanya mengenai simbol simbol ini karena sepertinya dapat gay itu untung untungan aja
85031 saya mencari pasangan gay di tempat gym dan biasanya mereka langsung menghampiri saya untuk menyapa dan dilanjutkan dengan tahap perkenalan ga ada metode khusus ya karena mereka sendiri yang mendekati saya dan hampir ga pernah saya yang mendatangi duluan
85032 pertama sih kenalnya dari kawan ke kawan juga kita kan punya link trus dari sana tambah deh teman baru tapi kalau mau cari sendiri ya pake metode gay dar tadi tapi disini harus ingat kalau kamu harus punya feeling yang kuat karena salah salah bisa bonyok tuh muka
85033 saya kenal langsung dari teman ada satu teman kita yang biasa disebut si mafia nah dia lah cukong yang nyariin teman sesama gay jadi ga perlu pake metode yang agak agak ribet gitu karena sekarang ini perbedaan antara gay dan yang
85034 banyak arti yang bisa didapat dari berbagai macam simbol itu dari sana kita juga bisa punya kode kode yang orang lain ga pada tahu fungsi utamanya biar kita lebih gampang buat saling kenal
85035 fungsi utamanya sih sebagai pemersatu bagi kelompok kita jika sesuatu itu mengandung arti kan berarti hanya kita aja yang tau
85036 dalam dunia gay ada 3 golongan besar yaitu top bot dan versatile versatile ini dibagi dua lagi top dan bot top itu untuk pria bot wanita tapi kalau versatile dia bisa jadi cewek ataupun cowoknya tergantung keinginan dan kesepakatan
85037 saya kan berperan sebagai pria nya jadi ketika membedakan dialah wanitanya dalam hubungan sejenis cukup dilihat ketika kami melakukan hubungan seksual biasanya saya yang
85038 dari hati yang paling dalam sebenarnya saya tidak menikamti menjadi homoseksual ada suatu perasaan dosa besar yang menghinggapi setiap saya melakukan hubungan seksual dan perasaan bersalah kepada pasangan yang terkadang membuat saya berniat untuk bunuh diri
85039 enjoy banget karena saya dapat menjadi diri saya yang seutuhnya
85040 kenikmatan itulah yang membuat saya bertahan menjadi homoseksual saya tidak mampu memdenskripsikan kenikmatan menjadi seorang homoseksual hanya persaaan saya yang merasakan kenikmatan tersebut

85093 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
85094 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
85095 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since

85105 the core of microsoft growth is based around office the server products and sharepoint i think this is a huge announcement in terms of giving people the ability to choose
85106 we wanted to eliminate the advantage microsoft has with the office monopoly and this eliminates that advantage for microsoft because now a user can choose to use alfresco as easily as they would choose to use sharepoint
85107 if he beats his chest and says we are not playing fair or whatever like this is some closed secret of microsoft then i think that proves that sharepoint is the worse product but if its really as good a product as they say then should not be ashamed to have it compete fairly with alfresco

85123 the hudsons been both a pastoral landscape and an industrialized one
85124 its that interaction that makes it such a rich chaotic and interesting place its a microcosm of the entire history of american environmentalism landscape romanticism and industrialization played out more intensely here than anywhere i can think of
85125 in those days a lot of people did things just because they could he loved the idea of it
85126 there were just mounds of weeds poison ivy locusts there were little trails that led out to this point but the point at high tide was full of water at low tide it was the exposed stumps of pilings and a lot of industrial refuse
85127 the deindustrialization of the hudson river has been for aesthetic purposes as well as environmental ones

85150 sta pensando di lanciare in pista per il dopo veltroni qualche nome nuovo qualcuno che rappresenti un cambio generazionale e che non provenga dalla storia del pci e dei ds per esempio un emiliano come pierluigi bersani ma diverso per et e origine filippo andreatta
85151 si utilizzata unidea innovativa quella di un partito allamericana per rilegittimare vizi antichi e tipicamente italiani invece che per innescare quel processo di cambiamento radicale che i cittadini chiedevano un cinismo che pu rasentare lipocrisia che ha contribuito ad allontanare molti elettori dal pd
85152 veltroni potrebbe mantenere la leadership abbandonando per la pretesa di essere per forza il prossimo candidato alle elezioni potrebbe cos dedicarsi libero da condizionamenti a costruire una coalizione in grado di battere il centrodestra e un partito nuovo in cui le vecchie nomenklature lascino il posto a una nuova non solo anagraficamente classe dirigente
85153 breaking off from his holiday in cornwall to speak to a group of young listeners of radio 1s newsbeat programme mr cameron said some of the friends i had the ones who had the biggest problems were the ones who actually were never allowed to drink anything at home whereas the ones who drink responsibly were the ones who were given a glass of wine or a small glass of beer or a shandy or something
85154 all things being equal the simplest solution is the best
85155 while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes which means that while washing the dishes one should be completely aware of the fact that one is washing the dishes at first glance that might seem a little silly why put so much stress on a simple thing but thats precisely the point the fact that i am standing there and washing the dishes is a wondrous reality im being completely myself following my breath conscious of my presence and conscious of my thoughts and actions theres no way i can be tossed around mindlessly like a bottle slapped here and there on the waves

85172 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
85173 in recent years we have witnessed the benefit that a web site like wikipedia can have on all knowledge
85174 i once found the most retarded thing on ubuntu to add mp3 capability you have to search the ubuntu wiki even if the user downloads xmms or another mp3 player they still have to search some site to add basic stuff that windows users didnt have to deal with since windows 95
85175 monetise if you will body parts plant parts car parts and planets as a way to generate incremental revenue on an installed base of several million active users

85185 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year
85186 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
85187 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
85188 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
85189 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
85190 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
85191 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
85192 the basic idea with wikia search is to have a freely licensed open source search engine in which all the software is released publicly
85193 its designed wiki style so anyone can enter and change anything
85194 every edit that you make is a public act so other people can check your work and see what youve done
85195 weve reached a plateau in search theres a possibility that by re introducing some human intelligence into the process you can get better results
85196 there are tools available that the community needs to self manage so that you can have aneffective community that keeps out spam and works on quality
85197 weve never not recognized an officer shot in the line of duty

85200 its a basic public complaint that has to be followed up on
85201 i certainly welcome a fresh look to come in and oversee us
85202 this is a public complaint and everyone has the opportunity to complain if they arent satisfied
85203 i think this is a good way to settle the complaint
85204 i have 100 per cent faith in my officers and i know i did my job the way i was supposed to do it
85205 now well have someone completely independent come in and take a look at it
85206 we cant comment on anything thats ongoing before appropriate authorities have a chance to make a report
85207 but i can say that its being handled with utmost accuracy and confidentiality
85208 this is one of the most popular playgrounds in pictou county and its one of the largest rubberized surface parks in nova scotia
85209 the benefits of a rubberized surface are comfort reduced maintenance and the ability to use it soon after a rainfall
85210 loxley nuces book brings many important points about the sports betting world into focus
85211 and i myself plan to buy a copy and study it in depth its not often that we come across such a thorough and lucid analysis of sports betting industry and design
85212 i for one plan to buy the book long after the initial sales rush is over
85213 when everyone is rushing in at once taking little time to actually review the work we tend to move too quickly to judgment you have to be careful especially when considering the breadth of the sports betting industry
85214 this is really showing people that the sports betting business world is not elitist but really consumer friendly thoughtful and dynamic with these new views the sports betting companies of today and tomorrow can move forward
85215 im floored weve had to send out trucks with double and triple orders just to keep up with the rush one semi alone went to patria jahns inc the countrys largest sports betting investment bureau weve literally made thousands in a matter of hours
85216 this book has something for everyone there is a good true story a little suspense solid fact and a great critical analysis of sports betting operation in moder society
85217 its absolutely ludicrous to even think of this kind of tax im not in favour of going forward with this at all i made a mistake i voted and then after i did my research and got information on this i know i made a mistake
85218 we were told it was conducive in other municipalities in nova scotia and it may be in other major centres but not in pictou county this would be a bad omen for the town we have a good thing going in westville to put this tax in place would be killer
85219 its a nice way to make money but it will cut down the number of people who buy here
85220 theyll take one look at that and say to hell with that im not going to pay the town of westville just to register my deed ill go somewhere else
85221 you couldnt give away a house in stellarton for two years or so
85222 if everybody had it it would be a level playing field and it would be a different story westville could go with the flow
85223 but if its not a level playing field no way

85226 a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools

85240 you should always strive to make everything as simple as possible if not simpler
85241 today were flooded with information its an information overload and were not capable of handling it
85242 this would relieve us from the anxiousness or need to try to remember everything and theres the issue of trouble with recollection its like your index is broken you know you know something but you cant get there this could help people having trouble with their memory reconstruct their memories
85243 after you take the pictures you place them in the system
85244 you stockpile the images in a server in addition to taking the picture you collect the contextual information like embedding gps information into the picture along with the time when the picture is uploaded the software looks at your calendar to see what you were doing at that time then it can cluster images into groups based on time location and calendar and it will label the clusters

85262 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
85263 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
85264 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
85265 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
85266 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
85267 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
85268 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

85561 i grew up in the east coast in the united states and was a journalist in new york during my 20s i wrote for a lot of magazines including esquire and the new yorker and for the new york times my official awakening happened quite spontaneously in my apartment i was actually listening to a grateful dead record when i was totally flooded out of nowhere with a feeling of unconditional love which i had never experienced in that power and measure before and in which i had immediately realized that everything that i ever longed for all my life it was a state that lasted a couple of days and it really changed the way i lived my life i had been writing sort of intense feminist articles on suffering and pain from that moment on i began actually doing a lot of inner self exploration my path led me to a couple of a very full on situations with meditative practices and in 1974 i met my teacher

85625 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
85626 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools

85634 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe they re using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues he ll continue to talk about

85645 the planning commission has estimated the fund requirement of rs 4 10 897 crore for the likely capacity addition of 68 869 mw during the 11th plan however considering the recent trends in inflation this amount is now seen as substantially low therefore there should be an upward revision for the funds to be invested in the power sector to ensure that 11th five year plan targets are met
85646 the elephant death rate from poaching throughout africa is about 8 percent a year based on recent studies which is actually higher than the 7 4 percent annual death rate that led to the international ivory trade ban nearly 20 years ago
85647 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
85648 with such information authorities can beef up enforcement efforts and focus them in specific areas where poaching is known to occur as a means of preventing elephants from being killed
85649 but that will only happen if there is sufficient public pressure to marshal funding for a much larger international effort to halt the poaching
85650 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
85651 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat

85661 our performance in the second quarter has enabled us to show improved profitability compared with the first six months of 2007 our services and solutions business is growing particularly strongly on the one hand and we are now starting to see a tangible increase in our new integrated product offerings on the other
85662 the quarters strong growth was driven by our teams ability to cross sell and up sell the breadth of our product portfolio which is reflected in the number of large transactions that include multiple products
85663 ncrs strong second quarter results were broad based geographically and speak to continued solid demand for our self service solutions even in a challenging global economy consumers want to connect interact and transact with businesses in new ways and ncr is at the forefront of helping our customers meet that demand
85664 our success is being driven by the strength of our solutions which enable our clients to retain and enhance relationships with existing customers provide great customer experiences and demonstrate a quick and measurable return on investment
85665 services revenues were lower due in part to our transition to on demand implementations which average less than half the time of our perpetual on premise implementations

85670 nike is a company that exists to serve athletes hence this limited exception to allow nike swimmers to compete without distractions was the correct thing to do given the very unique circumstances
85671 the problem was rampant at our company mostly with the customer service staff in between orders we notified them that we were monitoring their internet use and there was still abuse it is akin to an addiction sometimes it was 2 hours a day we were forced to install blocking software they complained loud and long about not having access to their personal email but the monitoring showed surfing drastically reduced nearly eliminated
85672 our biggest problem comes from employees spending time on the myspace websites the surprising thing to me is that i thought this was strictly a young persons phenomenon however i was wrong in that assumption we have a number of employees who have been disciplined for spending an inordinate amount of time on said site
85673 my research indicates that some industries have documented personal internet usage to be up to 3 4 hours per day thats pretty egregious time wasting i think it warrants it intervention and use of monitoring software we found a lot of violations when we installed monitoring software
85674 supervisors do or should know the work behaviors of their employees and should address abuse of any kind it is however necessary to have some kind of policy in place for supervisors to refer to something that states that business equipment and business technology is for business use all of our employees are required to sign an acknowledgment of our it security policy during new hire orientation even though there may be some universal fudging permitted or at least tolerated the abuser should always be expecting to be counseled for misuse of business time equipment and technology if a supervisor is slack in addressing abuse the abuser may erroneously assume that a privilege once granted becomes a right
85675 at our place of business most employees operate mentally at a professional level and will take care of the businesss business however we cannot assume that everyone does therefore our it department is involved in controlling abuse by installing websense limits to internet access supervisors and the ceo must approve access to sites that would normally fall outside the realm of business by using such controls our employees understand that internet use is monitored that alone is an inhibitor to abuse if employees know that there are limits they wont be inclined to abuse the standard wiggle room that is universally acceptable if they do issue a stern warning that repeated abuse will lead to termination and then follow through if necessary
85676 there are definitely some sites that should be blocked but if you start micromanaging people morale will start to diminish we hear repeatedly about how much employees steal from their employers every year i have never seen any study or research on how much employees pay out of their pockets for using their personal cell phone car etc for work use these employees just do it with out reimbursement if we employers stop focusing on the negative and start looking at our employees as assets our employees are going to bend over backwards for us many of our employees already do
85677 many policies are written to address specific abuses of a small percentage of employees our philosophy is that employees who spend inordinate amounts of time surfing the web on personal telephone calls visiting with co workers etc generally do not get their jobs done or meet their objectives if they can do their jobs and still waste time on unproductive activities it is often poor supervision
85678 my recommendation would be to depend less on administrative remedies and to concentrate on creating a work environment that stresses discipline achievement and teamwork the supervisor is the key

85705 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
85706 i heard about his skills when he was doing his thing in chicago i definitely heard some rumors that he was going to run but i just wanted to feel his vibe man hes real down to earth his energy is great hes just an honest dude and hes all about change im all for change im just pro obama i dont think theres anybody better who can be put in that office right now besides that man
85707 i wish we could take credit for the number of deaths
85708 the writers damian shannon and mark swift after we had done everything said did you notice how many kills there were and we said yeah there are a lot they said actually there are 13 so the writers had figured that out
85709 we also show what jasons doing when hes not killing
85710 hes just great on it and people didnt know that its fun to watch
85711 our character has been rejected hes pulled away from society he wants to live by himself and all of a sudden these kids come into his area and disrespect his area and he has nowhere to go hes like a caged animal with his back against the wall and he albeit in a bad way protects himself
85712 my knees got pretty damaged i had some bad knee problems afterwards and it took me about four weeks to really recover from it it definitely isnt as campy as the original friday the 13th movies they were what they were for their day but when you look at them now you dont get as creeped out its a different feel i think the audiences are demanding a little bit more of horror movies now so ours is a lot of blood and guts and weapons and stuff like that
85713 ive been doing the character background the victimization of jason since he was abused as a child he was always the outcast
85714 he was always shunned by society so ive taken the stance that its almost like a vietnam flashback where someone has been victimized and abused so badly that when things resurface and these kids start to encroach on his area he is once again having a flashback its a moment so intense that hes getting his revenge for when he saw his mother get murdered hes still in the moment like these people just recently murdered his mother and hes having his revenge
85715 we had to keep the hockey mask which is where it all started and camp crystal lake as a jumping off point for us to go back to the first one
85716 we wanted to make a movie that was fun and we havent done that before
85717 a lot of our movies i think have been more dreary and tended more towards what they call torture porn the scares are so scary but the scares are happening to kids that you love because you had a fun experience with them these are kids who are drinking smoking and having sex and its been a long time since youve seen that on the big screen were hoping that those two things coming together will give the audience a new experience with a horror movie
85718 being able to put all my love of chinese culture into a fantasy like the mummy and the wildness of it that was a challenge i couldnt turn down
85719 weve taken the premise of relocating the oconnells from egypt and putting them in china which is as we all know another archaeologically rich nation a long time ago rob was a harvard major in archeology with a special interest in chinese studies so this was a passion piece for him
85720 we have an idea of what he does how he does it
85721 getting to help defeat jet li that was kind of fun jet li is someone that is a power and entity
85722 i really wanted to say hey i helped beat jet li up
85723 they would have to sew me in in that first fight every time i flipped my pantyhose were always down around my ankles
85724 provided a statement to law enforcement that was useful in the sheriffs office investigation of our case
85725 thats definitely been the rumor and its been coming from their camp so i really cant conform that at all i positively cannot confirm that i hear that its his birthday that weekend so he might be in town but these guys youre never going to know anything until the last minute anyway thats what ive been told ive heard those same rumors and that would be really cool right but there are definitely no guarantees youll just have to settle on listening to great music
85726 tom morello man i tell you what tom morello is the real deal and you will not be disappointed
85727 well you start walking the grounds and they start loading everything in and you see sort of how your blueprints working out
85728 youve got everything from the stages to the sound and lights to your backstages your artist area your vip area your cabana area and then you get floods of friends and guests that want to come and where are you going to accommodate them and you get new areas youre putting in you always have sound issues because you have so many stages so you have to position each stage and the speakers so they dont affect that other area
85729 weve got a ton of trees in grant park and were really maximizing those trees this year
85730 aside from the music the other thing were creating here is a scene
85731 its the most important aspect of lollapalooza aside from the music and the musicians themselves it goes right to the audience and whos there people want to bop around and meet people and maybe hook up so were always looking to create social situations and social stimulations within the grounds
85732 as far as our single day ticket counts radiohead seem to have taken this year
85733 radiohead sold out first and their production is just incredible
85734 we also have nine inch nails and trent reznors production is one of the best in the world
85735 i can tell you that on the inside hes ramping up if you thought nine inch was great before and the production was great before theyre stepping it up that much more now and when jack white came in with the raconteurs the first time lots of people said it was the best act weve had i am assuming these guys have developed and evolved together so thats going to be a great rock show
85736 this year i couldnt ask for a better lineup but its going to be quite something to top 2008 we are the biggest festival in the country overflowing with 75 000 people a day so i think this year were done weve done it but next year were already speaking and planning and guess what next year looks fantastic it really is unbelievable
85737 well i cant be racist i mean i have black friends

85740 readers will take this admission as being tantamount to me admitting that i am in some way backwards awkward or archaic in other words undesirable but you see that is exactly the point i am trying to make

85747 i think at the end of the day it was one of those situations that caught me off guard

85749 the concept is to bring all the people together as one person linking as one world at the state of where the world is now with all these wars and conflict all over the place i think a record like that is needed thats the best time when a voice needs to be heard i felt like what better voice between me and mike to be able to say something like that at the time we in outside of trying to do a club record or a record we expect to get thousand of spins it was more so lets do a record that fits all formats but also has some meaning to it but of course for the future well be finishing up the rest of the record
85750 were gonna set up a whole tour around it its a big play
85751 she was mad cool down to earth yet conservative polite she felt like a high school friend she felt mad approachable cool as hell we had a great time working the chemistry was right on point the record shows it because we came up with a smash
85752 i realize i been foolish i never should have turned my back
85753 cause its a cold world when youre out there all alone so many times i wanted to pick up the phone and tell you ooh baby baby i miss your loving so
85754 do you think we can pick up where we left off before the day that i told you it was over packed my things and moved away
85755 she really aint actually we switched some words around so people dont think she was singing about bobby this record is more of a record that anyone going through that situation would be able to relate to its just the fact that she got out of a situation is what made it more relevant im doing two records for her album
85756 clearly weve had more redemptions than usual and we cant match them by fresh investment which is the normal way we would run the fund
85757 in the current market where investors are looking to reduce their exposure to property investments we believe we are acting in the best interests of investors by temporarily suspending activity to preserve the quality of the fund
85758 i regard here as my home and the people as my people
85759 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
85760 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
85761 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on

86230 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
86231 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
86232 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
86233 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy

86235 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
86236 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
86237 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
86238 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
86239 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
86240 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it

86247 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
86248 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream

86285 it was very frustrating because i didnt know how it was going to pull up i was in pain through the whole match
86286 the pain wasnt so sharp but i couldnt hold my racquet on my forehand
86287 i tried to fight as much as i could i really wanted to win this match but obviously shes a very good player she figured it out
86288 the first thing i was thinking was well girl you made it
86289 the second thing was that it was the first top 10 player ive beaten ive had a lot of chances before and played some great matches but never did that it was also the first night match i won in my career
86290 so there were a lot of first times today i dont know how but i managed it
86291 im currently packing up really quick to hop on the plane and head to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let all of you know first that theres no chance of me competing in beijing

86293 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
86294 after taking a few different exams and mris this morning the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
86295 there are so many mixed feelings because last night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
86296 but after the tests this morning for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
86297 but on the other hand this is something that needs a lot of time to heal which really hurts me to say that i have to miss the olympics

86322 it looks like the other broadcasters are using the wall to wall olympics coverage in daytime as an excuse to be mischievous and overly competitive
86323 it all seems a bit overly competitive of them to move kids across to bbc2 for the olympics and then shorten the blocks as well for no key reason apart from wanting to boost bbc2s daytime ratings
86324 all the additional programmes on bbc2 are repeats rather than key shows that they wouldnt have been able to take a break from
86325 the olympics happen once every four years and lasts for two weeks
86326 it generates huge interest in britain this year it is also the games which hands over the london 2012 games which will be of particular interest to audiences
86327 a number of other big sporting events like the world cup and wimbledon have similarly aired on bbc1 daytime and it is complete nonsense to suggest that we have changed the schedule for any other reason than that we believe it is of interest to both adults and childrens audiences
86328 additionally the time difference in beijing means that much of the live output takes place during daytime
86329 there is a very slight reduction in minutes of childrens output in week one but there will be an increase in childrens output in week two of the olympics plus for adult viewers who do not wish to watch the games there is an alternative daytime schedule on bbc2
86330 the 6pm flagship news programme for tyne tees border would include a 15 minute opt out for border and the same for tyne tees
86331 the border opt out will include cumbria southern scotland and the isle of man and will continue to be called lookaround in that region
86332 the full 30 minute lookaround programme and border news service to be maintained
86333 that itv has met many of the stakeholders from this region and has offered to support 15 minutes of news dedicated to the former border news region but this falls well short of what viewers want and ofcom seems to agree
86334 ofcom can only regulate whats on screen the draft of its review shows they are minded to reject itv plans to merge the border and tyne tees region
86335 but theres no guarantee of where itv will produce the news it could be produced from gateshead or leeds rather than carlisle
86336 we want to ask itv what are the economic savings for doing so

86345 if we can see off the opening period and these two powell and wallace can continue their partnership anything over 240 is going to be a bonus
86346 we had three partnerships of note the 120 from richard grant and gareth rees then 50 between richard and tom maynard and that last one of 60 odd between powell and wallace
86347 from ball jason gillespie and adam shantry set a really good tone and to restrict them to 200 was a good effort
86348 if wed held our catches it could have been 180 so it was pretty good but it set a good tone and robert croft opening the batting sent a message of intent when he opened the batting
86349 although he didnt get too many he did actually set that tone and thats quite vital to the younger members of the squad to follow his lead

86470 i thought maybe i had insulted somebody or there was a bill i didnt pay and when they took me in and sat me down and told me it was criminal and that i had a rape charge ive never felt that kind of a rush go through my body thats like being told you have cancer i mean when somebody attaches that to your name theres not a whole lot worse that can be attached to it i think child molestation might be worse murder might be worse though in some cases it might be better if its in your own defense thats just one thing you dont want tagged with your name
86471 the worst thing was when i went to a wal mart to pick up a cooler or something and theres this woman in her mid 30s whos probably a poison fan because she seemed to have recognized me and she grabs her four year old girl and just takes her around the corner to get her out of my line of sight as quick as she could that just hurt normally someone would say this is my daughter shes a future poison fan im used to that but im not used to someone taking their kid away because theyre scared of me

86503 fish out of water how water management in the bay delta threatens the future of californias salmon fishery
86504 the future of californias salmon fishery is completely dependent on how we manage water in the bay delta ecosystem
86505 california agencies must implement existing requirements to restore salmon reform management of the water projects and reduce water diversions california can meet its water supply needs and restore salmon and the health of the delta ecosystem by investing in fish friendly water supply alternatives including water conservation and recycling if we do so californians will once again be able to enjoy abundant local salmon in their rivers on their lines and on their plates
86506 the collapse of the salmon fishery is among the nations worst man made fishery disasters ever it is on par with the exxon valdez spill or the closure of the new england cod fishery but we believe that we can bring back our fishery if we do the right things in managing our waters in the rivers and in the delta we can save our salmon and save our birthright
86507 commercial salmon fishermen are paying a heavy price for the poaching of water from the bay delta the policy of this state is to double salmon populations not decimate them we need to reduce delta diversions if we expect to bring back the salmon the bottom line is fish need water if we give them enough water the salmon and the salmon fishery will return

86524 a death sentence by incarceration youre trading a slow form of death for a faster one
86525 western europeans regard 10 to 12 years as extremely long term even for offenders sentenced to life
86526 im the first to say that i made my share of mistakes in life im not perfect but life without the possibility of parole is a life draining sentence no matter how hard i try to better myself im treated as if i am the worst of the worst i cant sleep nights i cant rest in my body because this one bad choice to hang with friends could cost me my freedom forever
86527 we try to keep his spirits up by saying something will change in the law
86528 should suffer harsh criminal consequences for acting as a lookout in this case but to suggest that he ought to receive a sentence of life without the possibility of parole i find to be very very hard to swallow to the point where i can describe it as unconscionable
86529 he was convicted for the crimes of being poor and mexican
86530 hes just one of many there are so many people serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes hes a regular guy who was trying to make a living
86531 i have little hope at all this sentence is like a death sentence it is torture on my sanity theres no second chances for any of us no matter how good or bad i am these cruel prison conditions are all i have to look forward to
86532 studies have shown that offenders who have served over 20 years in prison rarely ever reoffend and never for a violent crime
86533 the recidivism rate for older inmates is less than 2 percent
86534 everyday that i wake up its a pain knowing that i have this sentence and if these devils get their way i will have to be here the rest of my days knowing this and being in this situation just the thought alone will kill you from the inside out a natural life sentence tells the public that you are a vile and insidious person and that you possess no rehabilitative potential to reenter society and be a productive citizen this is a bald faced lie and this lie can be brought to an end today

86539 appeared to reflect the administrations hopes that it can build on recent improvement in public opinion on iraq perceptions of how the war is going could be crucial for republicans chances in the 2008 election and especially presidential candidate john mccain who is closely identified with the surge strategy
86540 hes not only a leader hes a jewish leader and they follow what he has to say
86541 a tell that they think the state really is in play
86542 when mccain switched on drilling a lot of people said there goes florida
86543 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
86544 it means that some 98 000 pages of evidence which the state confiscated in raids on mr zumas homes and also those of his legal adviser at the time two of his legal advisers can be used as evidence against him in the corruption trial which is scheduled to get underway next week
86545 it flows out of the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser schabir sheik and it revolves around money that was said to have been solicited by zuma in order that he would intervene on behalf of a company bidding for parts of south africas arms deal
86546 on these particular matters yes but he will next week seek to have the entire case thrown out of court when his trial is due to begin in kwazulu natal province in pietermartizburg there are also other applications pending one in mauritius another in the united kingdom where he is seeking to have the release of documents to the national prosecuting authority blocked
86547 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
86548 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
86549 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom
86550 never change do what you do best its what we love about you
86551 if it were true that money were being offered to me it would be the worst form of corruption
86552 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
86553 is not ideal since it deprives the public of being able to make up its own mind about guilt or innocence
86554 it is to be expected given the nature of the proceedings
86555 its everybodys desire for the trials to be as open as possible
86556 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
86557 we clearly are looking at an afghanistan where results are mixed the challenges are certainly significant and wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
86558 in every case homosexual practice is considered sinful something that breaks our relationship with god and harms our wellbeing
86559 it is something for which one should repent and seek forgiveness and healing which god is ever ready to do
86560 when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal
86561 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government

86677 but beyond a good english accent a key advantage is the fact that the philippines is a young nation if we start educating filipinos now it will pay off profitably in the future

86695 design should be accessible to everybody it should not be something that you venerate in a museum but something you can use
86696 living in france freed me to be myself to discover who i am and express it to the fullest design is about being honest with myself before i would do projects that were client oriented and i would look at the magazines and propose an idea now its all about me
86697 in france artists are called createurs the idea has to come from you thats what im trying to teach when im in the philippines many are lacking in individuality big cities in france celebrate culture and creative people who do new things and make you feel it

86703 you have a team full of players who are used to having the ball in their hands at the end of the game and getting a lot of touches you have to be able to manage that part and make each player feel like theyre going to get the ball and score even though theyre not

86721 the whole concept of a parallel fashion week is completely vague and its main aim is to fragment the fashion body and not strengthen it
86722 commercial interest is the only possible reason for holding this parallel event
86723 a parallel fashion week will not do any good to the fraternity because all the designers and buyers are same
86724 when nothing new is coming up from this event then what is its purpose and what good it will do to the fashion fraternity
86725 we will be more than happy to host another event only if this third front is promoting new talent and getting new buyers
86726 we see this whole event as if somebody is going out of the family just to prove his point
86727 this big step will have massive effect on the sales and the quality of the shows this is not a good move
86728 a parallel fashion event is more of a commercial thing whereas fdci is a non profit organisation and is meant for the productivity of designers only
86729 i cannot be a part of that fashion week it is not possible for me to be a part of so many fashion events
86730 fdci is 10 year old body and we all have grown with it so it does not make any sense to participate in any commercial event
86731 there is no harm in organising another fashion event but the dates should not have clashed we all would have loved to be a part of it what sumeet nair is doing will benefit him more than it benefits us
86732 we would have welcomed this event only if he would have done it like chivas or seagrams fashion week

86737 i just had to go out there and throw strikes and thats what i did and it went well
86738 i dont like to see the game get stopped because of something like that
86739 i cant control it what am i going to do but my reaction out there led to something and i dont like it i felt bad
86740 i think the umpires did a good job taking control of the situation i wasnt worried about hats but i saw a couple balls flying on to the field and thought it was a dangerous situation
86741 there were some things we dont want to see people throwing things on the field all that kind of stuff
86742 it almost cost us the game it was good that it stopped but everyone was on their feet yelling and cheering it kind of sparked us
86743 if this is how fun its going to be we have a lot to look forward to
86744 i walked to the field like six times and all six times i was wrong
86745 bullpen makes a good manager and today i was pretty bad i was making the wrong decision every time i went to the field
86746 i dont want to get myself in trouble but its just one of those things ive never been a part of
86747 it was a little disappointing to be out there with a 1 2 count on a guy and to have to come and sit but im not going to use it as an excuse i ended up walking him
86748 that was probably some of the best stuff ive had all year i was able to keep the ball down
86749 in my eyes its the biggest one weve had all year
86750 i dont know exactly how it all worked out but im happy it did
86751 hes going to bring another element to our offence its going to be a great addition i think everyones looking forward to getting him out there tomorrow and letting him do his thing
86752 youre not allowed much leeway when you pitch against a guy like webb
86753 you really have to pitch near perfect baseball to beat him thats always a good challenge but you know youve got to put up zeros the most frustrating thing was getting a one run lead and giving it back on 10 pitches
86754 the rest was my part thats the game right there
86755 getting into the heads of these characters was kind of an ordeal the actions of the comedian are brutal sometimes
86756 this is stuff thats a little different than anything i have ever done and it was stuff that i had a hard time with
86757 yeah yeah its there its tough thats a tough thing i think that scene and the other scene were two things that ill forever remember as an actor
86758 now war is over mr eddie now i must talk with you
86759 well thats unfortunate because thats just what im gonna do

86881 our findings suggest but cannot prove that people diagnosed with sleep apnea should be treated and if cpap is the prescribed treatment regular use may prevent premature death

87001 you almost feel like you have to pitch almost a perfect game
87002 i thought webb had better command than he did in arizona even though he pitched pretty darn good there
87003 we battled and we had our chances but we couldnt cash in
87004 its a continuing problem and the bill is only going to get bigger
87005 i noticed while i was reading the affidavit that the escape had occurred 6 1 2 hours earlier and i was shocked
87006 this cries out for a comprehensive external investigation because the highest law enforcement officer in the county should not be under any suspicion of illegal activity at any time ever
87007 if they are telling the truth in this matter they come across as two fellows completely out of their element a pair of country bumpkins loose in the big city and unable apparently to tell the difference between a room full of hookers and a tupperware party

87014 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
87015 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
87016 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
87017 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
87018 they did an awesome thing holding him in there because if not what would have happened

87025 the skyrocketing fees of stars is the only problem that is affecting the film industry
87026 the demand for entertainment in india is inflexible it may sound ironical but it is a fact that when the economy is down the demand for entertainment grows and for a good reason
87027 cinema is the cheapest form of entertainment inflation doesnt affect it at all it is bad content that affects a films box office collections

87031 o generation see ye the word of the yahweh have i been a wilderness unto israel a land of darkness wherefore say my people we are lords we will come no more unto thee can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number
87032 for the yahweh hath turned away the excellency of jacob as the excellency of israel for the emptiers have emptied them out and marred their vine branches the shield of his mighty men is made red the valiant men are in scarlet the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken the chariots shall rage in the streets they shall justle one against another in the broad ways they shall seem like torches they shall run like the lightnings
87033 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation

87038 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
87039 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
87040 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign

87044 sometimes you think maybe does it have something to do with the economy as bad as it is but i talk to people who come in to play the games
87045 they have chosen to go out of the city limits
87046 i definitely can tell its because of the smoking ban
87047 i think that our people are just very very frustrated that theyve lost a freedom or a choice to run their business the way they want
87048 we think they should have the choice it shouldnt be forced upon them by the local government
87049 i just wish all these people who said we need a smoking ban because of health reasons would come were not seeing the nonsmokers coming in wed love to have those nonsmokers but theyre not coming in

87092 in my mind mr newman made a stupid and inappropriate comment and perhaps in the future he will be more careful about what he chooses to say
87093 i have received numerous emails today expressing disgust at what mr newman said and i would point out that many of these have been sent by men concerned at the nature of the comments

87126 the fundamental reason why consumers upgrade to pay tv is to enjoy a better choice of content
87127 no one is better placed than us to persuade free to air homes to make that switch that is why we continue to invest in and build on our core proposition as the home of content people love
87128 the outlook is more challenging than it has been for some time

87133 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
87134 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad

87140 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
87141 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
87142 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
87143 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

87151 i always personally hope that its basically an olympics about sports but if it isnt going to be sports well be ready for news
87152 the reason why i have not talked about these things until now is because im the person who had to continually deal with chinese officials at the highest levels about being open about stuff
87153 i always felt id be much more effective as a dealer or a negotiator for things like that if i was doing it quietly

87163 the negative outlook reflects both the potential impact of weaker credit conditions in nabs core geographies as well as ongoing dislocations in credit markets
87164 the ratings outlook is reflecting trends that may affect a rating over the next 12 months
87165 the nab outlook is reflecting the increasingly challenging conditions that weve seen in international markets including in wholesale funding markets
87166 australian banks on average have one of the very highest ratings around the world
87167 there are very few banks globally that would be aaa that would not be government related
87168 as we indicated national australia bank is coming up toward the weak end of its ratings range in a number of categories
87169 were obviously expecting that other banks will make provisions as they come up to their reporting season given that there have been a number of impaired accounts that have been highlighted and delinquencies in the consumer sector seem to be picking up slowly

87176 in plaats van een fles wijn gaat de klant naar een karaf huiswijn een maaltijd in een klassiek restaurant wordt vervangen door een in een bistro
87177 mijn buur doet restauratie ik snacks dus ze komen bij mij dat is in ieder geval nog positief
87178 onze wafeltjes zijn redelijk duur omdat we die zelf maken die verkopen nu minder goed hetzelfde voor lasagne en spaghetti
87179 croque monsieurs lopen dan weer als een trein want die zijn veel goedkoper
87180 maar hoe dichter we het einde van de maand naderen hoe minder drinkgeld ze krijgen dan betaalt iedereen gepast aan het begin van de maand moet ik nog een pak kleingeld in voorraad hebben maar op het eind niet meer
87181 daarmee hebben we een nieuw cli nteel aangetrokken mensen hebben dergelijke formules graag dan weten ze wat ze kwijt zijn aan een restaurantbezoek
87182 we lopen op dat vlak al op het scherpst van de snee om de consument te behouden als je dan ook nog eens radicaal je prijzen aanpast dreig je jezelf uit de markt te prijzen
87183 ik heb net een brief gekregen van interbrew mijn leveranciers hebben hun prijzen met 5 procent verhoogd eigenlijk moet ik hen volgen maar ik durf het niet uit vrees dat mijn volk wegloopt misschien moet ik iets minder groenten leggen of een croque beleggen met twee halve plakjes kaas in plaats van twee hele

87185 door de stijgende kosten brokkelt de winstmarge steeds sneller af we hadden binnen de horeca al heel wat bedrijven die over de kop gingen als de economische terugval nog lang duurt zullen het er nog meer zijn

87189 anywhere else it would be a cause of embarassment if not a modicum of shame
87190 but to a country where a convict ancestry gives you aristocratic status the revelation that the australian prime minister is descended from not just one felon but six is a source of delight
87191 kevin rudd has already boasted of having convicts on both sides of his family an absolute pedigree as he has called it but theres no higher pedigree than counting in your ancestry a thief a forger and a highway robber aged 11
87192 about 160 000 convicts were deported from britain to australia between 1788 and 1868 often for relatively minor offences and their role in the development of the country is now embraced with a rebellious pride it is estimated that more than two million australians are able to boast of at least one convict ancestor and it is such a badge of honour that not having a convict in the family is now a source of embarassment
87193 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
87194 without a reshuffle the administration would only keep losing strength this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
87195 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post

87211 digital images whether theyre from a digital camera or scanner are all about information your goal is to capture as much tonal color and detail information as possible

87219 as any working travel photojournalist will tell you access is a huge part of the equation
87220 taking the photographs is easy for me the real test is getting the locals to accept you to let you into their world and to be comfortable in front of your camera
87221 they crowded around the bar and thought it was fantastic to see themselves and their village on a slide show
87222 they were won over by the excitement and immediacy of the images and by the vibrant color and rich detail that seemed to jump right off the 4 inch screen
87223 the people were extraordinary with classic peasant faces living in a kind of grimms fairy tale world that no longer even exists in western europe

87236 our aim is to ensure everybody living and working in the east of england has an improved quality of life
87237 we are pleased that the government has recognised that skills are essential to the health of the economy in terms of raising peoples aspirations and increasing opportunities
87238 investment in skills will enable the regions businesses to compete in a global economy
87239 transport is also a key priority for the region as it unlocks productivity and the region needs to make a strong business case for investment to address congestion and bottlenecks
87240 one of the hardest things i have had to do is to help carry her coffin to her grave and see it lowered into the ground
87241 there are so many events that we will now never get to see like meeting the young man that she would have chosen to be her partner giving her away at her wedding
87242 i know other families have losses some even have the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child but to lose a child to murder shakes ones faith in humanity
87243 the thoughtless and selfish act took tania from us forever and put an end to a bright future
87244 what was to happen only a week later would shatter our lives forever
87245 i have had to endure a journey of hell frustration and pain a searing pain that still this day rips through my body
87246 i will live with the pain and heartache for the rest of my life it is a mothers worst nightmare
87247 this should never have happened nothing has been achieved by her senseless death
87248 there is a hole in my family a hole that can never be filled
87249 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
87250 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
87251 without a reshuffle the administration would only keep losing strength this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
87252 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
87253 reforms that put a stress on consumers and ordinary people as well as the importance of revitalising the economy
87254 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
87255 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
87256 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
87257 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
87258 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
87259 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
87260 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
87261 that will up to individual companies to make decisions on whether they wish to take that pathway
87262 however the location of the derailment and the surrounding terrain are posing some difficulty for recovery efforts

87279 i did 150 hours of community service in one year as a graduation requirement at my jesuit high school i didnt think my liberty was being trampled on at all
87280 is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery i know not what course others may take but for me give me liberty or give me death
87281 we are of opinion that the provision in the fifth amendment to the constitution declaring that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation is intended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the p 251 government of the united states and is not applicable to the legislation of the states we are therefore of opinion that there is no repugnancy between the several acts of the general assembly of maryland given in evidence by the defendants at the trial of this cause in the court of that state and the constitution of the united states this court therefore has no jurisdiction of the cause and it is dismissed
87282 he would see that these goals are met by among other things attaching strings to federal education dollars if you dont make the kids report for duty hes essentially telling schools and college kids youll lose money you cant afford to lose in short hell make service compulsory by merely compelling schools to make it compulsory
87283 obama will establish a new american opportunity tax credit that is worth 4 000 a year in exchange for 100 hours of public service a year

87289 i know what other people did but i can handle it
87290 you can borrow money from me with no strings attached and you can also get a break on paying me back money you would otherwise have to pay me but if you want to do that one too i want you to do some work for me which i will vastly overpay you for

87296 volunteerism is good but why does every good thing need to be orchestrated by government most people think that churchgoing is a good thing does that mean the government should fund churches thats what they do in europe and surprise most pews sit empty
87297 want a free education fine we need 2 years for domestic civilian service from you at the end of your college time want free health care great i need you to volunteer at an elder care home etc
87298 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
87299 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
87300 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
87301 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out
87302 the ultimate goal is to find new ways to help people like the armed forces and first responders stay alert and on top of things when they have to be awake for extended periods of time
87303 we have drugs now that can keep people awake but theyre addictive and lose their effectiveness with repeated use this research should help us find methods for maintaining mental acuity that have more specific effects are less addictive and retain their potency
87304 using this gene and other related genes we may be able to find better ways to boost performance for someone like a relief worker whos had to stay awake for six straight days trying to save people trapped by an earthquake
87305 the region has low skills compared to the rest of the country and without investment this gap is likely to grow

87312 methadone kills sensitive leukaemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukaemia blood cells
87313 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
87314 i want to apologise for the past incident with the umbrella
87315 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely than others to become infected with hiv
87316 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
87317 congress will not stand for any backdoor effort by the political appointees to further cripple our nation s ability to respond to vital health and safety concerns
87318 this entire effort is the product of a flawed politicized process that has failed to properly consider the views of experts or the consequences for workplace health
87319 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
87320 my commitment was to withdraw even from literary life and all sorts of public life
87321 it is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence here i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach here
87322 i hope he gets a life sentence there is no death penalty at tribunal but for sure he deserves it
87323 the atlas represents and suggests treatments for various wildlife health disorders and infections that have been reported from various parts of the country
87324 moreover the atlas with over 1 000 photographs also analyses cases of poaching and killings of wild animals by poisoning and other means
87325 it will help scientists and researchers establish possible causes behind the death of a particular animal
87326 it will be available at shops by the end of august
87327 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
87328 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
87329 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
87330 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
87331 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
87332 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
87333 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
87334 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
87335 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
87336 who are open to doing something on the production side
87337 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
87338 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
87339 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
87340 miss hilton was neither asked nor did she give permission for the use of her likeness in the ad and has no further comment
87341 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
87342 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
87343 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
87344 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
87345 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
87346 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
87347 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
87348 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
87349 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
87350 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
87351 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
87352 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
87353 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
87354 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
87355 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
87356 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
87357 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
87358 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
87359 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
87360 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
87361 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
87362 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
87363 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
87364 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
87365 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
87366 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
87367 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
87368 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
87369 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
87370 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
87371 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
87372 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
87373 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
87374 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
87375 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
87376 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
87377 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
87378 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
87379 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
87380 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
87381 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
87382 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
87383 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
87384 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
87385 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
87386 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
87387 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
87388 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
87389 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
87390 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
87391 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
87392 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
87393 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
87394 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
87395 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
87396 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
87397 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
87398 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
87399 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
87400 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
87401 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
87402 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
87403 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
87404 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
87405 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
87406 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

87466 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
87467 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
87468 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
87469 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
87470 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
87471 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
87472 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
87473 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

87480 then we better get after finding some supplies of oil and gas
87481 since the 19th century we in the west have been trying to extract oil from the vast oil shale riches that lie under our feet it s no easy task and past efforts have failed miserably commercial oil shale development would require not only immense financial investments but also an undetermined quantity of scarce water from the colorado river basin and the construction of several multibillion dollar power plants

87501 whereas slavery in america resembled no other form of involuntary servitude known in history as africans were captured and sold at auction like inanimate objects or animals

87504 lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow
87505 it is crucial to realize that such slaves were being treated essentially as animals a fact symbolized by their ritualistic slaughter and the final cannibal feast this behavior dramatizes the point that wholly apart from later economic functions slaves from the very beginning were perceived as dehumanized humans humans deprived of precisely those traits and faculties that are prerequisites for human dignity respect and honor
87506 compared the teaching of slaves unlike that of free workers with the training of wild animals

87564 shes enjoying every moment of their romance but shes not ready to get hitched again
87565 and thats why you are the one person i dont want to know
87566 i would like it if you felt you could tell me anything but
87567 im not a good person i make myself sick sometimes
87568 i cant stop thinking about it lately its over and done but i cant understand why i did what ive done i just
87569 after everything youve done for me its the least i can do
87570 and thats why you are the one person i dont want to know
87571 im not a good person i make myself sick sometimes
87572 i cant stop thinking about it lately its over and done but i cant understand why i did what ive done i just
87573 after everything youve done for me its the least i can do

87580 it was really cute first heather proposed to carolyn then carolyn proposed to her
87581 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
87582 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you who doesnt want to be there
87583 its obvious from anything you see or hear he doesnt want to be here leaving him here would have been a problem because you dont know what youre going to get

87587 this dying and resurrecting motif is one of a number that various writers and scholars have claimed demonstrate jesus to represent not a
87588 until they bring to an end the objective situation of sin
87589 this decision properly speaking is not a sanction or a penalty nor is the minister of the holy communion passing judgment on the persons subjective guilt but rather is reacting to the persons public unworthiness to receive holy communion due to an objective situation of sin
87590 taking communion should be a conscious decision based on a reasoned judgment regarding ones worthiness to do so
87591 the practice of indiscriminately presenting oneself to receive holy communion merely as a consequence of being present at mass is an abuse that must be corrected
87592 we may vary in our beliefs but we are all equal in the eyes of god respect for each others belief is democratic space and we must respect separation of church and state including political beliefs
87593 the church should not capitalize on our faith i believe even god wont tolerate such act refusing communion
87594 it probably wants poverty to thrive more in the country
87595 focus more on issues to lessen the impact of surging prices of commodities
87596 only former congressmen who have joined the oppus dei will receive communion although the bishops warning will not affect the others because of their sexual preference
87597 atheism not religion is the real force behind the mass murders of history
87598 the crimes attributed to religion while ignoring the greater crimes of secular fanaticism
87599 in the name of creating their version of a religion free utopia adolf hitler joseph stalin and mao zedong produced the kind of mass slaughter that no inquisitor could possibly match collectively these atheist tyrants murdered more than 100 million people

87606 declarations must avoid judgments or evaluation about religion i promise that next time a speaker judges a religion or a religious law or document i will interrupt him and pass on to the next speaker
87607 there is something rotten in the state of this council
87608 it is very concerning in a council which should be the guardian of freedom of expression to see constraints or taboos or subjects that become taboo for discussion
87609 it is difficult for me to accept that a council that is the guardian of legality prevents the presentation of serious analysis or discussion on questions of the evolution of the concept of non discrimination
87610 will amount to spreading hatred against certain members of the council
87611 the council is not prepared to discuss religious questions and we dont have to do so declarations must avoid judgments or evaluation about religion
87612 as long as a statement made with restraint from making a judgement or evaluation of a particular set of legislation which is not in the point of our discussion the speaker may continue

87649 the concern back then was that he was the wrong man at the wrong time but there were not many options and national elections soon followed he was second in command in the party kadima so it had to be him

87651 livni clearly has the advantage as she is leading in the national polls but this is not a national election its an internal primary one and mofaz although playing the underdog has a decorated military past he was defence minister and chief of staff of the idf and that appeals to many within the party they are pretty much neck and neck
87652 this of course means no real progress can be achieved on that front but they are not halted in fact the israelis and syrians are scheduled to meet via the third party turkey next month again but that has always been a long process
87653 waarom omdat we parano de zijn en deze dreigingen al jaren geleden anticipeerden en hebben opgelost door onze binaries digitaal te tekenen en alleen onze updater de door ons getekende binaries te laten installeren ik denk dat de andere vendors de memo niet hebben gekregen
87654 myth could not be demonstrated by rational proof its insights were more intuitive similar to those of art music poetry or sculpture

87656 on the other hand shake off all the fears and servile prejudices under which weak minds servilely crouched fix reason firmly in her seat and call to her tribunal every fact every opinion question with boldness even the existence of god because if there be one he must more approve on the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear
87657 reason tells me that my faith in what wikipedia tells me is justified because such things have been or can be scientifically demonstrated by technical experts with the proper equipment my faith in what wikipedia tells me can be backed up by evidence
87658 plant is medicinal 3 there is a book written by their ancestors that says the
87659 kierkegaard does not suggest that belief is not rational but rather it is not just a rational act
87660 consider a group of catholic theologians who meet on wednesday afternoons to discuss metaphysical questions these people use a number of curious words and expressions such as essence ground of being grace dialectic and so on yet the discourse in progress clearly is not arbitrary but rule guided a beginner who uses an expression incorrectly is reprimanded and may even be ostracized if he or she does not conform within the group it is well known who are the experts whose pronouncements are listened to with most respect and so on here we could propose is a language game it is a rule guided activity and probably being religious is a form of life within this language game words and expressions have a use which is circumscribed by rules and conventions on wittgensteins later theory of meaning therefore we must surely say that these words and expressions have meaning and that the metaphysical discourse is to its game players at least meaningful
87661 we hopen ook dat jullie objectief verslag doen van wat jullie hier zien

87667 i just want to get on with my life and move on from this
87668 reproducci n de salmonidos para pesca deportiva en san mart n de los andes argentina
87669 if you write something like that dont you have to take responsibility
87670 i came out of it like i hoped to everything is on track
87671 were putting in 25 30 plays each practice and it takes a while to get that continuity and that rhythm
87672 my expectation was that we were going to improve every day and weve improved in a lot of ways
87673 i wanted to be better than we were when we got here and we are
87674 were pushing ourselves through a lot of things that can be distracting whether were tired were sore some guys are hurt some guys are taking every snap thats what football is
87675 you train yourself for the season during training camp this is where you get tougher as a team
87676 your leaders have got to do it and theyve got to bring everyone with them i think were doing a very good job of that
87677 were still battling through some things but thats the way its going to be
87678 when the clock started to tick more so yesterday than at any other time in the process i lost a little of my optimism
87679 marginal amount of benefit ill grant you we did look at fuentes situation much differently
87680 usually a lefthander with a plus breaking ball tends to have success
87681 i really dont believe any of us were fixated on who we might trade for or anything like that
87682 i think well maintain the same approach going out there to win that days game
87683 i think with what theyve accomplished youre starting to see day in and day out theyre very much capable of doing it
87684 if you cant go full speed dont go if the quarterback cant get his timing we cant win as a football team theres no compromising on effort
87685 i think linehan and saunders just wanted to send a signal that hey this is not an acceptable way to practice no matter how sore you are no matter how hot it was
87686 some guys are hurt some guys are taking every snap thats what football is you train yourself for the season during training camp you cant do that during otas you cant even begin to do that this is where you get tougher as a team
87687 everybodys pretty lively and theyve got a lot of spunk to them but you get to this time you kind of find out what people are made of this is where you develop that and your leaders obviously have been through it theyve got to bring everybody with them
87688 no matter how much working out you do in the summer leading up to camp its just tough to get back in that football condition
87689 its kind of a give and take with the weather and the turf
87690 its not real hot here but it does pound you a little hard on that turf grass is definitely more forgiving
87691 i wish i knew what it was so i could stop doing it
87692 its a struggle im not going to say i had my best stuff but i think i had good stuff to pitch im not executing im not pitching the way i should be i let my team down i let myself down hopefully i go out with my next start and turn it around i need to for me and for the team it hasnt been good times lately
87693 he showed what hes capable of on the plus side hes also making some mistakes more of the good less of the bad and get a better outcome
87694 im healthy im pitching thats all i need to know
87695 whatever decisions they make are upstairs or with tony and dunc thats the last thing on my mind as long as im healthy i know im going to be pitching somewhere
87696 ive been bad i cant put it in other words
87697 i havent been executing yeah theres a couple starts that have gotten away that i have couldve gotten a win but my job is to go out there and give the team a chance to win
87698 i think he gets distracted i dont know if the five inning theory is correct or not
87699 but in the end since this is a league where you either do or you dont youve got to do whatever the reason i think that was one thing he could concentrate on
87700 when a pitcher gets a base hit in the middle of the plate on a fastball with a runner in scoring position on the first pitch you wonder if he was concentrating and focusing as much as he should
87701 baby baby i get down on my knees for you
87702 i love football no matter how hard it is no matter how sore i am i love it and im going to have a good time at it
87703 hey chris and i i think we have a pretty big future in show business if this whole football thing doesnt work out dont you
87704 his whole family came out and that made it just that much better
87705 paparazzi the gifts fancy cars the playboy mansion you feel like a superstar
87706 if youre going to give me stuff and take me to disneyland you can call me mr anything you want and ill go with it
87707 they call him mr irrelevant and theres all this stuff about me being no 2 but were just alike weve got the same motivations the same goals and i think hes doing a great job
87708 and he just happens to be from the greatest college institution in the country so hes got an advantage
87709 coach is definitely going to have to sit down and tell me some idaho stories
87710 there are guys that have made it in this league even pro bowlers it didnt matter how they got here but once they got here they took advantage of it you never know
87711 is a real smart football player and very adaptable hes catching our eye
87712 hes got a football mentality instinctive almost a throwback type guy
87713 dave lights up a room hes a lot of fun to be around its amazing you get to know a lot about all these guys personalities before you even know what kind of football players they are
87714 his philosophy in life is why do something if you cant have fun doing it
87715 i remember when he was real young and hed go out to the front yard to play basketball with his dad
87716 i hated that because hed get so upset if he lost hed be so mad at himself
87717 it kicked my butt but im really thankful that i did it
87718 just making a 53 man roster no matter where youre drafted is tough
87719 i know my role is special teams and to make plays as well as know all the linebacker positions so i have the versatility to step in if they need me making the team is what its all about thats the main goal
87720 twenty four hours ago this wasnt close it came together very quickly the player has too much of a great impact on our lineup to pass on for any reason with somebody like manny you cant say no to that
87721 i thought there would be more movement on thursday not only with our club but other clubs
87722 i think he was ah i think he was just a little surprised maybe
87723 its a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
87724 ken griffey jr was a big part of this franchise for a long time this a beginning of a new era i guess
87725 their goal is to paint me as the bad guy
87726 one of the best righthanded hitters of his generation if not all time
87727 omg blogher is coming up i never went back to register

87731 that only takes 10s and 20s but muni doesnt take bills and bart doesnt take bills so i ask you again w t f
87732 no problem no lumps or anything no reason to worry and then theyll have a point of reference when i start going at 40
87733 actually my doctor didnt request it the radiologist requested it they just called to tell me to come back
87734 yeah but they still have to send us the orders
87735 sigh the radiologist just sends your doctor the report if it says there should be more scans your doctor still needs to
87736 but that means shes on the other side of the equation making it more likely statistically that you wont be ok
87737 but im not a doctor so the radiologist needs to look at it to be sure
87738 monkey see monkey do children learn the best as they are doing
87739 as we are facing difficulty with the direction of the economy including rising raw material prices although there are relatively few japan led factors we need to address this issue
87740 also we need to restructure the countrys economic system in response to structural changes from an ageing society and a declining birthrate
87741 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
87742 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
87743 and jesus said come to the waters stand by my side i know you are thirsty you wont be denied i felt every tear drop when in darkness you cried and i strove to remind you that for those tears died i know most of the words but i am trying to find the whole song and possible music
87744 the father the son and the holy spirit for me please
87745 there is something exciting about trying to recall the name of the person next to you in bed or better how to escape out the window without waking them these are the precious moments we cherish which lead up to the infamous walk of shame
87746 some said the rebates would not have an impact well they were wrong
87747 the stimulus checks are having an impact in spite of the energy prices
87748 provides one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economic picture

87857 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god
87858 in the large olympic arenas there was an elevated seat on which the judge of the contest sat after the contests were over the successful competitors would assemble before the bema to receive their rewards or crowns the bema was not a judicial bench where someone was condemned it was a reward seat likewise the judgment seat of christ is not a judicial bench the christian life is a race and the divine umpire is watching every contestant after the church has run her course he will gather every member before the bema for the purpose of examining each one and giving the proper reward to each
87859 for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing

87864 if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
87865 his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
87866 and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh
87867 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church
87868 let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god

87895 where there is no revelation the people cast off restraint
87896 if people cant see what god is doing they stumble all over themselves but when they attend to what he reveals they are most blessed
87897 i will make you into a great nation and i will bless you i will make your name great and you will be a blessing i will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you i will curse and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you
87898 moses my servant is dead now then you and all these people get ready to cross the jordan river into the land i am about to give them to the israelites i will give you every place you set your foot as i promised moses joshua 1 2 3
87899 the spirit of the lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the lords favor
87900 now get up and stand on your feet i have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what i will show you i will rescue you from your own people and from the gentiles i am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me
87901 there was the true light which coming into the world enlightens every man 10he was in the world and the world was made through him and the world did not know him 11he came to his own and those who were his own did not receive him 12but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god even to those who believe in his name 13who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
87902 there was the true light which coming into the world enlightens every man
87903 while you have the light believe in the light so that you may become sons of light
87904 he was in the world and the world was made through him and the world did not know him 11he came to his own and those who were his own did not receive him
87905 this is the judgment that the light has come into the world and men loved the darkness rather than the light for their deeds were evil
87906 but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god even to those who believe in his name 13who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
87907 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear not on our watch
87908 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word
87909 well youre the majority so how could you be discriminated against
87910 it isnt just hillary clinton who needs to learn a lesson from this primary season its all the people who crossed the line and all the women and men who let them get away with it
87911 well create a new sanction for interracial couples and leave the marriage issue to the churches
87912 clinton is a woman far from feminism her covering and being a beard for billy the goat had nothing to do for feminism that i can see of course there is sexism that is differnt than being sexually oppressive

87914 good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
87915 why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments
87916 thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness 19honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
87917 all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet
87918 if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me
87919 what good thing must i do that i may have eternal life
87920 sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved
87921 in the ninth chapter of genesis god promised noah that would never happen again and the sign of the promise is the rainbow
87922 i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men

87929 when turning to the book of revelation from the rest of the new testament one feels as if he or she were entering a foreign country instead of narratives and letters containing plain statements of fact and imperatives one comes to a book full of angels trumpets earthquakes beasts dragons and bottomless pits
87930 as it is written eye has not seen nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for those who love him but god has revealed them to us through his spirit for the spirit searches all things yes the deep things of god
87931 do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them

87942 ill vote for obama because we need a democrat in the white house
87943 the best way that we can stand up for you is to make sure we have a democratic president taking the oath of office on jan 20 2009
87944 seen his passion his determination his grace and his grit
87945 there are a lot of folks still on the sidelines trying to make up their minds
87946 if were going to have a president that respects unions
87947 theres quite a few of us on the fence im not the only one a lot of her supporters are there
87948 right now obama is saying shes low on the list well decide what to do if he doesnt choose her
87949 i was thinking she would win and she slid back and i was really disappointed
87950 i definitely want to see a democrat in the white house
87951 he wasnt my first choice but thats the choice now
87952 she stood strong and tall and im glad shes supporting barack obama
87953 she has integrity and shes a lady of her word
87954 they have to focus on electing a democrat mccain is not union friendly
87955 if youre electing him youre putting bush back in the white house
87956 the proposed indictment of the sudanese leader by the icc prosecutor is an inappropriate decision made at an inappropriate time
87957 it will seriously undermine the mutual political trust and cooperation between the un and the sudanese government
87958 inevitably came under intense criticism from many countries represented by important international organizations
87959 china is of the view that icc indictment of the sudanese leader will only derail the process for resolving the darfur issue and even render useless all the efforts made so far for the proper settlement of the issue
87960 china supports the reasonable request by the african union and other organizations for the council to take early measures in accordance with the relevant provisions to suspend iccs indictment of the sudanese leader
87961 exxon like most of its peers is facing an uphill battle maintaining let alone growing its oil and gas production
87962 stock fell thursday not so much due to the earnings but rather because of the market and the fact that the entire oil sector traded down in response to the decline in crude prices
87963 this is the best addition that has been made since ive been here
87964 i havent played with him in four years but he is a tremendous teammate he is as good as anyone out there hopefully we can take advantage of it
87965 i had a thought something was going to happen but i had no idea manny was the guy
87966 i was first brought into this around 10 a m and then i cam to the ballpark
87967 manny in the middle of the lineup certainly gets peoples attention
87968 i think hes not only going to be a big plus for us but i think hes going to make guys around him a lot better its not going to be easy in some pitchers minds to go through this lineup
87969 i dont think theres a downside lets just see what happens
87970 it makes you yearn for the dh i just dont know whose playing time it will affect
87971 our intent is to win the american league central division and ultimately to win another world series championship
87972 adding a player the caliber of ken griffey jr gives us a better chance to realize those goals
87973 griffeys addition gives manager ozzie guillen more flexibility ozzie has the opportunity to field his best team offensively and defensively on a day to day basis over the next two months and this gives us the chance to keep some of our middle of the order hitters fresh and producing down the stretch i spoke with ken and he is excited to be coming to chicago to try and help us reach the postseason
87974 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
87975 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute

87979 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
87980 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
87981 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
87982 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
87983 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
87984 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
87985 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
87986 if there is probable cause to believe that somebody has committed a crime
87987 then it is not problematic to investigate that person that that person happens to be investigating or purporting to investigate
87988 is not problematic it may be ironic or curious it is not problematic
87989 the mission independence and very existence of the office of special counsel are and shall remain at risk
87990 i was appointed by the president and confirmed unanimously for a five year term that term ends on january 5 2009
87991 as you may already be aware the president very recently declined an invitation to dismiss me
87992 at least according to news accounts i will note your concerns and will take them under advisement as i consider the remaining few months of my term
87993 took an unauthorized state paid trip to washington d c after the interstate 35w bridge collapse
87994 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
87995 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
87996 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
87997 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
87998 foreign students like to stay out all night on the weekend but in more intellectual and traditional chinese households there is no way the kids would go out like that
87999 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
88000 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
88001 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
88002 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
88003 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
88004 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
88005 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
88006 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
88007 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
88008 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
88009 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
88010 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
88011 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
88012 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
88013 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
88014 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
88015 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
88016 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
88017 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
88018 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
88019 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
88020 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill

88026 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
88027 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
88028 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
88029 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
88030 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
88031 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
88032 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
88033 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
88034 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
88035 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
88036 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
88037 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
88038 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
88039 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
88040 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
88041 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
88042 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
88043 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
88044 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
88045 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
88046 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
88047 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
88048 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
88049 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
88050 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
88051 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
88052 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
88053 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

88110 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
88111 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
88112 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
88113 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
88114 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
88115 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
88116 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes

88120 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
88121 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
88122 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
88123 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
88124 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
88125 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
88126 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
88127 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
88128 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
88129 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
88130 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
88131 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance

88133 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
88134 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
88135 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
88136 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
88137 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point
88138 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
88139 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
88140 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
88141 its enormous size made the bomb impractical for warfare purposes

88147 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
88148 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
88149 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
88150 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
88151 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
88152 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
88153 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
88154 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
88155 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
88156 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
88157 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
88158 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
88159 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
88160 my business is my life and im ok with that
88161 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
88162 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
88163 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
88164 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
88165 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
88166 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies

88168 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
88169 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
88170 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
88171 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
88172 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
88173 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
88174 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
88175 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
88176 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
88177 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
88178 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
88179 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
88180 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
88181 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
88182 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
88183 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
88184 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
88185 in america you are not playing the race card when you acknowledge a very visible fact trollneequa commented on
88186 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
88187 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
88188 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
88189 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
88190 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
88191 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
88192 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
88193 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
88194 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
88195 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
88196 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
88197 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
88198 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
88199 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
88200 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
88201 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
88202 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
88203 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
88204 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
88205 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
88206 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
88207 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
88208 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
88209 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
88210 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
88211 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
88212 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
88213 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
88214 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
88215 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
88216 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
88217 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
88218 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
88219 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
88220 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
88221 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
88222 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
88223 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
88224 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
88225 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
88226 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
88227 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
88228 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
88229 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
88230 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
88231 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
88232 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
88233 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
88234 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
88235 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
88236 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
88237 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
88238 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
88239 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
88240 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
88241 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
88242 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
88243 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
88244 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
88245 the voters we need to get are people not a whole unlike obama
88246 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
88247 are you better off now than you were four years ago
88248 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
88249 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
88250 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
88251 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
88252 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
88253 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
88254 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
88255 if the vice president says its do able i believe
88256 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
88257 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
88258 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
88259 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
88260 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
88261 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
88262 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
88263 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
88264 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
88265 the best use of talents and experience i have gained in my life is to expand the political space in which these members and politicians address the climate crisis
88266 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
88267 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
88268 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
88269 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
88270 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
88271 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
88272 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
88273 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
88274 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
88275 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
88276 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
88277 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
88278 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
88279 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
88280 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
88281 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
88282 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
88283 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
88284 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
88285 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
88286 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
88287 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
88288 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
88289 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
88290 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
88291 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes
88292 can you trade it for one to two drinks per day and be fine
88293 they help increase good cholesterol or hdl high density lipoproteins and clean the circulatory systems pipes
88294 hdl helps remove fatty deposits created by bad cholesterol or ldl low density lipoproteins from blood vessel walls the higher the hdl the less likely vascular disease becomes the lower the hdl the more likely
88295 you shouldnt even think about doing it until age 45 or 50 theres absolutely no proof of a preventative and protective effect before age 45
88296 a lot of people still have an affinity for john mccain
88297 they voted for him once and he might be able to take advantage of that
88298 some jobs that have left michigan are not coming back
88299 are really moderate republicans theyre pro choice their hairstylists are gay they dont get worked up about teaching evolution
88300 obama will have to go in himself and build his own machine
88301 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
88302 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
88303 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
88304 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
88305 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
88306 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
88307 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
88308 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
88309 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
88310 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
88311 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
88312 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
88313 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
88314 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
88315 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
88316 temperature records show that the arctic was in fact warmer in the 1930s and 1940s than it is today
88317 2007 winter sea ice extent at both poles reached record highs
88318 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
88319 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
88320 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
88321 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
88322 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
88323 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
88324 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
88325 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
88326 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
88327 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
88328 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
88329 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
88330 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
88331 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
88332 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
88333 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
88334 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
88335 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
88336 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
88337 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
88338 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
88339 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
88340 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
88341 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
88342 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
88343 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
88344 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
88345 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
88346 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
88347 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
88348 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
88349 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
88350 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
88351 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
88352 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
88353 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
88354 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
88355 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
88356 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does

88359 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
88360 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
88361 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
88362 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
88363 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
88364 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
88365 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
88366 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
88367 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
88368 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
88369 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
88370 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
88371 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
88372 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
88373 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
88374 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
88375 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
88376 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
88377 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
88378 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
88379 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
88380 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey

88384 the most priceless experience of this years festival for me so far will not be a potential madonna sighting or even moores always entertaining film introductions it will be experiences like one i had last night as i watched a young candidate for memphis city council george watch himself for the first time in a documentary in which he starred especially getting red faced and laughing when in the film he noted that being good looking was certainly an asset to running for office also inspiring was the eager questioning by young people in the audience about how they can get involved in the political process

88404 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
88405 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege

88486 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
88487 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
88488 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
88489 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
88490 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
88491 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
88492 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
88493 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
88494 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
88495 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
88496 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
88497 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
88498 whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself

88512 it looks like the other broadcasters are using the wall to wall olympics coverage in daytime as an excuse to be mischievous and overly competitive
88513 it all seems a bit overly competitive of them to move kids across to bbc2 for the olympics and then shorten the blocks as well for no key reason apart from wanting to boost bbc2s daytime ratings
88514 all the additional programmes on bbc2 are repeats rather than key shows that they wouldnt have been able to take a break from
88515 the olympics happen once every four years and lasts for two weeks
88516 it generates huge interest in britain this year it is also the games which hands over the london 2012 games which will be of particular interest to audiences
88517 a number of other big sporting events like the world cup and wimbledon have similarly aired on bbc1 daytime and it is complete nonsense to suggest that we have changed the schedule for any other reason than that we believe it is of interest to both adults and childrens audiences

88527 locking children up is not the answer to youth crime
88528 young people especially those with mental health problems need to be provided with the right assistance to ensure they get better
88529 whilst there has been some investment in mental health services in the youth justice system there needs to be support for parents and their children from the whole spectrum of childrens services
88530 when a child does enter the youth justice system all staff need be trained and aware of mental health problems to help recovery and reduce offending in the long term

88597 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
88598 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
88599 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
88600 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
88601 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
88602 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
88603 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
88604 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
88605 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad

88607 robbie keane really wanted to come to us and i think he is going to bring us an enormous amount hard work goals and experience
88608 he will bring the level of the team up a notch and im sure he is going to be very important this season he has a proven record
88609 keane has great mobility and versatility he can play on the wing or a bit behind the striker i think it is very good for the team to have a player who can get in between the oppositions midfield and defence and score goals hes quick and clever and i think he will really help us
88610 but the tactical lay out of the team and whether or not we are going to play two up front is down to rafa when he signed keane he had a very clear idea of where he wanted to play him

88630 he had a real strong stance of the treaty as far as the tribal government protecting treaty rights
88631 its like a fading and dying ambition in our tribal leadership
88632 you know he was a treaty man he always wanted to protect treaty rights
88633 he was a very strong traditional person he had his own strong belief in values and always treated everyone with respect and regard
88634 he was always up front and said whatever he had to say
88635 he had a good sense of humor and was held in high regard by all the tribal community in the goldendale area
88636 he used to come over all the time and sing with our family
88637 nachdem wir von journalisten ber probleme bestimmte internetseiten zu ffnen informiert wurden haben wir sie unverz glich gegen ber dem organisationskomittee bocog angesprochen
88638 offensichtlich werden die probleme nun gekl rt uns war immer zugesagt worden dass journalisten ausreichende arbeitsbedingungen h tten ihrer arbeit nachzugehen der ioc vorstand wird sich bei seinen konferenzen ab samstag nicht speziell mit der angelegenheit befassen sondern allenfalls im rahmen der allgemeinen unterredung zum stand der vorbereitung
88639 das bedeutet dass die zensoren sehr bewusst ausgew hlt haben welche seiten sie ffnen um dem ausland gegen ber ein zeichen zu setzen
88640 mehr oder weniger klar ist sie zumindest ein schritt nach vorn ich hoffe dass die freigabe dieser informationseiten nicht nur f r die zeit der spiele gilt sondern auch danach anh lt und dass dann das internet v llig ge ffnet wird
88641 sie bef rchten offenbar dass ich wenn ich in die stadt fahre kontakt zu ausl ndischen politikern aufnehmen will die zur er ffnung der spiele kommen
88642 im excited nervous sick to my stomach eager i get anxious when i think about how close it is

88645 these old cars they have personality they were built pretty tough
88646 theyll talk to you from noon until dusk about what theyve done to their car
88647 the only time youre done with a car is when you sell it to somebody else
88648 i just love cars theyve been a part of my life all of my life
88649 our whole thing is to brag about what we have were proud of what weve got and were not afraid to talk about them
88650 i just want to apologize to the community the business owners i didnt mean to hurt anybody

88656 wir sind ganz normale leute nur eben mit einem intelligenzquotienten ber 130 es ist aber nicht so dass hier lauter kleine einsteins rumlaufen
88657 ich bin auf der suche nach intelligenten gespr chen und erfrischungen f r den kopf es ist selten so dass wir generell f r alles begabt sind sondern wir sind bei bestimmten themen besonders schnell und kommen auch besser in komplexe themen rein

88664 viele f hlen sich irgendwie anders und unverstanden wissen aber nichts von ihrer hochbegabung
88665 wir bieten in einer sehr konzentrierten form eine geballte menge an wissen an entsprechend der schnellen auffassungsgabe der hochintelligenten

88684 im good at being uncomfortable so i cant stop changing all the time
88685 transformation contains both change and stability plurality and unity movement and constancy it has the nature of life namely to connect organically the polar opposites the stumbling blocks of logic and to unite them in an all embracing rhythm
88686 in the truest sense freedom cannot be bestowed it must be achieved
88687 declare d the united colonies free and independent states absolved from allegiance to or dependence on the crown or parliament of great britain
88688 order without liberty and liberty without order are equally destructive
88689 freedom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err
88690 we must be free not because we claim freedom but because we practice it
88691 we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars
88692 if you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable you disconnect yourself from what you truly want and all that is left is compromise
88693 when you have to make a choice and dont make it that is in itself a choice
88694 meditation brings wisdom lack of mediation leaves ignorance know well what leads you forward and what hold you back and choose the path that leads to wisdom
88695 remember there are no mistakes only lessons love yourself trust your choices and everything is possible
88696 i chose and my world was shaken so what the choice may have been mistaken the choosing was not you have to move on
88697 there are two primary choices in life to accept conditions as they exist or accept the responsibility for changing them
88698 quality is never an accident it is always the result of high intention sincere effort intelligent direction and skillful execution it represents the wise choice of many alternatives
88699 there is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself
88700 every human has four endowments self awareness conscience independent will and creative imagination these give us the ultimate human freedom the power to choose to respond to change
88701 it is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
88702 life is not a continuum of pleasant choices but of inevitable problems that call for strength determination and hard work
88703 always write angry letters to your enemies never mail them
88704 we must make the choices that enable us to fulfill the deepest capacities of our real selves

88720 los servicios m nimos establecidos carec an de toda justificaci n

88722 los servicios m nimos se fijaron de forma unilateral y solicitaba

88724 i am a great believer in luck and i find the harder i work the more i have of it
88725 a mother is the truest friend we have when trials heavy and sudden fall upon us when adversity takes the place of prosperity when friends who rejoice with us in our sunshine desert us when trouble thickens around us still will she cling to us and endeavor by her kind precepts and counsels to dissipate the clouds of darkness and cause peace to return to our hearts
88726 mums not the word when it comes to mine lt 3
88727 a mother is not a person to lean on but a person to make leaning unnecessary
88728 god knows that a mother needs fortitude and courage and tolerance and flexibility and patience and firmness and nearly every other brave aspect of the human soul
88729 there is a great deal of poetry and fine sentiment in a chest of tea
88730 my mom is a neverending song in my heart of comfort happiness and being i may sometimes forget the words but i always remember the tune
88731 the moment a child is born the mother is also born she never existed before the woman existed but the mother never a mother is something absolutely new
88732 she told me she was coming back to my place afterward
88733 this was a relationship dominated by the defendants jealousy and paranoia
88734 he tried to have total control over her life but when she tried to leave he would not and could not relinquish that control
88735 he couldnt carry on a conversation if you killed someone accidentally that you cared for you would have not been able to think straight either
88736 for me poetry is an evasion of the real job of writing prose
88737 learn and grow all you can serve and befriend all you can enrich and inspire all you can
88738 a writer is after all only half the book the other half is the reader and from the reader the writer learns
88739 he who asks a question is a fool for five minutes he who does not ask a question remains a fool forever
88740 theyre dumping it at mostly dollar theaters the second run theaters so itll make even less money
88741 if you get the right incident the american public will support

88743 as a major country with a historical and strategic depth in the midst of the afro eurasia landmass turkey is a central country with multiple regional identities that cannot be reduced to one unified category in terms of its sphere of influence turkey is a middle eastern balkan caucasian central asian caspian mediterranean gulf and black sea country all at the same time
88744 i dont think these people have a clue what they are causing
88745 this is a drop in the bucket there are 50 plus sites like this in the yakima valley
88746 as we drive around we see this again and again
88747 the biggest impact to the local economy is tree fruit it helps everyone have a job
88748 from the guy at the mini mart to the orchardist every industry is dependent on tree fruit
88749 the past few years we are finding more and more and getting closer to the commercial area
88750 i want to get people to understand how to solve these problems

88784 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
88785 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
88786 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
88787 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
88788 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
88789 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
88790 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
88791 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up

88801 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
88802 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
88803 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream
88804 it was extremely inspirational to have him here before the game so soon after the surgery we played really hard tonight it wasnt always easy but we found a way to win it good football teams find a way to win
88805 this year we are winning some of the close games
88806 i think it just shows the leadership we have on the football team and the belief we have in one another we are a better football team bottom line we dont beat ourselves and in years past we probably have a little bit when you have all three phases of the game playing well you are probably going to come out on top
88807 offensively we got away a little bit from what worked for us in the first half
88808 we just werent making the plays we should have made we had drives that were going and then we had dropped balls or bobbled snaps what could go wrong went wrong for us in the second half

88865 the harming of an animal is just something that no one that i know finds in any way something that they would want to do
88866 its very important to us that cfd get it as far as the animal abuse because what cfd does will have a major impact on the rest of the rodeo world
88867 so what were saying is look lets find a way lets find a way to work together

88913 i think there is actually very strong bipartisan support for lifting the ban
88914 prices at the pump are hurting an awful lot of people in this country and this is a way of getting some of that money back in their pockets so that we can keep the economy moving

88919 although biofuels still account for only 1 5 percent of the global liquid fuels supply they accounted for almost half of the increase in consumption of major food crops mostly because of corn based ethanol produced in the united states
88920 i think it highly unlikely that we would be back in any foreseeable future
88921 one hundred thousand acres makes sense anything added right now is outside of our budget

88931 while there is little to no relationship between the price of gasoline and development of natural gas on public lands which is what most of this development has been about as opposed to oil our rush to produce short term energy supplies can have a profound effect on the fish and wildlife habitats and water supplies that define the west

88945 i dont know what to take out of this match
88946 theres always going to be a nothing match these type of matches what are you going to do i just tried to serve well it wasnt an olympics or a us open so i can live with that
88947 maybe i got a little bit unlucky on a couple but he definitely served well in the last tiebreaker when i had three chances on second serves i wasnt able to get one when i really needed to be on even terms with him
88948 i guess that cost me the match which is hard to accept
88949 hes doing well and i have done well in the past as well

88958 but focusing on the gloom has left us unprepared for many of the largest problems we face which are not the product of failure but of success

88960 legitimacy allows one to set the agenda define a crisis and mobilize support for policies among both countries and nongovernmental forces like private business and grass roots organizations american ideals still dominate the debates over darfur iranian nuclear weapons and burma but washington needs to understand that generating international public support for its view of the world is a core element of power not merely an exercise in public relations

89010 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter
89011 we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
89012 we are well prepared since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions
89013 we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
89014 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control
89015 we have ordered six new boeing 777 300er aircraft for delivery beginning in 2010 they are 23 per cent more fuel efficient than the boeing 747 400 and give us additional flexibility in the long haul fleet
89016 im pleased to say that talks towards a merger with spanish carrier iberia are under way this is good news for both airlines our shareholders and our customers
89017 the potential benefits are significant we can build on our successful ten year relationship with increased efficiencies synergies and an excellent network fit
89018 it will be several months before talks are finalised but we are confident of securing regulatory approval
89019 our talks with american airlines and iberia towards further co operation are progressing well
89020 despite the difficult situation the industry is in we remain absolutely focused on the interests of our customers
89021 its just going to get funnier and funnier as the evening goes on

89026 without a reshuffle the administration would only keep losing strength this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
89027 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
89028 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
89029 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
89030 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
89031 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
89032 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
89033 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
89034 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods

89063 we are working on equipping our troops because i think the mission and the purpose of the mission has great importance in as far as the lives of people who are affected in darfur are concerned
89064 its not good to just keep saying if there isnt this am going away because that would belittle the importance of the mission i dont think that is what anybody intends to do
89065 one is what could be provided by the un using the countries that have means
89066 what we did was we linked it with karenzis indictment
89067 first of all we have a problem with the indictments in a general sense but also with the un a body we belong to that should try to be fair to all its members and which is behind the establishment of the ictr international criminal tribunal for rwanda
89068 they listen or base their decision on what a french or spanish judge is saying about somebody from a member country before they put them to work that itself is strange and we made this clear to them
89069 we the 100 national and international ngo members of acbar express our grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
89070 but we need the continued support of ngos and the international community if we are to prevent further suffering
89071 it is imperative that they remain committed to afghanistan the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the un alone
89072 especially the increasing use of suicide bombings and other indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas and the use of civilian property from which to launch attacks
89073 are mounting an increasingly vigorous systematic terror campaign of threats abductions and executions aimed against members of the civilian population
89074 searches conducted by afghan and international forces have on some occasions involved excessive use of force extra judicial killings destruction of property and or mistreatment of suspects
89075 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date

89077 climate model simulations are unable to replicate such cold tropical conditions for this time period
89078 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
89079 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
89080 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
89081 the evidence we found indicates that glaciers were common at this time even in tropical latitudes
89082 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
89083 mars is giving us some surprises were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from
89084 one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
89085 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
89086 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale

89117 no disrespect to mike williams i love mike williams but he is going to have show people that he is really serious about playing football said running back lendale white a usc teammate
89118 unfortunately they might be talking about him like ryan leaf as one of the worst draft decisions
89119 were ready to move from sports and olympics to news the moment something really serious happens here
89120 i always personally hope that its basically an olympics about sports but if it isnt going to be sports well be ready for news
89121 the reason why i have not talked about these things until now is because im the person who had to continually deal with chinese officials at the highest levels about being open about stuff

89132 he who made monsters the life and art of jack pierce
89133 its an animal study and its a relatively small sample
89134 its very interesting but putting genetic type research like this into context is quite difficult at the early stage it can offer up great potential but when you then go to humans and when you then go to trained humans the potential may not be there
89135 this has been an extraordinary rewarding and collaborative effort by leading international researchers which heralds real progress in our understanding of these devastating disorders
89136 the next step of the research will be to understand why there is an excess of rare chromosomal structural changes and to identify which genes are most critical in the development of the disorder
89137 no one has ever managed to isolate these neurons from a patient and grow them in a dish
89138 now we can make limitless supplies of the cells that die in this awful disease this will allow us to study these neurons in a lab dish and figure out whats happening
89139 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
89140 our study now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons
89141 this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind the disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
89142 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
89143 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
89144 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
89145 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
89146 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater
89147 we were pinning our hopes on the process of carbon dating the latest information were getting is that for the period were looking at its not going to be possible to give us an exact time of death the indications are that if the results come back the same way as they have now it is obvious there wont be a homicide inquiry
89148 we cannot get away from the fact that we have found the remains of at least five children there but at the end of the day there just might not be the evidence to mount a homicide inquiry in an attempt to bring anybody to justice
89149 it seems strange that we have lots of bones but an announcement that there will no longer be a murder investigation
89150 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
89151 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
89152 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
89153 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
89154 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
89155 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
89156 it is during lift off the spacecraft will be under the most stress
89157 we want to ensure the lunar reconnaissance orbiter can withstand the extreme conditions experienced during launch
89158 these initial observations from ostm jason 2 compare very closely to those of jason 1
89159 to be able to collect such high quality science data within a month of launch breaks previous records it is also a direct reflection of how mature the field of satellite altimetry has become and of the seamless cooperation of our international team
89160 with the large number of u s and international missions focused on the moon this is absolutely the right step forward
89161 we are extremely proud of our status as the first nasa lunar science institute affiliate outside of the united states
89162 we look forward to working with our colleagues throughout the institutes organization and at the canadian space agency conducting this world class research
89163 the moon has been earths cosmic partner for the last four billion years
89164 it is an honor to move forward in partnership with the canadian science community in this next phase of scientific exploration of the moon
89165 we are tremendously excited by the enthusiasm shown for the iln and lunar science more broadly
89166 this international activity will greatly extend scientific knowledge of the moon in a number of important areas
89167 scientific coordination of the international armada of missions being sent to the moon in the next decade will greatly leverage our scientific capabilities and perhaps even more importantly develop the next generation of lunar scientists
89168 this mission provides nasa with a unique opportunity to evaluate how our nanosatellite spacecraft and its payload perform while demonstrating our ability to conduct fast turn around low cost spaceflight projects
89169 this collaborative mission has enabled nasa to demonstrate and support cutting edge technologies
89170 we have an experimental payload loaded into an experimental satellite onboard a privately developed vehicle
89171 were thrilled with this opportunity to combine our solar sail experience and technology with a new way of doing business
89172 digital maps that support turn by turn vehicle guidance need to be highly accurate and detailed
89173 many road attributes such as turn restrictions or other restricted maneuvers are more efficiently collected or verified via in vehicle processes other elements such as small physical barriers can only be collected and verified by geographic analysts on the road
89174 because all of our map collection verification and production processes are standardized against a common database specification customers can more quickly and easily integrate new quarterly coverage and content into their navigation systems
89175 as we add more content and broaden attribute verification end users can receive improved routing benefits through the system providers map update programs
89176 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
89177 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
89178 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument
89179 during the next few years the vast array of lakes and seas on titans north pole mapped with cassinis radar instrument will emerge from polar darkness into sunlight giving the infrared instrument rich opportunities to watch for seasonal changes of titans lakes

89188 did obama accuse mccain of running a racist xenophobic campaign
89189 hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
89190 the second quarter result is primarily influenced by high oil and gas prices our record earnings are also coming as a result of operational focus contributing to high production
89191 our equity production increased 6 from the second quarter of 2007 mainly due to new capacity both on and outside the norwegian continental shelf ncs and higher gas offtake a number of our fields will undergo planned turnarounds in the next quarter in total we are on track to deliver on our 2008 production ambition
89192 we are also satisfied with our exploration results this year in the first half of 2008 we have completed a total of 49 exploration wells out of which 18 have been declared as discoveries for the full year we plan to drill at least 70 wells

89373 i have studied for forty years and they are so many years wasted i teach others and am myself ignorant of everything this state of things fill my soul with such humiliation and disgust that life is intolerable to me i have been born into the world i live in time and i know not what time is i find myself in a point between two eternities as out sages say and i have no conception of eternity i am composed of matter and i can think yet i have never been able to learn what produces thought i know not whether my understanding is a simple faculty within me like that of walking or of digesting food and whether i think with my head in the same way as i grasp with my hands not only is the essential cause of my powers of thought unknown to me but that of my movements equally obscure i cannot tell why i exist yet i am questioned every day on all these points and i have to answer i have nothing to say worth hearing but i say much and after talking i remain confused and ashamed of myself

89386 i got exactly what i wanted out of the deal the true facts of the situation
89387 i feel a lot better knowing that under oath nelson said that during dallas nba finals games in 2006 that he was meeting with golden states gm and helping the warriors work on their draft plans
89388 unfortunately according to the arbitrator because i held back about 25 000 in consulting payments as i tried to understand the situation i am obligated to pay him the deferred money he was to be paid basically i pay him the exact same amount i would have paid him had this not happened
89389 not so much a legal defeat for cuban as it was an old fashioned ass whuppin
89390 its a good day im relieved it ended the way it did i didnt think i would lose and i didnt think he would win but you just never know when you go to court
89391 it was kind of a silly case its like a pimple on his behind for cuban but 6 plus million is a big number for me i dont feel like ive won the lottery because ive already earned that money but its good to know im going to get it
89392 its not the way i wanted this to go i wanted to be the red auerbach of the dallas mavericks after coaching but thats not what cuban wanted the good news is all this has forced me to continue coaching and im really enjoying working with mully warriors vice president of basketball operations chris mullin and being back with the warriors im having fun again and thats the way it should be its all working out great and ill probably end up doing something in a franchise patriarch role like i thought i was going to do in dallas

89417 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals

89419 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
89420 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
89421 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public

89433 but india has good forensic laboratories and experts in different parts of the country to deal with emergency situation
89434 robbie wie ist ihre pers nliche meinung zu der reifenproblematik die am vergangenen wochenende in indianapolis aufgekommen sind
89435 ich kann aus meiner sicht nichts anderes sagen als dass nascar gro en wert drauf legt f r fans und fahrer gro artigen rennsport zu bieten die basis dazu ist jedoch dass wir auch in der lage sind ein sicheres rennen durchzuf hren in indianapolis lagen ungl ckliche und au ergew hnliche umst nde vor so dass wir die sicherheit und die durchf hrung des rennens unter einen hut bekommen mussten
89436 herausgekommen ist dabei ein ganz anderes format als wir alle in indianapolis eigentlich sehen wollten das rennende war sicherlich sehr spannend aber insgesamt war es alles andere als ideal wie wir uns gegen ber den fans vor dem fernseher und an der strecke pr sentiert haben aber wir werden dieses problem l sen k nnen
89437 durch den sieg von jimmie johnson ist michael schumacher mit seinen f nf indianapolis siegen dort nach wie der erfolgreichste pilot aller zeiten aber in der nascar selbst hat deutschland derzeit keinen fahrer w re nascar denn berhaupt an einem deutschen nascar piloten interessiert zum beispiel wenn sich ein michael schumacher pl tzlich dazu entschlie en w rde in der nascar zu fahren
89438 nat rlich deutschland hat im motorsport einige gro artige champions hervorgebracht auch die motorsportgeschichte deutschlands ist genauso gro wie die der usa oder anderer wichtiger m rkte und auch nascar steht mittlerweile ganz anders da als noch vor zehn jahren
89439 heute wird die motorsportwelt ziemlich von der formel 1 und der nascar bestimmt in der formel 1 gibt es nur wenige cockpits und diese cockpits sind mit ganz wenigen ausnahmen auch nur f r ein paar jahre reserviert zumindest sicherlich nicht so lange wie sich ein fahrer w nschen w rde in seiner gesamten karriere aktiv zu sein
89440 wenn man sich also ansieht was die optionen f r die piloten sind die auf dem h chsten wettbewerbslevel agieren wollen die vor einer sehr gro en publikumsmenge fahren wollen und die das ganze hochprofessionell betreiben wollen dann wird nascar immer attraktiver das sieht man an leuten wie montoya villeneuve carpentier franchitti aber auch an einem marcos ambrose
89441 ich sage nicht dass wir das alles schon zu 100 prozent erreicht haben aber die realit t ndert sich rapide wir hatten schon einen klaus graf der bei uns seine duftmarke hinterlassen hat aber er ist sicher nicht von einem kaliber wie es etwa ein michael schumacher darstellt dass es einmal einen deutschen fahrer in der nascar geben wird das steht f r mich au er frage die frage lautet also wann und nicht ob
89442 durch sehr popul re ehemalige formel 1 piloten wie juan pablo montoya oder jacques villeneuve hat nascar auch in deutschland einen unglaublichen aufschwung erhalten wie betrachtet nascar den neuen stellenwert der serie au erhalb der usa speziell in deutschland
89443 es ist uns sehr wichtig den deutschen motorsportfans etwas zu bedeuten weit dar ber hinausgehend als dass man sich einfach nur gerne gro e amerikanische events ansieht aber wir m ssen auf dem deutschen markt erst einmal eine relevanz bekommen und um auf dem deutschen markt eine relevanz bekommen zu k nnen brauchen wir einen deutschen top piloten der auf dem h chsten level mitf hrt das ist sicherlich absolut kritisch um der nascar auf dem deutschen markt eine wirkliche relevanz zu bescheren
89444 man muss sich nur einmal daran erinnern was boris becker f r das tennis brachte oder eben michael schumacher f r die formel 1 vielleicht nicht in der gleichen dimension denn in diesem fall g be es ja keinerlei lokale events aber sicher w re dies ein ereignis das f r nascar und den deutschen markt das spiel ganz neu aufstellen w rde
89445 boris becker und tennis ist ein gutes beispiel denn in deutschland gab es ja nie viele wirklich wichtige tennisturniere und becker hat dem tennis in deutschland trotzdem einen riesigen boom verschaffen k nnen welche neuen erkenntnisse hat nascar denn aus dem gestiegenen ausl ndischen interesse gezogen oder generell gefragt wie wichtig ist der rest der welt f r nascar
89446 extrem wichtig wie jedes andere business will auch nascar wachsen und mehr fans bekommen unsere internationale fangemeinde ist noch nicht besonders gro aber sie ist schon wesentlich gr er als noch vor ein paar jahren wir fangen nun wirklich damit an immer mehr fans aus den verschiedenen teilen dieser welt zu bekommen
89447 man muss sich nur irgendein business ansehen und fragen was es bedeutet 100 000 oder eine million neuer kunden generieren zu k nnen wir wissen dass sich unsere internationale fangemeinde im millionenbereich befindet vielleicht noch nicht im bereich von ber zehn millionen aber im millionenbereich und wenn man eine million neuer kunden gewinnen kann dann ist das f r jedes gesch ft sehr wichtig
89448 in sachen business sind bereits einige gro e deutsche konzerne wie adidas siemens oder henkel im bereich nascar sponsoring aktiv w nscht sich nascar denn auch eine beteiligung gro er deutscher automobilhersteller wie bmw mercedes audi oder porsche die dem beispiel toyota folgen k nnten
89449 wir laden jeden herzlich ein und unser system war dazu auch immer offen f r alle hersteller solange ein betreffendes auto theoretisch auf einem normalen stra enauto basiert und auch in den usa hergestellt wird im fall toyota mussten wir die japaner daran erinnern was ein vergaser ist und sie dazu bewegen den staub darauf abzuwischen denn so etwas haben sie wahrscheinlich vor vielen jahren zum letzten mal gebaut
89450 aber wenn man sich nicht nur in sachen fahrer den deutschen markt ansieht dann befinden sich die deutschen hersteller unter den gr ten und bedeutendsten marktteilnehmern im bereich automobilbau generell w rden wir eine st rkere teilnahme der deutschen im amerikanischen rennsport sehr begr en ob das nun in sachen nascar ist oder etwa auch in der grandam serie
89451 ich glaube dass darin eine gro e gelegenheit f r porsche mercedes bmw audi oder vw versteckt liegt sich den us markt von der sicht des rennsports aus viel intensiver anzusehen als sie es derzeit machen im prinzip sind sie ja berhaupt nicht vorhanden porsche und bmw werden durch ein paar privatteams vertreten mercedes und vw sind berhaupt nicht pr sent audi mit ausnahme der alms ebenfalls
89452 aber von einem wirklich bedeutenden standpunkt aus betrachtet sind die deutschen hersteller allesamt nicht anwesend vielleicht mit ausnahme von porsche nascar ist heute nicht mehr nur eine rein nordamerikanische angelegenheit und ich w rde sagen in ihrem sinn und auch im sinne ihrer aktion re sollten sie dar ber noch einmal nachdenken
89453 bmw wird 2009 in der gt2 kategorie der alms antreten
89454 ohne jetzt ber andere serien sprechen zu wollen aber wenn das der einzige plan ist um im us markt eine bedeutende position zu erlangen
89455 jeder der einmal ein nascar rennen vor ort gesehen hat der wei dass das spektakel und das gesamte drumherum mindestens die gleiche dimension wie ein formel 1 rennen hat in europa muss sich jede motorsport serie mit der formel 1 vergleichen lassen wie w rde robbie weiss den deutschen motorsport fans den unterschied zwischen einem nascar rennen und einem formel 1 wochenende erkl ren
89456 ich bin wie wir brigens alle ein gro er formel 1 fan wenn man sich am sonntagmorgen um acht uhr in der nascar garage umsieht dann sitzen die fahrer alle in ihren motorhomes und schauen sich das formel 1 rennen an wir stehen mit der formel 1 nicht im wettbewerb wir sind v llig anders und f r viele menschen die rennsport m gen erg nzen wir uns gegenseitig sogar
89457 die beste art und weise wie ich den unterschied erkl ren kann ist folgendes beispiel wenn man auf ein formel 1 rennen geht dann ist es so als w rde man im smoking mit schwarzer krawatte zu einem event gehen wo alle menschen gut aussehen und champagner trinken nascar hingegen ist wie ein barbecue und man trinkt ein bier
89458 beides ist gro artig aber auch sehr verschieden der eine tritt gerne im smoking auf der andere trinkt lieber bier und viele menschen m gen beides das ist wahrscheinlich der einfachste weg den unterschied zwischen formel 1 und nascar zu beschreiben
89459 the only accessory we needed to bring was a pair of sunglasses
89460 that way we could be looking where we like and get away with it
89461 if you cant stare at them today you can never stare at them they hardly want you to ignore them when they are dressed like that
89462 i have to say theres a sparkle missing and thats the political end of things
89463 the atmosphere was special and i was very disappointed that brian cowen decided to do away with it
89464 ive talked to hundreds of politicians over the years and given my input to them they never did anything for us they just absorbed what we had to say
89465 its like a cross between a cheap wedding and a lousy debs
89466 then they took jesus from caiaphas to pilates headquarters it was early in the morning pilate went out to them

89469 i dont like to see the game get stopped because of something like that
89470 i cant control it what am i going to do but my reaction out there led to something and i dont like it i felt bad
89471 i think the umpires did a good job taking control of the situation i wasnt worried about hats but i saw a couple balls flying on to the field and thought it was a dangerous situation
89472 there were some things we dont want to see people throwing things on the field all that kind of stuff
89473 it almost cost us the game it was good that it stopped but everyone was on their feet yelling and cheering it kind of sparked us
89474 if this is how fun its going to be we have a lot to look forward to
89475 i walked to the field like six times and all six times i was wrong
89476 bullpen makes a good manager and today i was pretty bad i was making the wrong decision every time i went to the field
89477 i dont want to get myself in trouble but its just one of those things ive never been a part of
89478 it was a little disappointing to be out there with a 1 2 count on a guy and to have to come and sit but im not going to use it as an excuse i ended up walking him
89479 im stunned how people arent seeing that with tv in five years from now people will laugh at what weve had

89490 one of the manifestations of mr monks condition was that he became increasingly obsessed about safety on the site in case another accident should happen
89491 carried on as best as he could but inside he was in turmoil and felt scared all the time he had nightmares and at times had suicidal thoughts
89492 in my view he was a secondary victim whose post traumatic stress disorder was caused by witnessing at first hand the immediate aftermath of a fatal accident but who was not himself directly involved in the accident as a participant
89493 in order to be entitled to recover damages from the defendant in these circumstances mr monk would therefore need to satisfy the further conditions imposed as control mechanisms to limit recovery by secondary victims suffolk homes

89498 essentially a hard working public servant who simply wanted to return to work is faced with quite crippling financial consequences
89499 it really shows that unsubstantiated allegations can be exceptionally damaging in that a public servant on his own needs to defend them and incur those costs
89500 basically in the interests of justice to say that mr smiths legal costs and costs associated in defending the matter should be reimbursed in full
89501 the government can do that by way of an ex gratia payment if they chose to do so

89509 senator obamas strength as an orator is his ability to deliver scripted texts in a way that expresses a sense of lived conviction
89510 audiences are unaware that he is delivering from a teleprompter by contrast the audience is painfully aware that senator mccain is using a teleprompter
89511 senator obama does not as readily or as convincingly express empathy in these environments as does senator mccain senator obama seems detached analytic and professorial at times senator mccain has a quick wit
89512 senator obama makes skillful use of history to argue that his candidacy marks a major moment for america his perorations are masterful
89513 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
89514 my friends you know im past the age when i can claim the noun kid no matter what adjective precedes it but tonight we sure showed them what a comeback looks like
89515 i have never believed i was destined to be president i dont believe anyone is predestined to lead america but i do believe that we were born with responsibilities to the country that has protected our god given rights and the opportunities they afford us i didnt grow up with the expectation that my country owed me more than the rights owed every american on the contrary i owe my country every opportunity i have ever had
89516 america can change that is the true genius of this nation what we have already achieved gives us hope the audacity to hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow
89517 america this is our moment this is our time our time to turn the page on the policies of the past our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face our time to offer a new direction for this country that we love
89518 while we continue to pursue every possible option raising the necessary funds to offer fixed interest rate private education loans is taking longer than originally projected and has become even more challenging
89519 as soon as mefa has secured funding we will make education loans available at this time however it remains unclear when mefa will be able to resume its lending activities
89520 this was youre going to africa and sh t is hitting the fan
89521 crafting and producing programming about hiv and aids for a young audience was all very practical very much using marketplace tactics that mtv would employ in designing its regular programming
89522 hiv and aids was coming of age as a health crisis and so was mtv as targeting the portion of the population that was most at risk
89523 by the turn of the millennium which is when i became part of the process of crafting the programs the issue of hiv aids posed an entirely new set of problems
89524 as the disease emerged and people began to gain opinions about it the audience was largely tuning out or growing deaf to it
89525 where i became most involved was trying to figure out how to create that concept of conversation and shape it into content
89526 the whole issue of aids in the developing world became part of the national conscience
89527 the fact that this came from the ground up allowed us to have a touchstone with which to reinvigorate the conversation about hiv aids again as a phenomenon
89528 he presented the material in such a way that his perception of media as a social medium could be applied to many different topics which i thought was one of the strongest points in his speech
89529 the meeting was just to start a series of dialogues trying to hammer out what that vision is so that were all on the same page
89530 i think weve got common agreement on the role that the doc has played in its long history at the college and will continue to play
89531 i look forward to coming to an agreement on a document that reflects that
89532 i really liked the fact that the programs are developed by students and theyre managed by students
89533 the office of outdoor programs provides a good support role in that process
89534 the doc is such a student driven club and student run club that its a huge part of campus
89535 basically were craving for some sort of assurance from the administration that they arent going to change things
89536 from my point of view i dont see it as one meeting or two meetings
89537 it never solves the traffic problem it just puts more cars on the road
89538 in theory if we could control point source and non point source pollution we would have clean water
89539 you look at it and only two seniors out of however many kids that were on our team make it you have to be pretty good to get on there we were the only two from nashua that came here so it feels pretty good going
89540 theres a lot of great athletes on this team and i love being a part of it with them rather than playing against them during the season its nice to have them on my team and hopefully help us to victory
89541 its meant so much to actually see the kids it was an unbelievable experience and helped us to understand what were really playing for
89542 we were surprised to see that the princeton review listed financial aid as an area for improvement at dartmouth especially since we have implemented so many enhancements to financial aid over the past few years
89543 dartmouth has always been one of the most economically diverse institutions of its peers
89544 these initiatives are specifically designed to address our commitment to ensuring that dartmouth remains accessible to all students regardless of their families financial circumstances
89545 we get enough surveys that we believe the bogus ones cancel each other out
89546 there might be one overwhelming happy student and one really miserable one but we can tell from the quotes students provide that they are being honest and giving us really good information
89547 dartmouth rated very highly on the quality of life rating
89548 every day they scream every day all day no it isnt as bad as that but you do get calls every day
89549 normally we do all college work or dartmouth rental housings work it all has to do with dartmouth in one way or another
89550 when students are going through finals we tend to see an increase in furniture problems
89551 we used to do a lot of project type work like go in and remodel some of the college owned apartments but now we do smaller jobs like picture hanging
89552 the bigger stuff goes out to contractors now just because the campus has grown so much
89553 its just the projects that need to be done in the residence halls when you look at the renovations we used to do in the summer they were much more minor in scale
89554 most of the time a good share of us feel that were more of maintenance men than we are carpenters
89555 some of us dont get to show our skills as much as wed like to
89556 im still ghetto thats not going to change im never going to change my culture yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture
89557 we had heard people use brobama around dartmouth and elsewhere
89558 so one day on the metro home from work we decided it would be funny to expand upon the brobama concept in a more substantive way
89559 we thought we might be able to better translate campaign coverage and political news for people our age who might not otherwise be interested
89560 war is real tough and neither obama nor mccain can change that but obama wants to refocus our efforts
89561 but now that its running more or less smoothly we spend about an hour per day on the site and entries plus the time required to keep up with election news
89562 computers arent just for nerds these days they can help a good bro communicate better
89563 the amount of time being spent on mundane implementation work is very high

89566 charter travel gives business travelers the ability to have meetings in multiple cities in a short period of time conduct business en route and enables them to get into more cities and through airports quickly companies also find cost efficiencies for large groups traveling together
89567 the amount of time being spent on mundane implementation work is very high
89568 given the uncertain economy we wanted to see how peoples passions drive behaviour when it comes to travel
89569 the survey results overwhelmingly show that people whose vacations are tied to personal interests intend to continue to travel by taking advantage of money saving resources such as rewards programmes
89570 the amount of time being spent on mundane implementation work is very high
89571 our plan is to build a global product offering and to launch the brand in other european markets the agreement with worldspan is a hugely important milestone as we work towards achieving these goals
89572 the amount of time being spent on mundane implementation work is very high
89573 i think the situation has improved although there is still a lot of scope for improvement irrespective of who implements the pricing and inventory decisions the amount of time currently being spent on mundane implementation work is very high as per a hsmai survey time spent on implementation by rm managers and directors is significantly more than time spent on strategy or customer engagement i think most rm executives can be more strategic with more automated reporting and price inventory implementation
89574 the amount of time being spent on mundane implementation work is very high
89575 at current unprecedented elevated levels fuel prices will negatively impact our margins during the remainder of 2008
89576 economic uncertainty in north america as well as the higher cost of air travel due to record fuel prices is deterring some guests from traveling
89577 the government has been spending way too much promising way to much charging it to our nations credit cards and are leaving it to our children and grand children to pay for it
89578 over the past 3 decades the us economy has gone through 3 recessions according to nber in each of those 3 recessions there was a string of job losses that lasted for a minimum of 10 months

89594 rather than charge the fare necessary to produce their product management has chosen to resort to the tactics of ultra low fare carriers such as allegiant airlines and irish carrier ryanair
89595 this model resorts to a nickel and dime approach to the airlines most valuable asset the passengers flight attendants are trained and certified safety professionals not cashiers to be used in managements futile attempt to bolster us airways bottom line
89596 selling these items detracts from the focus on safety for both passengers and crew while we understand managements intent to add revenue this program will put both flight attendants and passengers in a no win situation proven by the myriad of problems arising from the buy onboard program currently in place
89597 in the current industry of customer frustration the last thing flight attendants want to do is add fuel to the fire

89608 theres a slight possibility in the future if the higher ranked nationwide series wanted to add a road race to the three they already do or switch out one they already have
89609 right now were really happy to have the camping world series the young men who drive in this series are people who youre going to see in the nationwide series and the sprint cup series in the years to come
89610 its a shame because its the kids that are getting screwed
89611 were happy to give them a place to play our dates meshed so it looks like there will be football on every friday night judge is going to have a great team so i hope that takes some of the sting out of it i know its got to be frustrating for judge coach james cordova

89617 wir hoffen dass die bundesschiedskommission der spd den auf landesebene beschlossenen parteiausschluss zur cknimmt

89622 this has always been one of the tougher teams to play against in my career
89623 and so now to be on the other side of that and cause havoc for everyone else is definitely a positive for me
89624 i know that this is deron williams team theres no question about that hes worked to get himself in that position and hes a great player in this league hopefully i can come here and continue to push him continue to make him a better player
89625 ronnie i think has been a great point guard here also i can come in and help him also were going to compete and push each other to try to be the best that we can all be but itll be within the team atmosphere

89737 we came in here and milwaukee was playing really good baseball
89738 i was excited to get up by five in the fourth inning im not going to lie i was excited for the whole group and to take a little pressure off rich
89739 we have baseball to be played in august september but certainly coming in here and beating a good opponent in their home ballpark four times its something to feel good about
89740 i was a little inconsistent with some of my off speed pitches didnt have a great feel for that but i was able to get through it
89741 we have more than 10 guys on the injured list
89742 none have any major injuries hopefully well get the majority of them back at soldier field
89743 hopefully before long we can talk about the practice that he had
89744 its getting closer and closer to of course the first preseason game i just want to get some work done youre tired of watching film and youre not on it
89745 our intent is to win the american league central division and ultimately to win another world series championship
89746 adding a player the caliber of ken griffey jr gives us a better chance to realize those goals griffeys addition gives ozzie guillen more flexibility ozzie has the opportunity to field his best team offensively and defensively on a day to day basis over the next two months and this gives us the chance to keep some of our middle of the order hitters fresh and producing down the stretch i spoke with ken and he is excited to be coming to chicago to try and help us reach the postseason
89747 i was surprised they obviously had a need for a bat in the lineup and another outfielder
89748 i think he griffey was just a little bit surprised when approached about consenting to a trade but he thought about it talked to his family its a good opportunity the sox pursued him and went after him
89749 is more proof needed that kenneth and oswald do not have a clue ive been a fan since i was eight these two morons have just about driven me out well at least i have the savannah sand gnats they at least try and they try damn hard
89750 reports on the radio state that jenks is headed to the big red machine nice going not
89751 hey mark gonzales griffey isnt headed to the white sux espn just reported he turned down the trade probably didnt want to play for their moron manager who could blame him
89752 good luck with that white sox you just gave the twins the title
89753 as for all the cubs fans its no surprise you would come on here and make crude remarks since your trading days are over now and no one wants your left overs it still holds true you only care about the white sox and your binge drinking in the urinal
89754 the cincinnati reds will get infielder danny richar and right handed pitcher nick masset in the deal according to sources cincinnati will also pay the remaining 4 million on griffeys contract
89755 easy to say konerko is on the way out but who would want him with his atrocious stats
89756 however it reminds me of some old cubs teams with great players well past their primes and we know what happened to those teams haha
89757 sometimes i feel bad about being included in the pool of whitesox fans some of you people just dont think before you open your mouths

89766 we havent really discussed it to any great length to the moment i think well probably start to discuss those sorts of things next week
89767 to be fair to those players on our list we need to ensure that the direction we take we let them know as soon as we can

89771 we have to do that because our last game we started really poorly we have to start well theres no greyness in it so therell be pressure in it
89772 were getting some good game time into our younger players and that adds to a little bit of excitement too
89773 the young guys at times i think have inspired some of our older and more experienced players

89785 it contains the best summary of the catholic faith at this moment in time and the catholic faith is what we aspire to and teach each generation has its own best summary we do not consider the catechism of the catholic church to be infallible but neither does the pope one of the first things pope benedict did was to reopen the subject of limbo and he is reworking the part on indulgences and purgatory we are not saying that the catechism of the catholic church is infallible

89849 todd is a good friend but more importantly he is a friend of god ive met very few people in my life who are hungrier for god and will take extended periods of time just to seek him god has entrusted him with an extraordinary outpouring for a reason he can trust him to do whatever he says regardless of the opinions of others he is bold amazingly bold the miracles are legitimate and increasing the church of america has asked for a great revival god wonderfully placed this move in a package that few would have expected just to see if were as hungry as we say we are
89850 a few of us met with todd personally before the service and we found him to be a wonderful individual doris and i had never met him before i explained to him what the ceremony would be like and he agreed i thought that it was interesting when he wanted to change one thing i had written in this document because i could then run a quiet test of his humility and his respect for authority keep in mind that this was todds ministry and todds meeting however he had delegated the leadership of the ceremony to me i suggested that his change was not wise and he immediately accepted my decision we were on the same page in fact we like each other
89851 i know i know i know times are changing and it is time we all reached out for something new that means you too
