50010 but this doesnt really fit into the pkks general strategy pkk attacks are usually in rural areas and target security forces rather than directed at a broad public in the city
50011 i think the bomb was ergenekon at work it was telling us that they are still here
50012 my impression is that this attack was carried out by subcontractors
50013 it looks like it was planned by a group who infiltrated the pkk as an organization the pkk is weakened it has become open to this kind of infiltration

50015 afghanistan the brutal and unnecessary war the media arent telling you about
50016 the line devised by the british was worked by the british colonial officer durand and thus became known as the durand line
50017 fall back men afghanistan is a nasty war we can never win britains commanders ignored every warning that the taliban were the toughest fighters on earth

50052 i guess you just want to be brain dead or die then
50053 idiots and lunatics may be given the right to stand for parliament
50054 what was quite fascinating was that over 90 per cent in each group admitted they knew somebody in their family or friends who had a mental illness which is a remarkably high number we did a similar survey with the general population in 2007 which showed that 67 per cent of general population knew somebody with mental illness so that is significantly higher than that
50055 i think its very concerning that almost 20 per cent of the mps who took part in this survey said that theyd had significant mental health issues particularly stress and depression but what was more worrying was that they were unable to talk to anyone about it because they felt there might be repercussions to them in their jobs
50056 it should be changed because it compares mental illness with things like lunacy and idiocy and it is nothing like that and i think one way of de stigmatising mental illness is to put it at par if you look at winston churchill he described his depression very effectively and very clearly and yet he was a very successful leader
50057 its horrible how can they run a country if they have mental health problems
50058 i dont have a problem with that it is more of their personal problem and they have to deal with it
50059 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one

50077 in 2006 while running for congress harry mitchell pledged to do something about the price of gas
50078 but since harry mitchell went to congress the price of gas has increased 68 percent and what has harry mitchell done for arizonans struggling at the pump not much
50079 im here to offer bipartisan and common sense solutions to our long term energy challenges and make a very very specific appeal to mr mitchell an appeal to sign petitions that will at least permit a vote on energy legislation that will lessen our dependence on foreign sources of oil
50080 recently house speaker nancy pelosi conceded to reporters that the american people support american energy exploration to bring down the price of gas but still she refuses to schedule votes on bills that would allow for more american energy exploration and production
50081 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
50082 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
50083 when primary election candidates make silly charges theyre looking for headlines not solutions
50084 the fact is that harry is leading our country in a new energy direction that promotes domestic production encourages conservation and invests in clean technologies such as solar and wind power
50085 harry raised federal fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks for the first time in more than 30 years is working to extend critical solar energy tax credits to create high quality jobs right here in arizona and voted for use it or lose it legislation that requires oil and gas companies to use their drilling permits now instead of holding on to them until oil prices go even higher

50100 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
50101 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
50102 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
50103 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live

50105 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
50106 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
50107 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

50132 je kunt beter hier zitten dan in peking neem dat van me aan peking is niet al te schoon eigenlijk een uit de kluiten gewassen dorp hier in hongkong ben je van alle gemakken voorzien ik ben er niet rouwig om dat de paardenevenementen hier worden afgewerkt laat mij maar lekker zitten
50133 alleen in seoel en barcelona heb ik ooit in het olympisch dorp gezeten of je op een paar uur rijden of een paar uur vliegen van de spelen zit wat maakt dat uit we zijn nu eenmaal de buitenbeentjes voor roeiers en zeilers is dat niet anders
50134 er zijn twee redenen waarom de paardendisciplines niet in peking worden gehouden ten eerste heeft peking geen paardencultuur alles moest daar nieuw worden gebouwd bovendien zijn de gezondheidseisen daar nog stringenter dan in hongkong dit is traditioneel verbonden met paarden de renbaan van sha tin waar het hippisch programma plaatsvindt ademt paardensport uit tien miljoen euro omzet op een racedag is hier eerder regel dan uitzondering
50135 een tweede punt is dat er politiek achter zit hongkong heeft van oudsher een aparte status in china de toewijzing van de paardendisciplines is een zoethoudertje van de chinese overheid zo van alsjeblieft hier hebben jullie ook een stukje van de spelen nou ik vind het prima
50136 allemaal overdreven gedoe die voorzorgsmaatregelen die sporters nemen om de reis en het verblijf zo aangenaam mogelijk te verwerken lichttherapie waar hebben we het in godsnaam over wanneer je twee daagjes gaat shoppen in new york doe je dat toch ook niet
50137 nederlanders jammeren nogal vaak je w t toch wat je te wachten staat nou dan moet je je gewoon aanpassen zo moeilijk kan het toch niet zijn
50138 was het tijdens andere spelen zoveel beter in barcelona was het s avonds om negen uur ook nog 38 graden en in athene liep je vier jaar geleden van boom naar boom om vooral maar uit de zon te blijven je moet gewoon even de juiste knoppen indrukken om te wennen daarna kun je gewoon aan de slag

50280 as the whole world knows by now thousands of southern negro students are engaged in widespread non violent demonstrations in positive affirmation of the right to live in human dignity as guaranteed by the u s constitution and the bill of rights
50281 in their efforts to uphold these guarantees they are being met by an unprecedented wave of terror by those who would deny and negate that document which the whole world looks upon as setting the pattern for modern freedom

50287 would want to be associated with anybody who would be a party to such things that are stated in that ad
50288 that he allowed the police department to do the things that the paper say he did
50289 a number of people who are well known and whose reputation
50290 we are somewhat puzzled as to how you think the statements in any way reflect on you
50291 you might if you desire let us know in what respect you claim that the statements in the advertisement reflect on you
50292 grave misconduct and improper actions and omissions as governor of alabama and ex officio chairman of the state board of education of alabama
50293 we did that because we didnt want anything that was published by the times to be a reflection on the state of alabama and the governor was as far as we could see the embodiment of the state of alabama and the proper representative of the state and furthermore we had by that time learned more of the actual facts which the ad purported to recite and finally the ad did refer to the action of the state authorities and the board of education presumably of which the governor is the ex officio chairman
50294 any of the language in there referred to mr sullivan
50295 the law implies legal injury from the bare fact of publication itself
50296 general damages need not be alleged or proved but are presumed
50297 punitive damages may be awarded by the jury even though the amount of actual damages is neither found nor shown
50298 mere negligence or carelessness is not evidence of actual malice or malice in fact and does not justify an award of exemplary or punitive damages
50299 where the words published tend to injure a person libeled by them in his reputation profession trade or business or charge him with an indictable offense or tend to bring the individual into public contempt
50300 the matter complained of is under the above doctrine libelous per se if it was published of and concerning the plaintiff
50301 we think it common knowledge that the average person knows that municipal agents such as police and firemen and others are under the control and direction of the city governing body and more particularly under the direction and control of a single commissioner in measuring the performance or deficiencies of such groups praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body
50302 the times in its own files had articles already published which would have demonstrated the falsity of the allegations in the advertisement
50303 the matter contained in the advertisement was equally false as to both parties
50304 there is no legal measure of damages in cases of this character
50305 the first amendment of the u s constitution does not protect libelous publications
50306 the fourteenth amendment is directed against state action and not private action
50307 the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources
50308 injure him in his public office or impute misconduct to him in his office or want of official integrity or want of fidelity to a public trust
50309 when the statements amount to defamation a judge has such remedy in damages for libel as do other public servants
50310 retains and exercises authority to nullify action which encroaches on freedom of utterance under the guise of punishing libel
50311 discussion cannot be denied and the right as well as the duty of criticism must not be stifled
50312 was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people
50313 the maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes may be obtained by lawful means an opportunity essential to the security of the republic is a fundamental principle of our constitutional system
50314 i t is a prized american privilege to speak ones mind although not always with perfect good taste on all public institutions
50315 presupposes that right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues than through any kind of authoritative selection to many this is and always will be folly but we have staked upon it our all
50316 those who won our independence believed that public discussion is a political duty and that this should be a fundamental principle of the american government they recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject but they knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction that it is hazardous to discourage thought hope and imagination that fear breeds repression that repression breeds hate that hate menaces stable government that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones believing in the power of reason as applied through public discussion they eschewed silence coerced by law the argument of force in its worst form recognizing the occasional tyrannies of governing majorities they amended the constitution so that free speech and assembly should be guaranteed
50317 the truth popularity or social utility of the ideas and beliefs which are offered
50318 some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of every thing and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press
50319 in the realm of religious faith and in that of political belief sharp differences arise in both fields the tenets of one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor to persuade others to his own point of view the pleader as we know at times resorts to exaggeration to vilification of men who have been or are prominent in church or state and even to false statement but the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history that in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses these liberties are in the long view essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy
50320 cases which impose liability for erroneous reports of the political conduct of officials reflect the obsolete doctrine that the governed must not criticize their governors the interest of the public here outweighs the interest of appellant or any other individual the protection of the public requires not merely discussion but information political conduct and views which some respectable people approve and others condemn are constantly imputed to congressmen errors of fact particularly in regard to a mans mental states and processes are inevitable whatever is added to the field of libel is taken from the field of free debate
50321 men of fortitude able to thrive in a hardy climate
50322 if any person shall write print utter or publish any false scandalous and malicious 376 u s 254 274 writing or writings against the government of the united states or either house of the congress or the president with intent to defame or to bring them or either of them into contempt or disrepute or to excite against them or either or any of them the hatred of the good people of the united states
50323 doth particularly protest against the palpable and alarming infractions of the constitution in the two late cases of the alien and sedition acts passed at the last session of congress the sedition act exercises a power not delegated by the constitution but on the contrary expressly and positively forbidden by one of the amendments thereto a power which more than any other ought to produce universal alarm because it is levelled against the right of freely examining public characters and measures and of free communication among the people thereon which has ever been justly deemed the only effectual guardian of every other right
50324 is 376 u s 254 275 it not natural and necessary under such different circumstances
50325 that a different degree of freedom in the use of the press should be contemplated
50326 if we advert to the nature of republican government we shall find that the censorial power is in the people over the government and not in the government over the people
50327 in every state probably in the union the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men of every description which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law on this footing the freedom of the press has stood on this foundation it yet stands
50328 i discharged every person under punishment or prosecution under the sedition law because i considered and now consider that law to be a nullity as absolute and as palpable as if congress had ordered us to fall down and worship a golden image
50329 any person who speaks writes or prints of and concerning another any accusation falsely and maliciously importing the commission by such person of a felony or any other indictable offense involving moral turpitude
50330 a form of regulation that creates hazards to protected freedoms markedly greater than those that attend reliance upon the criminal law
50331 for if the bookseller is criminally liable without knowledge of the contents he will tend to restrict the books he sells to those he has inspected and thus the state will have imposed a restriction upon the distribution of constitutionally protected as well as obscene literature and the booksellers burden would become the publics burden for by restricting him the publics access to reading matter would be restricted h is timidity in the face of his absolute criminal liability thus would tend to restrict the publics access to forms of the printed word which the state could not constitutionally 376 u s 254 279 suppress directly the booksellers self censorship compelled by the state would be a censorship affecting the whole public hardly less virulent for being privately administered through it the distribution of all books both obscene and not obscene would be impeded
50332 where an article is published and circulated among voters for the sole purpose of giving what the defendant 376 u s 254 281 believes to be truthful information concerning a candidate for public office and for the purpose of enabling such voters to cast their ballot more intelligently and the whole thing is done in good faith and without malice the article is privileged although the principal matters contained in the article may be untrue in fact and derogatory to the character of the plaintiff and in such a case the burden is on the plaintiff to show actual malice in the publication of the article
50333 it is of the utmost consequence that the people should discuss the character and qualifications of candidates for their suffrages the importance to the state and to society of such discussions is so vast and the advantages derived are so great that they more than counterbalance the inconvenience of private persons whose conduct may be involved and occasional injury to the reputations of individuals must yield to the public welfare although at times such injury may be great the public benefit from publicity is so great and the chance of injury to private character so small that such discussion must be privileged
50334 in such a case the occasion gives rise to a privilege qualified to this extent any one claiming to be defamed by the communication must show actual malice or go remediless this privilege extends to a great variety of subjects and includes matters of 376 u s 254 282 public concern public men and candidates for office
50335 inhibit the fearless vigorous and effective administration of policies of government
50336 dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute or the most irresponsible in the unflinching discharge of their duties
50337 the censorial power is in the people over the government and not in the government over the people
50338 the power to create presumptions is not a means of escape from constitutional restrictions
50339 the showing of malice required for the forfeiture of the privilege is not presumed but is a matter for proof by the plaintiff
50340 the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated
50341 examine for ourselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see whether they are of a character which the principles of the first amendment as adopted by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protect
50342 cavalier ignoring of the falsity of the advertisement from which the jury could not have but been impressed with the bad faith of the times and its maliciousness inferable therefrom
50343 the reference to respondent as police commissioner is clear from the ad in addition the jury heard the testimony of a newspaper editor a real estate and insurance man the sales manager of a mens clothing store a food equipment man a service station operator and the operator of a truck line for whom respondent had formerly worked each of these witnesses stated that he associated the statements with respondent
50344 did not err in overruling the demurrer of the times in the aspect that the libelous
50345 we think it common knowledge that the average person knows that municipal agents such as police and firemen and others are under the control and direction of the city governing body and more particularly under the direction and control of a single commissioner in measuring the performance or deficiencies of such groups praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body
50346 no court of last resort in this country has ever held or even suggested that prosecutions for libel on government have any place in the american system of jurisprudence
50347 reflects not only on me but on the other commissioners and the community
50348 t o argue sophistically to suppress facts or arguments to misstate the elements of the case or misrepresent the opposite opinion all this even to the most aggravated degree is so continually done in perfect good faith by persons who are not considered and in many other respects may not deserve to be considered ignorant or incompetent that it is rarely possible on adequate grounds conscientiously to stamp the misrepresentation as morally culpable and still less could law presume to interfere with this kind of controversial misconduct
50349 charges of gross incompetence disregard of the public interest communist sympathies and the like usually have filled the air and hints of bribery embezzlement and other criminal conduct are not infrequent
50350 i t is manifestly impossible to punish the intent to bring those who administer the government into disrepute or contempt without striking at the right of freely discussing public characters and measures
50351 let it be recollected lastly that the right of electing the members of the government constitutes more particularly the essence of a free and responsible government the value and efficacy of this right depends on the knowledge of the comparative merits and demerits of the candidates for public trust and on the equal freedom consequently of examining and discussing these merits and demerits of the candidates respectively
50352 the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth produced by its collision with error
50353 mere negligence or carelessness is not evidence of actual malice or malice in fact and does not justify an award of exemplary or punitive damages in an action for libel
50354 i charge you that punitive damages as the name indicates are designed to punish the defendant the new york times company a corporation and the other defendants in this case and i further charge you that such punitive damages may be awarded only in the event that you the jury are convinced by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was motivated by personal ill will that is actual intent to do the plaintiff harm or that the defendant was guilty of gross negligence and recklessness and not of just ordinary negligence or carelessness in publishing the matter complained of so as to indicate a wanton disregard of plaintiffs rights
50355 no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the united states than according to the rules of the common law
50356 t his court will review the finding of facts by a state court where a conclusion of law as to a federal right and a finding of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary in order to pass upon the federal question to analyze the facts
50357 as the advertisement made no attacks of a personal character upon any individual and otherwise met the advertising acceptability standards promulgated
50358 as commissioner of public affairs it is part of my duty to supervise the police department and i certainly feel like it a statement is associated with me when it describes police activities
50359 by virtue of being 376 u s 254 290 police commissioner and commissioner of public affairs
50360 when it describes police action certainly i feel it reflects on me as an individual
50361 it is my feeling that it reflects not only on me but on the other commissioners and the community
50362 now that you ask it i would naturally think a little more about the police commissioner because his responsibility is exclusively with the constabulary
50363 the police commissioner and the police force the people on the police force
50364 that the people on our police force or the heads of our police force were acting without their jurisdiction and would not be competent for the position
50365 i would assume that the commissioner had ordered the police force to do that and therefore it would be his responsibility
50366 implicates the police department i think or the authorities that would do that arrest folks for speeding and loitering and such as that
50367 beat somebody up or assaulted them on the streets of montgomery
50368 i still say he is the police commissioner and those men are working directly under him and therefore i would think that he would have something to do with it
50369 i look at mr sullivan when i see the police department
50370 i would just automatically consider that the police commissioner in montgomery 376 u s 254 291 would have to put his approval on those kind of things as an individual
50371 i think if you were the police commissioner i would have thought it was speaking of you
50372 well i thought of his department being charged with it yes sir he is the head of the police department as i understand it
50373 the fact that he allowed the police department to do the things that the paper say he did
50374 the constitution delimits a states power to award damages for libel in actions brought by public officials against critics of their official conduct
50375 for a representative democracy ceases to exist the moment that the public functionaries are by any means absolved from their responsibility to their constituents and this happens whenever the constituent can be restrained in any manner from speaking writing or publishing his opinions upon any public measure or upon the conduct of those who may advise or execute it
50376 a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with 376 u s 254 298 actual malice that is with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not
50377 prosecutions for libel on government have no place in the american system of jurisprudence
50378 statements of this court to the effect that the constitution does not protect libelous publications n one of the cases sustained the use of libel laws to impose sanctions upon expression critical of the official conduct of public officials
50379 m en who injure and oppress the people under their administration and provoke them to cry out and complain
50380 make that very complaint the foundation for new oppressions and prosecutions
50381 the obsolete doctrine that the governed must not criticize their governors
50382 i mperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes if desired may be obtained by peaceful means therein lies the security of the republic the very foundation of constitutional government
50383 where public officials are concerned or where public matters are involved o ne main function of the first amendment is to ensure ample opportunity for the people to determine and resolve public issues where public matters are involved the doubts should be resolved in favor of freedom of expression rather than against it
50384 it does indeed go without saying that an official who is in fact guilty of using his powers to vent his spleen upon others or for any other personal motive not connected with the public good should not escape liability for the injuries he may so cause and if it were possible in practice to confine such complaints to the guilty it would be monstrous to deny recovery
50385 the decisions have indeed always imposed as a limitation upon the immunity that the officials act must have been within the scope of his powers and it can be argued that official powers since they exist only for the public good never cover occasions where the public good is not their aim and hence that to exercise a power dishonestly is necessarily to overstep its bounds a moments reflection shows however that that cannot be the meaning of the limitation without defeating the whole doctrine what is meant by saying that the officer must be acting within his power cannot be more than that the occasion must be such as would have justified the act if he had been using his power for any of the purposes on whose account it was vested in him
50386 to applaud or to criticize the way public employees do their jobs from the least to the most important
50387 under our system of government counterargument and education are the weapons available to expose these matters not abridgment of free speech
50388 the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history that in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses certain liberties are in the long view essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy
50389 a s a matter of either practice or philosophy i do not see how 376 u s 254 299 we can separate an issue as to what is believed from considerations as to what is believable the most convincing proof that one believes his statements is to show that they have been true in his experience likewise that one knowingly falsified is best proved by showing that what he said happened never did happen
50390 it has been determined that the conception of liberty under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment embraces the right of free speech
50391 the effective functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on the force of an informed public opinion this calls for the widest possible understanding of the quality of government service rendered by all elective or appointed public officials or employees such an informed understanding depends of course on the freedom people have to applaud or to criticize the way public employees do their jobs from the least to the most important
50392 sometimes when you stick your finger in the horses mouth to put the bit in doesnt it feel like a vagina

50413 the only business cash usually tries to compete with is his brothers
50414 really ive never thought of them as being in competition with each other all cash sells is donuts bulls place has grown into a full service restaurant i wouldnt think there would be much fighting over customers except at breakfast
50415 yeah but for the crawley boys everything is a competition remember what a great football player bull was in high school he was huge even back then thanks to the steroids
50416 oh yes everybody figured hed get a full ride scholarship to wherever he wanted to go but then he broke his ankle in the state game he never fully recovered from it never even went to college
50417 then little brother cash came along five or six years later and became the star quarterback he seemed unstoppable until one night after a big game when bull took him to a club over in shreveport to celebrate they got drunk and started fighting one of cashs fingers got broken on his throwing hand it healed but he never threw the football quite as well after that cash never forgave his brother for it
50418 so theyre still fighting it out in the business world
50419 but did you hear about cash dumping a box of mice into bulls restaurant
50420 im not surprised bull did everything he could to keep it quiet even i havent told anybody
50421 well yeah but i know youll keep it a secret
50422 one of the cooks spotted several mice in the kitchen during the lunch rush so he ran into the dining room to get bull when he pulled him aside and told him about the mice bull began to usher his customers out of the restaurant
50423 oh no he said he suspected a gas leak he apologized and told them their next meal was free including dessert
50424 yeah if anybody had seen a mouse run across the floor bull would have been out of business
50425 he doesnt know for sure but he cant imagine who else would do that to him
50426 yeah but its no big shock to me neither one of them have any scruples
50427 look im sorry i was stupid i shouldnt have had the gun in the apartment
50428 yeah but you cant just throw it away where is it
50429 ive got it in a safe place dont worry about it
50430 i think i convinced ginger that i had nothing to do with navys death hopefully shell convince the police
50431 good what about the panties they really are yours arent they
50432 i put them in his car to make kayla jealous it was a stupid thing to do
50433 im sorry its not that i dont love you i was just confused about my feelings
50434 but i know youll forgive me just like ill forgive you for the gun
50435 no buts do you want me to forgive you or not
50436 the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society by mary ann shaffer and annie barrows is a delightful and completely satisfying novel set on the island of guernsey in the channel islands my review is posted here

50438 physical variations are natural with women we are putting a limit on acceptable physical variation because of an unsupportable belief that women must exist within a narrower physical range than men

50459 the mayor denies these allegations and if he is reasonably confident that he and the city will prevail in court then he should get his day in court
50460 the mayor has a lot to risk by going to trial

50464 ipos will continue for companies in growth sectors and markets
50465 in many emerging markets the economies are still expanding rapidly as are the earnings for the companies based there this is why the majority of ipos this year are coming from the emerging markets
50466 there were 52 ipos during 2007 and in the first half of 2008 there have been 26
50467 the total capital raised in the first half of 2008 amounted to 8 69 billion compared to 4 83 billion from 33 ipos during the same period last year
50468 issuers are unwilling to launch at lowered valuations and investors are more focused on reducing their equity positions
50469 the big issue is whether they will attract proceeds at the pricing levels they are looking for and its a bit of a disconnect right now between what people think they can get in terms of pricing and what investors are willing to pay for these companies
50470 we could see a flurry of chinese listings in the fourth quarter should market conditions improve
50471 if we had just a little more stability i think wed be seeing more ipos from china but they are being challenged by some of the same issues as domestic companies theyre afraid to go out in an environment where pricing fluctuates significantly from week to week

50473 i have stood by for far too long and watched as our city ran itself into the ground at the expense of reasonable people oriented sustainable growth and planning
50474 beginning immediately after the finalization of the deal bridges will close to all automobile traffic coming into the city cars will only be allowed to leave this will free new yorks streets overnight from the burden of traffic congestion and its associated social ills this ban will affect all vehicles
50475 this is a small inconvenience compared to the relief from the costs of automobiles negative externalities i ask that new yorkers re envision their city as a place that now sustains life in a more human and compassionate way no longer beholden to machines some will have to sacrifice and hand carry or bike the goods from long distances into the city but hey they already do this in the third world are you telling me new yorkers cant rise to this challenge new yorkers can decide for themselves which blocks they want to level in order to clear land to grow the food they dont want to haul in from outside but i do have them covered on consumer goods we will allow donkey carts to ship in frisbees hackey sacks and of course bicycles all priced at rates that cover the back breaking labor and expense of the shipping that should be all they need to be happy
50476 it hasnt gone unnoticed by me that biketopia will still need roads that are safe for cyclists and nice enough to be considered
50477 i know our 21 870 bike commuters are eager to rise to the occasion and help us to build biketopia
50478 schools will immediately start teaching global warming for 7 hours per day they will abolish science particularly the scientific method math and reading since these can be used to challenge the global warming dogma and question our abolishment of automobiles based on shaky environmental rationale instead they will spend the last hour of school teaching kids how to run red lights and stop signs on bikes while speeding the wrong way on sidewalks with no helmets
50479 mtas trains were purchased because they couldnt cover their own operating costs but i recognize that this is a critical component of biketopia so i will immediately double fares so that we are no longer dependant on gas taxes to subsidize this system ridership wont really increase because i will have no more capital to expand the system so most people will switch from cars to bikes biketopia to get around because they are more flexible fun and good for the earth but i will use smoke and mirrors to keep mass transit riders happy i plan to sell ice cream in every third car since the ac doesnt work the train horns will be replaced with that cute jingle that the ice cream truck plays and i will paint them red and white stripes in a candy cane pattern
50480 the nypd will initially have a tough task enforcing the new traffic patterns since bicyclists are vastly more dangerous to pedestrians than cars are but eventually pedestrians will accept the utter supremacy of the bicycle and police can turn their attention to more important tasks associated with biketopia
50481 the nyfy will no longer have trucks so they will all wear new smokey the bear outfits to remind new yorkers that
50482 i am fully committed to biketopia to show new yorkers how excited i am about this i have a very special fireworks spectacular planned we will have a public reading of while everyone stands in the middle of their livable streets the fireworks will be timed to go off at the exact moment that our beautiful beloved bikeable walkable city crumbles on its very foundations

50490 often it is the work and sacrifice one experiences in obtaining money for a worthwhile purpose that produces the most satisfaction
50491 their family was very poor having emigrated from denmark with little more than the clothes on their backs she wanted so much to have a pair of shoes she could wear on special occasions to accomplish this worthy desire took a full summers work of picking berries and tending children since money was very scarce and labor was cheap but the joy grandmother felt as she obtained those shoes is indescribable for not only was she able to wear them but her mother did also in fact they had it arranged so grandmother would wear the shoes to sunday school in the morning and then her mother would wear them to sacrament meeting in the evening
50492 happiness does not always require success prosperity or attainment it is often the joy of hopeful struggle consecration of purpose and energy to some good end real happiness ever has its root in unselfishness its blossom in love of some kind

50583 cabe recordar que dicha acusaci n corresponde a la formulada por el ex director de conadi jaime andrade qui n habr a concurrido a participar de una reuni n en la comunidad el d a 29 de agosto del 2006 informando posteriormente por medio de una conferencia de prensa que habr a sido objeto de agresiones por parte de nuestra gente
50584 muchas familias han perdido sus zonas de pastoreos donde daban de comer a sus animales tambi n fueron afectadas plantas originarias del lugar que los comuniarios utilizaban para su uso familiar y personal
50585 manquiri se comprometi apoyar el plan de desarrollo y a las familias m s afectadas pero hasta ahora su apoyo no es el esperado y en otros caso no ha hecho nada
50586 todas las organizaciones mapuche y sociales deben sumarse a esta justa y noble causa
50587 en todo momento estamos abiertos al di logo y si lo hubi ramos hecho cortado di logo y ser violentos no se hubiera hecho presente la intendenta a las 2 de la ma ana en el mismo recinto ocupado lo que dice la conadi es una gran falsedad
50588 todas las organizaciones mapuche y sociales deben sumarse a esta justa y noble causa
50589 injustificada la actitud del gobierno que no da posibilidad de di logo
50590 yo le preguntar a qu pas antes de la violencia qu pas porqu anda en la calle desde los 11 a os porqu ella se ha convertido en una activista desde los 11 a os es eso lo que esperamos de un ni o de 11 a os que ande reclamando como dec an ellos hoy por las ballenas ma ana por la ley general pasado ma ana por la causa mapuche por supuesto que hay responsabilidad de los padres los padres somos responsables del comportamiento de nuestros hijos
50591 taking the pill every day should be no different than taking them for only 3 weeks with one week off
50592 no more periods the risks of menstrual suppression and other cutting edge issues about hormones and womens health
50593 some bankers have increased plr and deposit rates which will hurt the automobile and realty stocks for time being
50594 indian markets drew strength from positive sentiments in us markets for past two days in a row as a result nifty held its ground in spite of f amp o expiry
50595 indian markets seemed to have completely absorbed negative impact of repo and crr hike by rbi two days ago it appears that inflation data to be announced today will also be taken in its stride
50596 durante los dos encuentros que tuvimos con el se or ega a le presentamos una serie de temas m s que abordamos entre los que destacamos ayuda de emergencia bono de sequ a bono de invierno educaci n programa or genes violaci n de los derechos humanos implementaci n de las recomendaciones del relator especial de mas naciones unidas entre otros los cuales por la inoperancia de los funcionarios p blicos involucrados en ambas reuniones ni siquiera se alcanzaron a abordar lo que demuestra que no hay posibilidad de avanzar de manera seria
50597 hacemos un llamado a las comunidades mapuche a que se movilicen por la defensa y restituci n de nuestras tierras usurpadas para garantizar en futuro de nuestras comunidades y sus generaciones futuras adem s a que no se dejen enga ar por los representantes del estado chileno que hoy s lo hacen esfuerzos para usurparnos nuestro ltimos recursos
50598 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
50599 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
50600 nos preocupa la suerte y el estado de elena debido a que tanto el gobierno como varios medios de comunicaci n han condenado a priori a la realizadora es importante resguardar que los cargos que se le imputan deben ser investigados y juzgados con seriedad y sin juicios previos
50601 en nombre del arte la libertad de expresi n y creaci n art stica solicito mi libertad
50602 estoy asombrada de c mo pasan las cosas en la araucania durante los tres ltimos a os he recopilado antecedentes para realizar este relato soy testigo de la persecuci n de un pueblo ahora vivo aqu entre la gente de la tierra este documental tiene para m un valor de humanidad cuando digo esto me refiero a la vida de un pueblo
50603 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
50604 the best way to achieve security is to prevent war when possible and to encourage peaceful change within the international system
50605 we must be prepared to deal with sudden disruptions to help prevent them from escalating or endangering international security and to find ways to bring them swiftly to a conclusion
50606 china continues to modernize and develop military capabilities primarily focused on a taiwan strait conflict but which could have application in other contingencies the department will respond to chinas expanding military power and to the uncertainties over how it might be used through shaping and hedging this approach tailors investment of substantial but not infinite resources in ways that favor key enduring u s strategic advantages at the same time we will continue to improve and refine our capabilities to respond to china if necessary
50607 we must tailor deterrence to fit particular actors situations and forms of warfare the same developments that add to the complexity of the challenge also offer us a greater variety of capabilities and methods to deter or dissuade adversaries
50608 for this reason deterrence must remain grounded in demonstrated military capabilities that can respond to a broad array of challenges to international security missile
50609 although improving the u s armed forces proficiency in irregular warfare is the defense departments top priority the united states does not have the luxury of preparing exclusively for such challenges
50610 rogue states will remain a threat to u s regional interests iran and north korea continue to exert coercive pressure in their respective regions where each seek to challenge or reduce u s influence responding to and as necessary defeating these and potentially other rogue states will remain a major challenge we must maintain the capabilities required to defeat state adversaries including those armed with nuclear weapons
50611 we combine non proliferation efforts to deny these weapons and their components to our adversaries active efforts to defend against and defeat wmd and missile threats before they are unleashed and improved protection to mitigate the consequences of wmd use
50612 we should not limit ourselves to the relationships of the past we must broaden our ideas to include partnerships for new situations or circumstances calling on moderate voices in troubled regions and unexpected partners in some cases we may develop arrangements limited to specific objectives or goals or even of limited duration
50613 for more than sixty years the united states has secured the global commons for the benefit of all global prosperity is contingent on the free flow of ideas goods and services
50614 the united states will continue to foster access to and flow of energy resources vital to the world economy
50615 we as a nation must strengthen not only our military capabilities but also reinvigorate other important elements of national power and develop the capability to integrate tailor and apply these tools as needed we must tap the full strength of america and its people
50616 our forces have stepped up to the task of long term reconstruction development and governance the u s armed forces will need to institutionalize and retain these capabilities but this is no replacement for civilian involvement and expertise
50617 greater civilian participation is necessary both to make military operations successful and to relieve stress on the men and women of the armed forces
50618 we also need capabilities to meet the challenges of the 21st century strategic communications within the department and across government is a good example although the united states invented modern public relations we are unable to communicate to the world effectively who we are and what we stand for as a society and culture about freedom and democracy and about our goals and aspirations
50619 the department will continue to emphasize the areas identified in the 2006 qdr specifically improvements in capabilities for defeating terrorist networks defending the homeland in depth shaping the choices of countries at strategic crossroads and preventing adversaries acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction although these capabilities are not sufficient to address all the missions of the department they require particular attention
50620 u s predominance in traditional warfare is not unchallenged but is sustainable for the medium term given current trends the 2006 qdr focused on non traditional or irregular challenges we will continue to focus our investments on building capabilities to address these other challenges while examining areas where we can assume greater risk
50621 the department will invest in hedging against the loss or disruption of our traditional advantages not only through developing mitigation strategies but also by developing alternative or parallel means to the same end this diversification parallelism is distinct from acquiring overmatch capabilities whereby we have much more than an adversary of a similar capability it will involve pursuing multiple routes to similar effects while ensuring that such capabilities are applicable across multiple mission areas
50622 we are very very honored and delighted that the jets have been involved with us for many many years
50623 we are sorry to see them leave the area but we know they arent going to leave our spirits and our support
50624 nick wanted to know what he could do to be of help and got others involved
50625 vinny testaverde has been involved chad pennington and his wife have been involved and many other players as well
50626 we do our share of soles program with the foundation providing backpacks and brand new shoes for the homeless children that they work with so they can go to school on the first day with brand new shoes and a brand new backpack
50627 we actually have a little clothing store where people can take clothing for free and debbie helps set that up and interacts with the guests
50628 she also will help in the kitchen as well when were short handed with volunteers to serve the food she has been absolutely phenomenal
50629 the way she started is she usually went twice a week then shes been involved in the big fundraising ball they have ever year and shes really enjoyed the fundraising experience they do a great job feeding the people who are obviously in need and providing clothing
50630 we have 25 apartments for families who are turning their lives around we have three emergency shelters for people who are homeless at the moment and we have about 100 people in the three emergency shelters two for families and one for single men
50631 i saw early on as a lot of people recognize that you can emotionally burn out from just being exposed to the trauma of other peoples lives
50632 but fortunately because of the dignity and respect that is shown to everybody we see hope every single day
50633 i think a lot of times people get caught up with their own lives and forget a lot of people go without the basic necessities
50634 anytime you can help provide whatever that is within your own budget for someone else who lives without the basic necessities i think its extremely important as human beings we all have an obligation to help one another
50635 the navajo nation has been waiting for this a long time its a matter of economic opportunity and tribal sovereignty for the navajos
50636 wow this hunger thing is horrible let me see if i can draw some attention to them
50637 shell is making substantial targeted investments to grow the company for shareholders and help ensure that energy markets remain well supplied
50638 it wasnt a matter of leveling outrage but of voicing israels strong concerns
50639 with all the evidence that is now before them i dont see any reason why the authorities should continue with these investigations of alleged sodomy
50640 in any other system where there is justice and fairness the powers would have by now shut down the investigations and cleared my name
50641 who would have guessed that when you remove garfield from the garfield comic strips the garfield minus garfield gets its own book and no lawsuits either www heraldnet com
50642 can replace the kde 3 shell for most casual users
50643 moments that end up burning up your night time hours and possibly creating a financial problem as well most places ive worked have at least one box that is fairly lax
50644 its time for the company to move beyond focusing on the merger and be able to develop its own identity and personality beyond that of the former alcatel and the former lucent
50645 i will continue to run the company just as i had been since the merger as i work with the board in identifying a new ceo for the company and ensure a smooth transition
50646 this year over year decrease was primarily due to a decline in cdma resulting from a significant reduction in capital expenditures by one of our big north american customers
50647 while cdma is facing challenges we dont believe weve lost footprint in north america and we will continue to invest in the technology
50648 were now seeing some concern that the slowing u s economy is starting to spread to europe
50649 the dollar euro exchange rate continues to be a factor that negatively impact our top line as a result of the fact that approximately half of our revenues are in u s dollars or dollar linked currencies
50650 weve pleased with the progress weve made operationally in q2
50651 our results came in overall in line with our expectations though underneath we clearly had some puts and takes
50652 e government has stopped the bleeding for now in terms of citizen satisfaction
50653 but it remains to be seen if this is a blip or the beginning of a positive trend
50654 whereas private sector web sites are accountable to shareholders e government is accountable to the citizens who use the web sites and to all taxpayers
50655 government has a responsibility to get the most bang for the taxpayer buck
50656 virtual machines are easy to deploy and propagate like rabbits and that causes complexity of management from the data perspective
50657 before people were virtualizing print and other servers and testing and development where losing data wasnt that important or consolidating legacy applications into smaller newer servers
50658 now theyre moving into e mail servers and transaction oriented applications where problems get magnified
50659 may well have to rethink their data backup and recovery infrastructure
50660 web 2 0 sites are completely dynamic sites that change on a day to day basis allowing user uploadable content and tool uploads from third party sites
50661 i can put up the latest interesting movie in adobe flash on my social page with malware embedded in it and if you access the movie but dont have the latest software patches ill be able to exploit you
50662 there probably should be regulations about the type of personal data that individuals could or should upload to sites like that
50663 presumably employees who work from home or at remote locations are transferring data behind the firewall from external sources
50664 exactly how much scanning of data goes on and what type of security policies are created to deal with that data are issues companies need to keep an eye on
50665 the exchange of information is much freer and easier on social networking sites but it doesnt take a large hole to let a lot of bad code into any environment
50666 often some of the web applications come from components that shouldnt be trusted whose origins cant be tracked
50667 the content on these sites should be scanned in real time
50668 enterprises have to remember that even when components come from places you think you have complete control over in most cases you dont have that control
50669 malicious groups get paid for installing malware on computers and they get paid for every victim computer they seize
50670 you are going to see that this is a feature people are going to want everywhere
50671 a ra z de una discusi n en los foros de ubuntu acab traduciendo una lista de preguntas de una entrevista de trabajo apta para linuxeros
50672 effectively the department is saying that a primary care trust should be able to say to a dentist your contract will come to an end tomorrow just because we feel like it
50673 every right minded person can see that this is totally unreasonable and would destroy the viability of family dental practices
50674 a success for the department of health would be bad for dentists bad for patients and disastrous for the health of the nation
50675 this obviously happened a while ago this blood is very thick i mean this could have possibly happened last night and maybe no one wouldve even seen it
50676 running the numbers looks at contemporary american culture through the austere lens of statistics
50677 we think that the timing of a new product introduction will depend upon the sales profile for the ds and believe that lower than expected ds hardware sales could trigger an earlier launch
50678 use of a p2p file sharing application would constitute a material breach of contract for which the users service could be terminated
50679 that the commission issue an interpretive release to provide additional guidance and greater certainty on how companies can use their web sites to provide information to investors in

50744 ideal weight according to the height and body type charts suffice it to say it would keep some diet pill manufacturer in business for a while
50745 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
50746 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
50747 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
50748 of itself mg production at longbridge is not going to be sizeable
50749 we are not talking about many cars we are talking about a screwdriver operation with parts coming in from china
50750 but symbolically it is hugely important it indicates a commitment to the site and we are likely to see sizeable production in two years time of a medium size car and research and development coming back so great news
50751 this is part of a long term commitment inside of 18 months we hope to have a brand new mg model designed in the uk and built at longbridge
50752 we should have further announcements about research and development and network dealerships as the uk part of the business expands
50753 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
50754 god new york would rather burn their city down than put a disabled model on the catwalk i reckon
50755 its too early to say whether it has achieved what it set out to do
50756 it was probably seen as more of a reality programme than i would have hoped but its better than the subject not being broached at all
50757 i wanted somebody who was completely obviously disabled and capable of taking the industry by the scruff of the neck
50758 i hope kelly knox does that ive got an inkling she cant i hope she proves me wrong
50759 its good that the programme happened that somebody has been brave enough to do it enough people seem to be talking about it
50760 im not into modelling and i thought the show could be awful like another reality tv show but then i realised it was trying to do something to change peoples perceptions
50761 its been a tiny little step but hopefully one that may make an impact
50762 i think they made the right decision she is a lot more photogenic than i am and at the end of the day they are looking for a model
50763 i thought she didnt really care about it all that much because of things she told me but i think she may have changed her opinions
50764 i think thats unfair of course i care i wouldnt have done the programme in the first place if i didnt
50765 because i was born this way having one arm is normal to me its only since this show that i have been labelled disabled and thats been quite weird for me
50766 but even if i can make even a small difference that will be incredible im willing to put myself out there and be that role model
50767 we are supportive of anything that challenges negative stereotypes and that will result in a more equal playing field
50768 the programme highlighted the lack of equality and lack of opportunities for any woman who doesnt conform to the very narrow stereotypes of beauty
50769 its not a situation where you would expect any world records to be broken
50770 athletes breathe in ten times as much air into their lungs as spectators
50771 the pollution will cause their lungs to decrease in diameter so they will not be able to take as much air into their lungs which will affect their performance
50772 some of the athletes will suffer severe reactions and all will see impacts on their health
50773 they are pushing their bodies to their limits so pollution will have serious consequences
50774 this executive order will make our city more accessible while helping us become the most inclusive municipal government in the nation
50775 were in the first stages of planning some agencies will have to translate documents online some with branch offices may have to hire people
50776 i think this will hurt immigrants long term assimilation into american society both socially and economically
50777 most workplaces require them to speak english this policy does them no favors
50778 its easy to get mad at the opec nations when they raise the price of oil but maybe we should get mad at ourselves
50779 opec oil is priced in american dollars in the last few years while our dollar has been going down in value relative to more stable currencies the opec nations have to up the number of dollars they get just to stay even and it is we who are responsible for reducing the value of the dollar
50780 the need to zero in on inflation and not push the panic button because of recession now the leaders in congress are making it very evident that political considerations will determine what they do not what is good for the country
50781 calling for the federal reserve board to loosen the purse strings
50782 sometimes it seems as if congress will do anything to avoid cutting spending or facing reality may i suggest that you write and tell them no more tranquilizers we want a permanent cure for what ails us and that doesnt mean printing press money
50783 if you were at the race track and the handicappers told you the odds of a certain horse were 100 to 1 youd figure his chances of winning were pretty slim
50784 have put the odds on a fatal accident occurring in a nuclear power plant at 300 million to 1 put another way its about as likely as you being run over by a horse in your bathtub
50785 how much do you miss dinosaurs would your life be richer if those giant pre historic flying lizards occasionally settled on your front lawn
50786 we have contributed to the disappearance of some species by destroying habitat or hunting them down for food fun and feathers but shouldnt we now and then remember natures part in the elimination of some species and separate the serious from the silly in our own policy
50787 ronald reagan was prescient about many issues focused on the big picture and his values suffused everything he wrote
50788 as a communicator he remains the gold standard much of what he discussed is as timely today as it was then
50789 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself
50790 you have a choice be a fighting liberal or sit quietly i know what i am what are you
50791 sorry cant do tonight because my boss has me staying late well get together next weekend
50792 personality disorders are typically some of the most challenging mental disorders to treat since they are by definition an integral part of what defines an individual and their self perceptions treatment most often focuses on increasing coping skills and interpersonal relationship skills through psychotherapy
50793 matt have you seen this cat its just like tiger
50794 the sun is a dangerously bright object and must never be viewed directly unless you have special eclipse glasses welders goggles or a professional solar filter
50795 sunglasses are not safe and never use home made filters such as cds photographic negatives or coloured film they are dangerous and can let through invisible radiation that can blind you
50796 because compassion is too strong he treats samsara as his place of practise
50797 if a person can only be guided or saved by a government official avalokitesvara bodhisattva shall manifest as a government official to explain the dharma to him if a person can only be guided or saved by a king of ghosts avalokitesvara bodhisattva shall manifest as a king of ghosts to explain the dharma to him if a person can only be guided or saved by embracing another religion avalokitesvara bodhisattva shall manifest as a person of that same religion to explain the dharma to him
50798 i am indeed fortunate to meet a person like you i have spoken to my teacher about you and he says that you are a good man you are devoted and in future many good things will happen to you
50799 my teacher commented that you are no good and you are a believer of an unorthodox religion
50800 since my husband worships the bodhisattva as a taoist perhaps i should do likewise

50806 the availability of the internet has allowed kids to be very engaged in the political process and also be very educated
50807 i myself am a religious reader of political web sites as are a lot of my friends
50808 my prayer is that people will be reminded that we serve and worship a holy god who is more than we can ever fathom sometimes i feel that we often tip our hat to god and go about our week without ever encountering him and recognizing him for the holy one that he is
50809 for me it isnt about going out and pounding a bible over a persons head but instead striving to reflect god in everything i do worship is more about a lifestyle than any song written or any service on a sunday morning

50815 theres outrage among anglos and latinos over what happened and i think thats representative of the attitude here
50816 lets call it what it was it was a street fight a chance encounter with a tragic outcome
50817 they called each other names the victim was calling them obscenities vulgar names and they said things back to him that would hurt him
50818 it just means it was a foul mouthed argument not ethnic intimidation
50819 he worked hard so his kids would have more than he had growing up
50820 he talked a lot about how we take so much for granted here
50821 i just dont understand how you can beat someone so badly when you dont even know them
50822 people here are just ignorant they think life begins and ends in shenandoah
50823 its very stressing because you just dont expect it if you had a child thats constantly in trouble youd say hey well this is coming any day
50824 colin was a great kid and fell into a bad situation he never really gave me any trouble
50825 i feel sorry for the families and anyone who cares about mr ramirez
50826 you would be proud to have any of these kids in your classroom and any of them as your children

50834 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
50835 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
50836 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal
50837 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
50838 the united states abstained from the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president bashir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
50839 the uk did not believe it was right to consider such an issue as part of unamids mandate
50840 we will not stand in the way of a security council discussion although that discussion will raise profound questions about the balance of peace and justice
50841 no one will be immune from its catastrophic consequences the whole of sudan and the entire region

50847 i just think one of the trickiest things is learning how to read yes acting is all about being imaginative and creative but you have to start looking at the writers intentions also
50848 you really start to glean how hes telling the story what kind of character you are what might happen in the future and whether there are sort of some universal truths there
50849 first of all just the real basics of classical acting this is important because the kids have an interest in careers in acting the second thing is a sense of ensemble a sense of their relationship to other people who are all working really hard
50850 i learned how to breathe through my chest which has really helped me to project my voice for my character
50851 so hopefully from watching this play theyll see that love is actually a hard thing hopefully people will know to be more careful when they choose their partners and that they have to be honest about whom they love
50852 however i can say that ice agents and officers conduct targeted enforcement operations and arrest those in violation of both immigration and customs laws
50853 theyre not criminals theyre human beings and they just want to take care of their families at home
50854 this would permit those who want to self deport to do so in an organized manner
50855 the idea that millions of people are going to knock on the governments door and ask to be deported is pure fantasy

50918 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
50919 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
50920 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
50921 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted

50939 in order to judge whether or not an exchange is free one must know whether or not the will is moved toward a good end this requires some kind of substantive not merely formal acount of the true end or telos of the human person where there are no objectively desirable ends and the individual is told to choose his or her ends then choice itself becomes the only thing that is inherently good and yet augustine says desire for objects that are cut free from their source and their end in god is ultimately the desire for nothing a person buys something anything trying to fill the hole that is the empty shrine and once the shopper purchases the thing it turns into a nothing and she has to head back to the mall to continue the search with no objective ends to guide the search her search is literally endless

50954 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
50955 you notice that i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes gonna do and the reason is because those folks know they dont have any good answers they know theyve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things they know that youre not real happy with them
50956 and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
50957 but think about it whats the bigger risk us deciding that were going to come together to bring about real change in america or continuing to do same things with the same folks in the same ways that we know have not worked i mean are we really going to do the same stuff that weve been doing over the last eight years thats a risk we cannot afford the stakes are too high
50958 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me
50959 but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
50960 and you know the latest one theyve got me in an ad with paris hilton
50961 you know never met the woman but but you know what theyre gonna try to argue is that somehow im too risky
50962 while obama is out pulling the race card on mccain and doing everything else he can people are beginning to wake up and see through his lies and shallow self serving ego
50963 for some presidential candidate barack obama looks like the savior of american politics but a visit to a campaign speech provides a sobering wake up call the senator from illinois does not live up to the myth his campaigners are trying to create
50964 is surrounded by silence as he departs the applause doesnt even carry as far as backstage his shoes make a clicking sound on the wooden floor the crowd was not merciless in its reaction just honest the senator from illinois is recognizably not the product which he is being sold as at the beginning he was described as a rising african american star that was back when people still were still being modest then the political marketing people reached up onto the top shelf and started referring to him as the new kennedy the new martin luther king jr the first black president
50965 in berlin supporters of one of these organizations puma party unity my ass were distributing leaflets calling for such an open party convention

50973 we were told it was completely unprovoked we dont know if they think it is mistaken identity
50974 it was really the case of the steering failing on the ship as it was going around on the bend going out of the harbour
50975 theres three ships in the port loading and two waiting to come in so we are attempting to refloat the vessel
50976 well be able to pull the vessel off this morning hopefully
50977 if that doesnt work the next high tide is around the same time tomorrow morning so well try additional measures and maybe some additional vessels

50980 by the looks of it theres two tugs trying to pull it backwards and theres two on the starboard side trying to push the nose towards the ocean
50981 i told ken it was like he was walking between the raindrops

50984 a lot of fund managers fall in love with an idea and ride it all the way down
50985 im not waiting for morgan stanley to tell me theres something wrong in china
50986 i thought jesus most of the people in the money management business dont have any idea what any of the saudi arabian oil fields are called much less where they are or what their production history is
50987 then he says let me tell you what im hearing
50988 hell get agitated because hes not going to be trading for three days
50989 i thought the guy was going to eat me he was so mad
50990 i worry hes going to drown in that thing someday
50991 and i look back at ken and hes kneeling on the seat with the steering wheel in his hand smiling ear to ear my knees are shaking and hes having the time of his life
50992 theres nothing i recall about ken that suggested the kind of success hes had as an investor he was relatively quiet in a group of individuals who were pretty dynamic
50993 ken did march to his own drumbeat but he was absolutely brilliant i never ever doubted that he was going to be a great investor
50994 ken was hoarding silver dollars on the idea that silver was going to keep appreciating which would eventually force the treasury to stop issuing new silver coins
50995 it was funny as hell hed be sitting there with piles of silver dollars on his desk but ken had it nailed
50996 he saw something the rest of us didnt thats ken thats always been ken
50997 the treasury had these uncirculated silver dollars in bags in vaults you could walk in with a thousand dollars and theyd give you a bag of 1 000 silver dollars
50998 i think my energy level back then was so high that i just made people uneasy
50999 someone told me there was a fellow with some talent at scudder but he was loud and talked back
51000 i said i dont care if he talks back just as long as he has the right answers
51001 here was a guy with a much more modest organization who kept just punching out the numbers
51002 hes very thematic and he stays with things for a very long time but once hes convinced that something is deteriorating thats it
51003 the day peter retired i thought ken was going to cry
51004 i had a good investment record so obviously if they saw me buying something they would want to look at it too
51005 the problem i had is that when you go from 50 times earnings to 100 times to 150 times how do you know when the idiots are going to stop bidding these things up thats the thing about bubbles how do you know when theyre going to end
51006 wed just got out of boston harbor and were about to put up the sails when ken announces weve got to turn back i said what do you mean we have to turn back its a beautiful day ken said look out there theres a big bank of fog rolling in well all i saw was the horizon but by the time we got back to the slip you couldnt even see from the cockpit up to the front of the boat thats how thick the fog was

51022 usaha pemerintahan bush untuk memaksakan kesepakatan ini sebelum berakhir masa berlakunya adalah kolonialisme yang memalukan untuk bisa terus mempertahankan pijakan militernya di wilayah itu sehingga dapat terus dilakukan barat ini menunjukkan kemiripan akan kesepakatan yang ditandatangani rezim kaki tangan di irak pada masa kolonial di irak tahun 1930 dengan pemerintah inggris kesepakatan ini bersama dengan pangkalan amerika yang ada sekarang di kuwait dan qatar menunjukkan bahwa hanya sedikit yang berubah sejak pangkalan militer amerika di arab saudi dibongkar barat harus menyadari bahwa mereka tidak dapat terus melakukan usaha untuk menghalang halangi dunia islam untuk memilih ketentuan politiknya terus memperlakukan wilayah itu seperti stasiun bahan bakar miliknya sendiri dan kemudian bersaing satu sama lain untuk mengkontrol bagian besar dari minyak di wilayah itu
51023 seperti ayahnya kebrutalan bashar al assad tidak mengenal batas ia telah berusaha untuk mengenyahkan segala bentuk oposisi terhadap kekuasaan tiraninya negosiasinya dengan israel melalui segala bentuk penangkapan penyiksaan dan penahanan ribuan aktifis gerakan islam termasuk anggota ht dan yang baru baru ini dengan membantai mereka di penjara
51024 tindakan keji ini telah dilaporkan di berbagai kantor berita politisi barat dan corong medianya begitu gigih menentang diktator seperti mugabe namun herannya tetap diam terhadap berita yang sungguh memprihatinkan ini

51038 i just added purgatorio to my blogroll for good reason marc heinrich is a witty christian hedonist from minnesota surprisingly who blogs entirely through the medium of pictures more importantly he also likes radiohead go check it out its not the usual fare in biblio blogging and its worth your time express enough interest and maybe hell invite you to stay at his house
51039 marc you are an instigator arent you that is one reason why purgatorio is great
51040 usually pot shot takers arent ecumenical enough for my taste or funny enough but this site is exceptionally funny and not so mean spirited
51041 there are very few christian bloggers that are consistently able to write funny posts marc heinrich is not one of them he is able to be consistently funny while writing almost nothing and that is why his blog is one of my favorites
51042 im chocking over here i will just come right out and say it what i visited and that blob site is garbage my soul within me is burning are you guys serious cmon what is this blog im disgusted
51043 my favorite place for funny or weird photos that say more about people than words can
51044 one of the truly unique efforts in the christian blogosphere
51045 be perjoritive if you like i beleive you will see that my readers will discern which of us is a kook im not the fundie here your comments prove my point big time
51046 i really should rule 40 this blog but these kinds of posts cant be found elsewhere
51047 id like to point out that marc is somewhat delusional from searching the internet for images that he thinks are related its kinda like the episode of voyager where seven links her alcove into the ships sensor logs and becomes hyper paranoid about the intentions of the crew and ultimately pits janeway against chakotay even though both conspiracy theories cannot be true
51048 the days go so slow and the years go so fast
51049 karen you are such a failure why cant you say no why do you always cave why cant you be strong and not give in you have a closet full of clothes that dont fit evidence that you are once again a failure
51050 im great thanks even though my rear is looking like the state of texas
51051 just write from your heart write for you and the rest will follow

51061 we are disappointed and frustrated with the broadcast by sbs beijing olympics committee spokesman sun weide said on thursday
51062 the purpose of the broadcast was aimed at heightening enthusiasm toward the beijing olympics by showing south korean viewers the magnificence of the opening ceremony there was no other intention
51063 we will provide sufficient access to the internet for reporters
51064 ensure that the beijing 2008 olympic games take place in an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness

51070 its dr strangelove but its the kind of dr strangelove you could see governments really using
51071 i think were faced with such an enormous problem that we need to do all the research we can to see if there are any geo engineering proposals which work through to the marketplace
51072 we wont have anything that we can bring into place in 2030 say when suddenly the world is at a crisis point
51073 they could buy the aircraft and buy the rockets and just start doing some geo engineering off their own island
51074 we need to make sure that there is control and validation over any of these procedures but at the same time lets not take attention away from the major issue of removing our dependence on fossil fuels
51075 investments in geo engineering research are almost certainly the biggest bang for the buck that one could get in terms of addressing catastrophic climate change a much much bigger return than for example trying to control carbon emissions at the moment
51076 in fact diverting money into controlling carbon emissions and away from geo engineering is probably morally irresponsible
51077 geo engineering is not something were going to want to use as a first choice i think the chances are likely that it will eventually be used for better or worse in circumstances in which the risks of not using it seem to be higher than the risks of using it
51078 i was thinking maybe id give him one tonight but naw fuck him
51079 education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity
51080 we had teams come back to us with things we just could never get anything that was a good baseball trade for the minnesota twins we didnt get anything that could make us better
51081 were a team thats built a lot on chemistry and how we play together we play as a unit
51082 were a team that plays for each other and plays for minnesota and thats all we worry about we try not to be individuals and if you bring guys in sometimes it can disrupt that what weve got is working pretty good hopefully it works the rest of the way
51083 now you have to sit nick swisher or konerko or jim thome might not get as many at bats there are a lot of guys that have a lot of experience over there as much as you can be happy for the team guys usually arent happy when theyre not playing
51084 we really like this group of young pitchers we said that last january and we still like this group of players
51085 i think for this year we made the right decisions and certainly for next year
51086 soon as i saw the trade i thought what well more work for me
51087 i always want to pitch doesnt matter who is in front of you ill just have to get to work and figure him out
51088 education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity
51089 ive always been a mickey mantle fan and a greg norman fan greg is a legend so dynamic i grew up watching him
51090 if there wasnt a regular place for him to play you would never have a chance to see norman
51091 i connect with them because theyre the same age as i am
51092 these guys are still hitting the ball as far as these young kids and i say that shows theres still a chance for us guys to get out and hit the ball
51093 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
51094 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
51095 the us and the uk must at last come clean about the scope of extraordinary rendition and secret detention a violation of american and british law human rights standards and the rules and regulations of nato both congress and parliament must set the record straight about what happened at diego garcia phr knows from our twenty one year history of documenting torture around the world that secret detention opens the floodgates to torture and other gross human rights abuses
51096 the bush administrations detainee treatment and interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation as human rights leader seven years of secrets whispered in secret rooms must give way to on the record testimony and open hearings
51097 the cia and the department of defense categorically deny having interrogated any terrorist suspects or terrorism related detainee on diego garcia in any cases since september 11 2001 with the exceptions of the two cases in 2002 in which detainees transited dg that previously have been disclosed to the uk government there have been no other instances in which terrorist suspects or terrorism related detainees transited or were held there
51098 the u s government is holding prisoners in a secret system of offshore prisons beyond the reach of adequate supervision accountability or law
51099 i love to ride my bike theres always something new some new story to tell my wife when i get home like being chased home by a thunderstorm through the flint hills where im literally the tallest object within several miles in any direction a perfect lighting rod keeping pace exactly with the leading edge of hail and wind or seeing the shadows of a dozen vultures circling overhead in the 100 degree heat when they realize that ive just sucked down the last drop of water in my stash and still have 10 miles yet to go to the nearest drink or the screaming hawk that swoops down over my head as i race toward his catch of road kill opossum or coon or rabbit they always come at me from behind and really scare the shit out of me honestly mr hawk i have no interest in your lunch then theres the pheasant startled by my rapid descent down a hill and decides to escape certain doom by flying out of the ditch through my front wheel then there are larger creatures like the escaped horse trotting down the middle of the road which i have learned from experience to give a wide berth while passing lest they freak out and kick you in the head i actually caught an escaped horse in downtown topeka once i enticed it to munch on some tall grass id pulled up from the sidewalk grabbed its mane and walked it a block and a half to the animal control office at the police station the look on their faces when they opened the door look what i caught and then most recently a feral pig that chased me about 100 yards up a hill this past saturday it occurred to me after my adrenaline came down from overdrive that id just imagined it a black pig snorting and squealing just like youd expect an angry pig to snort and squeal leaping from the underbrush on the side of the road and giving a very good chase up the road a dog miniature horse what the hell was that but the existence of said pig is well known in that part of the county and it was confirmed by a co worker whod just moved out there and also was chased by the pig on her horse i honestly didnt realize that pigs can run faster than dogs now i do yes what brave new world that has such creatures in it a bicycle in the countryside freaking out the local residents i love to ride my bike
51100 a fellow biker whos much faster and stronger than me just reminded me that its thought that the newly discovered mountain lions in these parts take care of most of the feral pigs i feel so much better now tp

51128 i feel a lot better knowing that under oath nelson said that in between the mavs finals games he was meeting with their gm and helping thewarriors work on their draft plans that he and his lawyers had started discussions more than a month before he took the job not days as he said publicly
51129 unfortunately according to the arbitrator because i held back about 25 000 in payments as i tried to understand the situation i breached our consulting agreement so i am obligated to pay him the deferred money he was to be paid
51130 basically i pay him the exact same amount i would have had this not happened
51131 this stuff is going to get worse unless the economy turns around

51153 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
51154 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
51155 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
51156 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
51157 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
51158 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater

51163 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
51164 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
51165 i asked secretary of state condi rice to review it and the database will be restored where it was seven days ago
51166 rather than approaching it politically the matter of dokdo is something to be solved long term among private level academics and publishers along with the government through incessant checks and lobbying
51167 the restoration is a result of recovered alliance and trust between korea and the united states such a speedy measure reflects us president george w bushs full understanding of the koreans sentiment and the deep trust and friendship between the two leaders
51168 our diplomatic goal is restoring the proper noun of dokdo so it could go back to the situation of 1977
51169 president bush told ambassador lee tae sik that he knew well of the issue and instructed secretary rice to look into the matter
51170 its better than being the guy that says nothing and gets completely overpowered
51171 but im not going to ring her up to go for a coffee or to go to a party i couldnt think of anything worse

51181 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
51182 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
51183 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
51184 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
51185 first of all that was one of three instances yesterday that barack obama said the same thing in three different locations in missouri secondarily his campaign actively has been feeding to journalists all night last night and all day today the notion that somehow something we have done in our campaign of which i could not identify for you today was somehow had racial overtones third liberal blogs all around the country were actively pursuing this this morning which i can only assume didnt come out of the blue and so i just wanted to make it clear and to be honest i dont know how else you explain the quote that you just played other than to believe that somehow barack obama was calling something wed done racist or something we had done with racial overtones otherwise i dont know what else he was talking about
51186 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
51187 the united states abstained from the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president bashir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
51188 the uk did not believe it was right to consider such an issue as part of security council discussion although that discussion will raise profound questions about the balance of peace and justice
51189 no one will be immune from its catastrophic consequences the whole of
51190 its not easy coming from slower conditions to fast ones
51191 but i have played ivo on all surfaces and he actually gets a greater play on the slower ones
51192 but what are you going to do today if he serves like that maybe if i got the first set i would be sitting here and it would be different but thats not the case
51193 i took out two canadians maybe the people will start to hate me now
51194 in those two matches the crowd was obviously against me
51195 playing a canadian in front of a home crowd its not too easy to be in this kind of atmosphere im pleased how i handled the whole situation
51196 i just play to win a grand slam champion shes really a great player it was a really tough match
51197 but it was a fun match i enjoyed myself it was a good fight
51198 maybe we have to turn off the life support tomorrow and take him home
51199 the government is very satisfied with the swift action of the greek police in pursuing the perpetrators of this crime and appreciates the high level involvement of very senior police officials in the investigation
51200 we are so ashamed for what happened this is not what we are
51201 they found water on mars big f king deal what we needed for them to find is oil
51202 why the hell do you think weve been spending all that money on the phoenix mars lander to get some martian ice no way jose we needed to start way way off shore oil drilling there immediately now whatya got zip nada nothin
51203 you cannot imagine my disappointment i just dont know what to say
51204 over and over again boynton also said that water was positively identified after the landers robotic arm delivered a soil sample on wednesday to an instrument that identifies vapors produced by heating
51205 that damn mars machine can use its robotic arm to pleasure itself up there in space for all i care
51206 if im in the white house i will have one rule for nasa no texas tee no government moolah capice
51207 with corporate australia drastically cutting back its support for charity and community groups this year clubs are increasingly the glue that is holding many groups together
51208 similarly massive cuts in sporting grants are having a significant impact on junior and senior teams

51214 although black americans have typically been the klans primary target it also has attacked jews immigrants homosexuals and until recently catholics over the years since it was formed in december 1865 the klan has typically seen itself as a christian organization although in modern times klan groups are motivated by a variety of theological and political ideologies
51215 with all the scams and stuff it does make you wonder i mean with computer frauds and everything else i know i got it with my bank accounts and stuff its scary with all the stuff thats going through right now

51221 ad supported music has some bright spots and some low points im not sure where trueanthem ranks but i like its business model the startup raised 2 million and added adidas as a sponsor unlike most free ad supported music songs from trueanthem are available as mp3 files the ones i downloaded were 128kbps and begin with brief audio advertisements there is also an ad at the bottom of each widget from which songs are streamed and downloaded the press release says ad free tracks can be purchased for 0 99 apiece but i have not found a widget with this option
51222 there is no greater music for the cello as a solo instrument than the bach suites you know its a cliche but they really are the cellists bible when i recorded them i would play each suite through about 4 times and each time it would say new things to me thats the thing about music that great is that it has something new to say every time you listen to it
51223 dvorak was a farmer his heart was in the earth in the land and the simple things of life also the simple things in music like the folk tunes and so if one doesnt understand that one sometimes loses sight of what is the true root you know thats the beauty and simplicity of his music
51224 violinists are pretty neurotic and i mean of course singers everybody knows singers but horn players theyre all just beer drinking dirty jokes oboe players are more viewed as because theyre using so much oxygen going into their instrument through this tiny slit that they tend to be mousey laugh so big laugh im really im in deep trouble with this
51225 i think over the years i have discovered more the profound and spiritual element in bachs music i have to say i start every single day of my life playing bach its just for me its the best way to wake up to get rid of the cobwebs in the brain to clarify things its just a great way to start the day
51226 one understands intimately certain things that are so closely linked to french culture for instance the visual sense the sense of smell the sense of touch the sense of taste are highly developed and so its almost sometimes you smell the sound before you hear it you know that kind of thing comes naturally it doesnt have to be explained
51227 theyre all dance music i dont think its ever been a secret because of the titles of the movements were all dance titles thats very important for me when playing bach is to remember what dances they are where the metric stresses are and to keep them rhythmic enough that people could dance to them its like a metric discipline in a poem the discipline behind each movement is a dance
51228 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
51229 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
51230 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
51231 but recent officer involved shooting incidents have caused community leaders to raise questions about police conduct
51232 the city of inglewood has decided to engage the services of the oir to investigate the circumstances surrounding incidents since may of 2007
51233 the oir will present an independent report on its findings to the city attorney council and chief of police
51234 we will look at all of the facts and should the facts prove that we need to do something differently that we need to approach the situation differently you have my absolute word that we will do exactly that
51235 we regret to inform you that your flight has been cancelled due to the flight being understaffed now if youd kindly blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
51236 we are trying to make this more convenient for toronto residents you can go home and call to book in the comfort of your own home
51237 um how exactly is any of this convenient i need to get to new york um about right this very second if i get out of this line and go home i risk the chance that i wont get on a flight tomorrow or ill have to wait until tomorrow evening no theres nothing convenient about any of this this is your fault being understaffed is not an excuse you want to tell me that the plane has mechanical problems sure ill buy it weather issues okay fine sucks but ill deal with it but being understaffed thats the shittiest excuse ive ever heard and its something you should have known before each and every one of these people checked in put their bags on the plane went through customs and sat at the gate now im not leaving here until you book me on another flight
51238 okay you are booked on the 8 50 flight tomorrow morning
51239 it has been fun going down memory lane and realizing how many things my hands created when i was younger
51240 samantha has been incredibly therapeutic for me and really such a calming force she hangs out on stage even when im playing concertos for the rehearsal with the orchestra she sits in her bag half the time upside down just taking a nap while im rehearsing with the orchestra and nothing fazes her i always joke shes like my therapist she keeps me so calm and happy and shes a remarkable little creature
51241 all of the movements in english suites and in the partitas are essentially dance movements my fast tempi in the faster movements as anyone would hear on my recording they tend to be pretty feisty and pretty fast which i like as long as they dont feel frenetic or breathless they should have some flexibility but really they just need to dance
51242 the job of a conductor is to listen to the orchestra and then convey what ideas one has but the physical job of a conductor i would say is 99 percent listening and one percent actually moving your arms
51243 but he has never been in a jam like this
51244 they were outraged and they were hurt to this day this family continues to suffer
51245 the officers put themselves in harms way they were shot at and shot and deserved to be recognized
51246 it is a very unfortunate set of circumstances it is one of ours
51247 he refused and that is when the officer involved shooting occurred
51248 exhibiting a firearm in the presence of a police officer in a threatening manner
51249 he is just one of the most easygoing people i know
51250 this is what i love to do and i dont regret anything im looking forward going back out there
51251 i dream of an art so transparent that you can look through and see the world
51252 your whole age sits between what you hear and what you write
51253 the rangers are a great hitting team but going into the game i just tried to keep them guessing
51254 he kept the guys off balance and did a great job
51255 infant education institution as an educator the social psychologist feels that he has much to offer to a world beset by ills
51256 leroy im at a critical point in my business venture if i can win the bid for the states advertising dollars ill be set winning the bid will bring 600 000 to 700 000 of revenues into the firm on top of that i estimate that the publicity will bring another 200 000 to 300 000 of new business
51257 i understand my boss is anxious to win that business as well it would mean a huge increase in profits for my firm its a competitive business though as new as you are i doubt that youll have much chance of winning
51258 you may be wrong youre forgetting two very important considerations first i have the backing of all the resources and talent of a regional firm second i have some political connections last year i was hired to run the publicity side of the governors campaign he was impressed with my work and would like me to have this business i am confident that the proposals i submit will be very competitive my only concern is to submit a bid that beats your firm if i come in with a lower bid and good proposals the governor can see to it that i get the work
51259 sounds promising if you do win however there will be a lot of upset people after all they are going to claim that the business should have been given to local advertisers not to some out of state firm given the size of your office youll have to get support from atlanta you could take a lot of heat
51260 true but i am the owner of the branch office that fact alone should blunt most of the criticism who can argue that im not local listen with your help i think i can win this bid furthermore if i do win it you can reap some direct benefits with that kind of business i can afford to hire an accountant and ill make it worthwhile for you to transfer jobs i can offer you an up front bonus of 15 000 on top of that ill increase your salary by 20 percent that should solve most of your financial difficulties after all we have been friends since day one and what are friends for
51261 jean my wife would be ecstatic if i were able to improve our financial position as quickly as this opportunity affords i certainly hope that you win the bid what kind of help can i provide
51262 simple to win all i have to do is beat the bid of your firm before i submit my bid i would like you to review it with the financial skills that you have it should be easy for you to spot any excessive costs that i may have included or perhaps i included the wrong kind of costs by cutting excessive costs and eliminating costs that may not be directly related to the project my bid should be competitive enough to meet or beat your firms bid
51263 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
51264 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
51265 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
51266 it just feels so much safer than i ever thought it would
51267 we dont really go out anymore looking to go and fight the enemy things are stabilized so now were working more on helping the economy and getting people on their feet
51268 the fires of kirkuk will eat all iraqs cities and even the americans
51269 my soldiers ask me that every day i heard a rumor theyre reducing our deployment is it true
51270 when we used to walk the streets in april they were empty and we would be destroying buildings used by enemy positions
51271 now we walk the same streets that were covered in sewage and rubble and utter destruction and they are vibrant and full of people
51272 as the situation improves it feels more like the race is almost finished
51273 compared to youre in the middle of the race and you have a long way to go
51274 i knew it was safer but i refused to believe it i still had the same image of trash filled streets and decaying buildings when we drove through the city that first night i was in shock
51275 we are still in a country where there are people who wish us harm so i cant say i feel completely safe
51276 my customers say we think twice now whether to come
51277 we know the smugglers are not going to pause while we sort out all the varying viewpoints
51278 we have a right as a country to determine who gets admitted and who doesnt
51279 we have to have the tools in place to let the border patrol do the job
51280 its simply not plausible to say you favor border enforcement and then oppose all of the actual steps needed to have the border enforced
51281 i was walking in the woods following the signal with my receiver trying to find the turtle and i walked into an area where some large trees had fallen down
51282 so theres a big hole in the tree canopy so theres a lot of light getting down to the ground and theres a lot of vegetation growing there
51283 but as im walking i could see a patch of bare soil that didnt look quite right and when i got closer i could tell it had been cleared and some plants had been planted they looked like theyd been grown somewhere else and then actually replanted in the park
51284 ive seen pictures of the leaves before ive actually seen marijuana plants before too and i was a little surprised to see them right there theyve been found in the park before but its been a long time
51285 i called the police to come see because i knew theyd be interested in that
51286 it means that some 98 000 pages of evidence which the state confiscated in raids on mr zumas homes and also those of his legal adviser at the time two of his legal advisers can be used as evidence against him in the corruption trial which is scheduled to get underway next week
51287 it flows out of the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser schabir sheik and it revolves around money that was said to have been solicited by zuma in order that he would intervene on behalf of a company bidding for parts of south africas arms deal
51288 on these particular matters yes but he will next week seek to have the entire case thrown out of court when his trial is due to begin in kwazulu natal province in pietermartizburg there are also other applications pending one in mauritius another in the united kingdom where he is seeking to have the release of documents to the national prosecuting authority blocked
51289 tai dont you like chocolate milk i like chocolate milk
51290 but regular milk is good for me so i drink regular milk
51291 the situation has become critical and threatens the safety and security of the nation and its residents
51292 we are deeply disturbed by this imminent loss of communications service to vital public safety agencies
51293 in just a few days the navajo nation will lose its entire communications network including its public safety network as a byproduct of usacs mishandling of this matter
51294 sadly mothers are also no longer able to reach out and communicate with their children at war in iraq
51295 an internal navajo nation audit conducted during the summer of 2007 found problems with the contract between navajo nation and onsat and the bidding process that led to it
51296 the navajo nation is a place where you often can only get satellite connections and that is very expensive
51297 very little of that has been proven to be wasted it is a very complicated system so lots of schools are just unable to do the applications correctly
51298 if you have a life threatening situation with a student you might not be able to call 911
51299 for people who dont have a phone line or wireless which is a large number of people around here the nearest place to access the internet is probably page ariz which is about 60 miles away
51300 i think with the price of gas going up more people have been asking about the internet
51301 they didnt notice not having it but then they relied on it
51302 it became a real issue when it got switched off people were really upset there isnt really anywhere else around here for a lot of people to get online
51303 each and every mujahid belongs to this very soil of india
51304 the united states and israel share deep concern about irans nuclear program and the two delegations discussed steps to strengthen diplomatic efforts and financial measures to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability
51305 we also reaffirmed our strong mutual determination to counter irans support for terrorism
51306 on sunday he said on national television that to solve social security everythings on the table which of course means raising payroll taxes
51307 ten billion dollars today will as from august 1 be revalued to one zimdollar dollar
51308 general petraeus and ambassador to iraq ryan crocker caution that the progress is still reversible but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
51309 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
51310 and in the months ahead the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
51311 on the folly of rewarding a while hoping for b
51312 we were a company with a lot of engineers analytical people and pretty introspective we hadnt looked outside the business at the customer and we hadnt understood the importance of the customer
51313 how do you get 6 000 peoples minds aligned to the strategy how do you get the functions people are performing aligned with the businesses they were supporting the bsl became my key communication vehicle for reporting planning and budgeting processes it shifted us from a bureaucratic autocratic top down company with people working within organizational silos to one that was streamlined and participatory had top down and bottom up communication and one with people that worked across organizational boundaries
51314 people told you what they did last month and what they were going to do next month it was show and tell with no focus operational reviews and discussions of tactical issues dominate the typical meeting little time is left for strategic issues
51315 how you conduct the meeting and how you react to the reported numbers is tremendously important in the past the person reporting an unfavorable number was lonely and isolated now i want people to admit to shortfalls and have everyone else respond how can we help this is an entirely new management model for the company were sharing information and working together as a team to improve operations and fix problems this monthly meeting has become so interesting people started to ask me if they could attend i could sell tickets to it
51316 its overwhelming and theres a lot to think about but i think im pretty confident in the show
51317 she says selena says that theres responsibility in having kids looking up to her but her mom keeps her grounded
51318 see it s not the wings that make the angel
51319 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
51320 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
51321 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
51322 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
51323 we hope that iran will choose cooperation instead of increasing isolation and will give us in the following days a response that the international community is waiting for
51324 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
51325 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
51326 i hate it has taken so long a period of time to move toward resolution of ed dossetts death
51327 justice doesnt always move this slow but at least it is moving forward
51328 it was a failure of institutional inclination saving danieal was just too much trouble
51329 he did not complete a single investigation or risk assessment
51330 indeed his file on the family was buried at the bottom of a filing cabinet sized box beneath food wrappers and unopened envelopes relating to other childrens cases
51331 the statement that somehow the web has not been mobile until the iphone showed up is absurd
51332 in six days we had 350 000 installs on the iphone
51333 what the nose knows the science of scent in everyday life
51334 we are nearly on our side if we get out of this it will be a miracle i am so scared
51335 she has always been there for me and i thought this was a good chance to do something nice for her
51336 dad will be okay but not 100 per cent sure about mum but they have gone through quite a lot in their lives so they will get through this no worries
51337 the one thing none of us can do anything about is the weather
51338 weve taken this action as a prudent response to the current extraoridnary market conditions that have resulted in higher than usual redemptions in the fund not matched by fresh investment
51339 because property is a long term investment and the assets are not immediately realisable these types of provisions are common to these types of funds to ensure that the interests of investors are protected during periods of market volatility
51340 in the current market where investors are looking to reduce their exposure to property investments we believe we are acting in the best interests of investors by temporarily suspending activity to preserve the quality of the fund
51341 this is just like london i have to move here
51342 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
51343 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
51344 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
51345 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
51346 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
51347 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
51348 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
51349 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
51350 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
51351 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
51352 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
51353 oh and how about these cubes i guess they are some hot shot designer
51354 mexico was a net corn exporter before mexico submitted herself to free trade alliance with north america due to its free trade pact it was gradually reduced into a net corn importer the local farmers could not compete with north americans subsidised import 25 state subsidy imf and the world bank made sure that mexico did comply with the conditions of free trade while conveniently ignoring north american subsided corn mexican farmers were forced out of business and mexico became highly dependent on american corn trade
51355 i realized today i love strange pussy more than i love eating

51375 en ning n momento se dice que las obras deben ejecutarse en dicho plazo sino que en el plazo de seis meses deben iniciarse las obras tiempo m s que suficiente para tramitar los procedimientos que como entidad p blica empresarial correspondan
51376 en cualquier caso y siempre fundamentadamente si la tramitaci n de la adjudicaci n de las obras ordenadas se dilatara en el tiempo adif puede solicitar una ampliaci n del plazo otorgado para el inicio de las mismas

51391 temas interesantes y soslaya cuestiones que a mucha gente le puedan resultar lesivas

51443 all things have been handed over to me by my father
51444 and no one knows the son except the father nor does anyone know the father except the son and anyone to whom the son wills to reveal him
51445 truly truly i say to you an hour is coming and now is when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live for just as the father has life in himself even so he gave to the son also to have life in himself
51446 this sickness is not to end in death but for the glory of god so that the son of god may be glorified by it
51447 the jews answered pilate we have a law and by that law he ought to die because he made himself out to be the son of god
51448 the jews sought all the more to kill him because he not only broke the sabbath but also said that god was his father making himself equal with god
51449 he trusts in god let god rescue him now if he delights in him for he said i am the son of god

51453 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
51454 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
51455 sam qualified this moments later when he realised he had been taken out of context
51456 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment
51457 i think it was a slip i understood what he said i didnt take the double meaning in it i understand why people might
51458 i know james brayshaw did and he took it up with sam
51459 im starting to really in some ways sort of question if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair
51460 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think youve got to take him on face value
51461 yet when i try to do so i get a 403 forbidden error
51462 the officials also went along with a motion brought forth by tarboro town manager sam noble who serves as the chairman of electricities board of directors to eliminate the 1 000 a month payment to board members he said that will save about 100 000 a year board members will receive mileage for going to the meetings and there is normally food served at them
51463 noble said the board also will be carefully scrutinizing the 2009 budget to
51464 of the 103 electricities full and part time employees 29 earn six figure salaries and 23 earn between 80 000 and 100 000 a year
51465 noble told the city leaders that tiltons job performance and salary also will soon be evaluated
51466 kenneth m raber senior vice president of electricities services north carolina eastern municipal power agency who made the presentation to city officials on wednesday said before the meeting that even if electricities staff was cut in half it still would not save enough money to impact the customers electric rates
51467 noble told officials it would be fiscally irresponsible not to approve of the 14 percent increase
51468 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him

51479 hes a heavy drinker and sometimes when he drinks he changes and gets real nasty
51480 he was crouched down ready to pounce on me and he was scaring me he jumped up and grabbed me by my face and grabbed my nose and bit it off
51481 run a respectful campaign focused on the issues and values that are important to the american people
51482 do the american people want to elect the worlds biggest celebrity or do they want to elect an american hero
51483 sinister overtones a ham handed attempt to belittle mr obama as a person that brings back unpleasant memories
51484 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
51485 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

51487 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream

51489 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
51490 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
51491 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus

51496 i would take his call now i will take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
51497 if obama is running around talking about change maybe this is the year of change
51498 this is our opportunity lets take the word change yes lets change the system in california because there needs to be change
51499 hes never been afraid to throw nominees under the bus
51500 in his own election in 06 you know he abandoned every republican on the ticket so the fact that hes wishy washy in his comments now is nothing new for him
51501 i think that we are off to a great start in terms of providing a safe and secure environment for our students and i think with the boards support well continue to move forward and provide the safety that the parents think their kids should have

51512 madden does give you a feel for who some of the good players are

51523 hes played the broadmoor probably more times than i have the last five or 10 years
51524 he knows how to read the greens if i get confused or get into a problem he knows my game
51525 hes got a tough time coming up obviously and i think if you asked him he would say he wouldnt want to be anyplace else
51526 hes got a tough week in front of him this will be easy for him
51527 i made three or four really poor swings on the back
51528 i think i under clubbed 10 half a club and it cost me three shots from the middle of the fairway and you just cant do that out here
51529 its great to have him out there he knows the game and he understands me and i dont know what more you can get out of a caddie than that
51530 i spent about 3 1 2 hours just stretching before i even went to the range just trying to get loose
51531 its not even my knee i cant even bend down to line up a putt because my thighs hurt so much

51536 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
51537 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
51538 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
51539 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
51540 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
51541 i believe he is much better now than he was then
51542 thats where i think the bulk of the liability will fall on the driver of the van
51543 then you can go and say what caused the driver to lose control it could be that he was driving too fast for the conditions it could be that the tires werent good and thats where the other potential individuals come into play
51544 driver error appears to be a major contributing factor in the crash
51545 the practice is to serve anyone who touched that van in any way
51546 theyll look primarily at the driver but theyll go with the school district which is the province and perhaps the company that did the inspection
51547 our board made a very solid choice in john for our leadership position
51548 he possesses an exceptional track record in reaching out forming collaborations and hes committed to working with other animal welfare organizations to put animals first and foremost
51549 as an animal welfare proponent this opportunity brings my love of animals and my commitment to working with people in harmony together to accomplish significant things for the community
51550 i think we would fit in very very well and would like to be contributing to the community
51551 and of course it also provides jobs for people in redwood city too
51552 we want this to be a place that our employees like to go to

51556 i grew up going to the fair and realize how important it is for my companies to be associated with the fair as a show of support for our community our customers now expect us to continue sponsoring eastgate chrysler jeep amp westgate chrysler jeep dodge day at the fair
51557 whats great is that these organizations are more than just sponsors they are our partners
51558 we work with each other to maximize the benefits on both ends
51559 they help us put on a great event by providing programming exhibits and attractions for the people of indiana and we provide a wonderful platform for them to enhance their community marketing efforts and reach their audience

51592 the utterances of burns clearly shows that india cannot escape the provisions of the contentious hyde act of the us linking suspension of nuclear fuel supply to future atomic tests by india
51593 when this agreement was negotiated it was fully including the 123 agreement consistent with all provisions of the hyde act and the united states would retain of course under our law the right to implement every aspect of the atomic energy act of 1954
51594 what rights would the united states have under a hypothetical if india did x y or z all those rights are in place we have the right to termination if we want to if it comes to that it probably would not
51595 the 123 agreement does not supersede the hyde act its a complement and necessary part
51596 no aspect of this deal recognises india as a nuclear weapons state

51603 the numbers that the method used for calculation of the impact fees generated even i will admit were somewhat mind numbing in relation to going from no road fees to a set schedule of fees
51604 now 30 months down the road special interest groups in alliance with some elected city officials have made every effort to derail what they presume is our task
51605 ill be the first to admit were in over our heads here we need to back off and slow down
51606 are we really going to see the kind of growth projected
51607 id really like to see us scale down on this model
51608 we cannot support these kinds of fees we need to revisit this whole thing
51609 id really like to see similar sized cities used for comparison purposes
51610 i cant swallow 5 6 per square foot additional costs on a commercial building to try and fund these projects
51611 we need ideas on how to fund these things to avoid gridlock
51612 all of these roads identified for inclusion in the impact fees are ndot roads
51613 one of ndots goals is to reduce its inventory of roads which drastically reduces their maintenance expense my recommendation would be that we engage in discussions with ndot for the city to take over ownership of some of these roads and in exchange they would help us finish the needed improvements

51657 i am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that
51658 i have proudly served this nation and alaska for over 50 years
51659 weve never worked with a man so easy to get along with as unnamed veco employee plus everyone whos seen the place wants to know who has done the things hes done you and person a have been the spark plugs and we are really pleased with all you have done hope to see you and the chalet soon best teds
51660 i know ted stevens to be an honorable hard working alaskan who has served our state well for as long as we have been a state
51661 as to the charges we are at the beginning of the criminal process and there is a judicial procedure in place that will be followed
51662 in our legal system a man is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law as far as i am concerned ted stevens remains my friend i believe in him
51663 my personal reaction is that a tiny decline in real gdp in late 07 when employment was still rising followed by growth in the first two quarters of 08 is a doubtful basis for finding a peak in the fall of 07
51664 i dont agree that the evidence is getting clearer i expect that the committee will continue to monitor the data and wait until we can take our usual clear look at retrospective data
51665 this confirms the general picture of weakness but it is surprising that gdp declined
51666 we are still sliding into recession the second quarter got a small boost from the tax rebates and a big boost from exports but real domestic purchases fell significantly in the second quarter
51667 the little boost that we got from the tax rebates we will give up in the third in fourth quarters its going to continue to be a weak economy
51668 if we do end up dating the recession as beginning at the end of last year it could be a very long recession
51669 many will stamp the recession as having begun in the fourth quarter
51670 even though the first quarter was an up quarter there are still factors to lead the nber to characterize the economy as in a recession
51671 were in a recession its going to widen its going to deepen
51672 were going to have a long period of stagnation well into 2009
51673 we dont have the traditional back to back quarters yet
51674 those back to back quarters will come in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year
51675 i dont put really any particular weight on the downward revision on q4
51676 weve had basically a gdp report that did very little in changing the profile and how we think about the economy over the past three years
51677 i think the q2 result was a very satisfying one its a good quarterly result
51678 the labor market data signal the economy went into recession in december of last year
51679 you still cant figure out what i am thinking i have to tell you everything
51680 i asked her im waiting for an answer i dont know if she likes me or not how should i know
51681 i dont think you should wait for me i think you deserve better than me

51694 madden does give you a feel for who some of the good players are

51714 what he can do for a lineup that cant be disputed
51715 i think where hes at contractually and what he wants to prove
51716 its tough to turn down a player of this caliber at this time of year
51717 he has produced in the clutch on the biggest stage the world series for us to be able to add a player of this quality its very fortunate

51732 i was upset because people confined to wheelchairs were not getting down either
51733 it might differ by building but the policy directs handicapped people to go to the lobby near an elevator and fire personnel will help you
51734 we do have an evacuation plan for all of our buildings if the plan was not implemented properly we would have a concern we would reach out to judge jeremiah to determine what happened
51735 in guiding the selection of the next education commissioner the members of this committee will have a profound effect on the future course of public education in rhode island
51736 if i was on a jury and had to decide beyond a reasonable doubt i dont know how i would decide this case
51737 bordering on overwhelming patience with a case that had at this level more than enough support to satisfy the standard
51738 disappointed in the sense that i felt we made a pretty strong case that the case should not go up on second degree murder
51739 we dont think the evidence points to anything like that even in the light most favorable to the prosecution these were kids 17 years old screwing around on the water and for most of the day acting pretty responsibly
51740 where the consequences may not be foreseen but should have been
51741 but we had an opportunity to listen to their key witness
51742 it was a learning process and it helps us prepare for the next step
51743 have done well but its difficult i cant fully understand what its like to learn about what happened to your son for the first time
51744 all they talk about is the truth coming out and justice
51745 a nightmare that any parent doesnt want to ever face
51746 no substantial evidence that ryan greenberg committed second degree murder
51747 you had six adults picking on a little kid 17 years old
51748 thats the worst piece of police work ive seen in a long time
51749 it was not poor little brendan sitting there with a light over his head with six cops he had an experienced attorney richard ratcliffe there with him

51752 we can move them a block or two and not 200 miles
51753 guess what it aint happening it is so dysfunctional the governance of this state that were reduced to talking about economic development in terms of moving jobs around
51754 but im not sure that just again moving government jobs around should satisfy us that were doing adequate economic development thats not economic development
51755 if anyone was lying and making up stories it was botas and viveiros
51756 the defendants thought they were better than their captives they could do what they wanted to do what a sense of power what a sense of entitlement
51757 while everyone has been worried about the subprime it has become clear that the problem for japanese banks is not the subprime but everything else

51787 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
51788 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it

51791 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
51792 its like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room
51793 it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
51794 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
51795 now that we are learning how these drugs actually work
51796 we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects
51797 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
51798 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
51799 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
51800 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes
51801 the successful commercial printer of the future will offer service that is customized to their clients specific needs by taking full advantage of all the technologies from offset printing to new media at their disposal
51802 graph expos value to attendees lies in the opportunity it provides to not only evaluate the latest graphic communications technology first hand on the show floor but also to learn in our many educational sessions how to apply them to gain the greatest business success
51803 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
51804 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
51805 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
51806 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
51807 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
51808 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
51809 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
51810 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
51811 who are open to doing something on the production side
51812 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
51813 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
51814 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
51815 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
51816 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

51818 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
51819 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
51820 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
51821 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
51822 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
51823 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
51824 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
51825 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
51826 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
51827 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
51828 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
51829 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
51830 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
51831 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
51832 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
51833 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
51834 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
51835 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
51836 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
51837 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
51838 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
51839 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
51840 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
51841 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
51842 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
51843 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
51844 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
51845 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
51846 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
51847 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
51848 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
51849 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
51850 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
51851 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
51852 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
51853 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
51854 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
51855 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
51856 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
51857 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
51858 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
51859 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
51860 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
51861 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
51862 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
51863 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
51864 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
51865 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
51866 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
51867 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
51868 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
51869 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
51870 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
51871 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity
51872 it was better than i expected the organisation was great and the music and atmosphere were fantastic
51873 i was determined to make the impossible possible and i had a lot of pressure riding on the success of the implant
51874 if it didnt work i would have been out on the streets
51875 if it rains again next year ill surrender to the traditional weather of xaviers birthday and stop planning parties in the backyard
51876 im male 34 australian and pretty well travelled and educated im mainly into history culture and hiking i also like to drink beer
51877 anyone male or female between about 25 and 40 is alright by me
51878 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
51879 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
51880 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
51881 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since
51882 im like a nail stuck in the wrist of their christmas

51886 fanfiction existed before the internet so its entirely possible nadia would be writing it even without the computer what she wouldnt have is the community that the internet brings
51887 the absolutely true diary of a part time indian was last years big ya book what i find so fascinating about that situation is that alexie published another book last year with a teenage main character a wonderful unique magical book called flight flight however was published as an adult book whats going on here
51888 even the most timorous teenage girl couldnt conceive of bella as intimidating its hard to imagine a person more insecure or a situation better set up to magnify her insecurities
51889 no you cant do that but you can do this
51890 you must be doing it wrong rick its dirty and disgusting
51891 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
51892 our best estimation on what caused the low oxygen was what is called a summer kill situation
51893 what happens during the warm sunny weather is you get rapid growth algae in a pond and thats fine as long as its sunny because photosynthesis produces plenty of oxygen in the water
51894 more oxygen is used up and theres less for fish and the fish will suffocate
51895 any pond in an urban setting is going to receive a fair amount of runoff especially during high rainfall events and that will be another input of nutrients from urban sources around that pond such as lawn fertilizer
51896 but the main problem at pier park pond is nutrients from waterfowl
51897 some cities have adopted plans to deal with waterfowl and i think grand island ought to do that if they want to sustain a decent fish population in that lake
51898 they bullhead are more tolerant to low oxygen conditions and i doubt that we will see any dead ones but i dont know how bad it will get
51899 in many cases that helps to avoid situations like what happened at pier park pond unless the algae complexes are just too abundant and theres too much nutrients and algae growth and those aerations and fountains are not able to keep up
51900 pier park pond is by far the worst in grand island
51901 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
51902 it was really the case of the steering failing on the ship as it was going around on the bend going out of the harbour
51903 theres three ships in the port loading and two waiting to come in so we are attempting to refloat the vessel
51904 well be able to pull the vessel off this morning hopefully
51905 if that doesnt work the next high tide is around the same time tomorrow morning so well try additional measures and maybe some additional vessels
51906 theres at the moment no evidence of her taking water and theres no oil spills

51908 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity

51910 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
51911 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
51912 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
51913 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
51914 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
51915 were expecting to have a big crowd 60 to 70 boats

51929 shanie is well qualified to lead the organization and will bring a fresh outlook to all the programs
51930 we are of the view that it would be singularly unwise to be committing australian men and women into theatres of operation without a clear understanding why we are going there what and how we are seeking to achieve it and when the job is done and when the men and women are coming home
51931 it would just be bad bad policy to do that
51932 the relevant agencies were unable to provide us with the level of mental health data the level of detail that we required
51933 you feel that you have done 120 per cent for the australian defence force and the country and when you come back you become ill and all the adf seem to be doing is wanting to get rid of you
51934 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
51935 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
51936 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
51937 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
51938 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
51939 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
51940 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
51941 take readers on a journey through their celebrated young lives pausing to reflect on what has helped shape them into who they are today
51942 they interviewed 20 people and wrote brief essays about each other in each interview the girls explore what inspired the interviewee
51943 we interviewed the people who have inspired us with the hope that they will inspire and teach others
51944 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
51945 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
51946 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
51947 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
51948 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
51949 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
51950 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
51951 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
51952 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
51953 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

52042 what this means is that in the case of a 20 year loan a 25 bps basis points hike will mean the emi going up by rs 17 for every rs 1 lakh rs 100 000 loan amount in case of a 50 bps hike it will be rs 34 and in case of 75 bps the emi will rise by rs 51
52043 similarly if it is a 15 year loan a 25 bps hike will push up emi by rs 16 a month a 50 bps hike by rs 33 and a 75 bps hike by rs 50
52044 my monthly budget is in a mess i am already paying rs 1 500 more emi from last month and another hike will make situation very difficult for me
52045 for instance in the case of state bank of india the interest rate reset happens at the end of every two years from the date the loan has been disbursed for bank of india the reset is at the end of every five years

52050 nine out of ten of these smes just want to be happy and see chasing an extra dollar by growing their business as getting in the way of that pursuit
52051 the underlying primary motivation for smes managing their capital structure is to seek peace or happiness
52052 these findings describe a capital structure theory that is not a byproduct of the wealth maximisation imperative but rather a window or a reflection of peace seeking financial behaviour
52053 the fact that new zealand is a country of smes warms my heart
52054 in listed companies shareholders and managers are separate and the only reason that shareholders pool their resources to give to managers is to maximise wealth

52303 sudah minum susu jangan sampai lupa lo ini demi janinmu
52304 memang ibu hamil perlu makanan tambahan si ibu kan bukan cuma memberi makan dirinya tapi juga janinnya
52305 jadi bisa dibilang susu adalah makanan yang hampir sempurna hingga bisa dijadikan alternatif untuk mencukupi kebutuhan tambahan makanan bagi ibu hamil
52306 kekurangan zat besi akan membuat si ibu mengalami anemia dan mempengaruhi kecerdasan si janin
52307 pada sayuran dan kulit ari beras ada serat yang namanya asam fitat asam fitat inilah yang menghambat penyerapan dari kalsium itu
52308 bukankah bb yang meningkat juga berarti mengundang bahaya lain lagi
52309 tak mengapa kekurangannya itu diberikan dalam bentuk susu kita hitung makanan pokok yang masuk ada berapa dan kebutuhan dia seberapa lalu kita ambil selisihnya tentunya kebutuhan per individu ibu hamil tak sama tergantung bb dan tb si ibu bila dia butuh 2000 kkal misal sedangkan makanan yang masuk hanya 1000 kkal dan yang 1000 kkal nya lagi terbuang akibat muntah muntah nah kekurangannya ini bisa dipenuhi dengan susu
52310 jadi bila kebutuhan gizi si ibu kurang ya bayi juga bisa terkena bblr atau berat badan lahir rendah yang akan berdampak pada kualitas si bayi selanjutnya
52311 walaupun kalau dilihat dari pola makan ibu ibu di negara kita sebenarnya kekurangan asam folat ini jarang terjadi karena ibu ibu kita sering makan kacang kacangan seperti tempe dan tahu
52312 toh kandungannya tak beda dengan susu full cream biasa asalkan jangan yang skim karena berarti lemaknya sudah dibuang padahal lemak salah satu sumber energi pula

52320 mccains pow experience is unique awe inspiring and timeless but it isnt timely

52324 mccain has not predicated his campaign on his identity or personal story

52380 avoid a collision given the circumstances of what happened that night
52381 an independent review of the case by crown counsel was conducted and through that review the crown concluded the drivers actions did not constitute an offence
52382 there is no evidence that alcohol and or drugs were factors in the crash
52383 there is no evidence that fatigue played a role nor was there any evidence that a medical condition including eyesight contributed to the collision
52384 the age of the driver was one of the things taken into consideration relative to driver reaction times
52385 caused and continue to cause plantiff great mental physical and nervous pain and suffering

52391 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
52392 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
52393 he has yet to show any remorse for what he has done he has not cried or expressed regret of any kind
52394 he has told us that he and cara argued on friday after she threatened to go to the police to accuse him of being a drug trafficker he has told us he murdered her on saturday night left her body in the bath and went to a party before decapitating her the following day
52395 the murder was premeditated he turned the music up on the stereo moments before the crime so neigh bours wouldnt hear her screaming
52396 he took various photos of the chopped up body with his cellphone camera including photos like those of the tale ban where the decapitated head is placed on top of the body
52397 its probable that he was interested in getting married in order to allow him to stay in the uk
52398 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
52399 it is difficult to think of anything other than the threat of unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity of the extradition process as to require the accused to be discharged irrespective of the case against him
52400 sometimes people dont go just to watch the football they will come to abuse people like me
52401 i know there will be plenty of banter but i will enjoy that thats what you want as a footballer there are enough boring things in life you want it to be entertaining
52402 the first shirt i ever got was a tottenham shirt with gazza on the back he was everything to me a footballer who enjoyed his life and played with freedom
52403 i want fans to come and enjoy watching me and my team but i know i have to earn the right
52404 he is someone who is going to get the best out of me he has been there and done it and i have great respect for him
52405 i have seen what he has done with the other players i talked to the lads before i came here he can develop my game and push me on to the next level they were saying hes great its hard work and thats what i want i want to enjoy myself and work hard
52406 tottenham came in with a bid for stephen and the player is very keen to go i would like to have kept him but it is a move which appeals to him and we wish him well
52407 the greatest tragedy is the premature and violent death of laura milne
52408 this was a horrific and cruel assault on a defenceless young woman
52409 this was a terrible crime which merits a sentence at the top end of the range it is difficult to comprehend the evil that lay behind this attack
52410 we are appalled that such a horrific crime has resulted in such a lenient sentence
52411 they all played a part in lauras death and in our opinion debbie buchan and leigh mackinnon should have had significantly higher sentences
52412 yet again the judicial system has let innocent victims down it is no wonder we are experiencing increased levels of serious crime with the apparent lack of punishment
52413 no sentence will ever bring laura back to us or erase from our minds the memory of what they did to her we will have to live with this for the rest of our lives debbie buchan and leigh mackinnon could be out walking the streets again in just six years
52414 mr jack is at a loss really to explain how it was that he allowed himself to be drawn into this matter that resulted in him doing those things for which he has accepted responsibility
52415 an immature young girl who was unemployed and didnt have much to do with her time
52416 she mixed with the wrong people and was easily led
52417 she accepts she has to take responsibility for what was done by the group
52418 the thoughts of the cyrenians staff are with laura milnes family we hope this verdict brings them some kind of closure
52419 the cyrenians as an organisation are now looking to put this tragic situation behind us and look to the future
52420 this is a tragic case involving a vulnerable young lady who had clearly sought friendship from those who were ultimately convicted
52421 those are lies i do not comment on any longer
52422 i negotiated a very tough deal he had to step down immediately from both his posts as president of the serb part of bosnia and as head of his party and he did so

52434 the goal of the project is to develop efficient algae production systems that allow for the capture of emissions from coal burning power plants and then to extract the algae oil from the biomass and produce biodiesel using the mcgyan process this technology could then one day be transferred to the farm the potential for biodiesel production from algae is vast using less than 3 of our current crop land we could produce the 63 billion gallons of bio diesel fuel that we currently need in the united states thus all of our diesel fuel could be produced domestically this would also have a tremendous effect on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and solve the issue of food versus fuel since algae is not a food and it can be grown on land that is not used for food production
52435 we need x ramirez does x well so well look past y and z
52436 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
52437 latroy gives us another experienced quality arm for our bullpen
52438 we tried to sign him during the offseason and lost out to the yankees but we are happy to have him here for the remainder of the season he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
52439 it was one of those things where if i ever got the chance to play for the yankees i certainly didnt want to pass up on that opportunity
52440 no disrespect to the astros or anything like that but it was one of those things that i wanted to do at one point in my career and the opportunity presented itself
52441 we ended up getting a deal done for an experienced relief pitcher who we think can go back on the back end and help brocail and sampson and the other guys who weve been using late and help us get the job done
52442 i told myself that i was going to stay in shape
52443 if i got traded i got traded or if i had to wait the full 10 days and get released and then sign with another team that was the way i was going to go i just wanted the chance to pitch again this year
52444 he seemed very pleased with the opportunity hes going to get here
52445 the reason were not disappointed is that this is an ongoing process
52446 will not be an impediment to what we need to do
52447 well meet with the staff friday and see how we introduce the younger kids and who has to take a backseat because of that
52448 they all have a good relationship with the ballclub and the manager and us in the front office
52449 they understand the program they dont have any problem with the path were following
52450 to take the pressure off bochy and to make sure everybodys on the same page he understands that
52451 we did all the work and there was no interest
52452 ive enjoyed my years for the giants ive been waiting for an opportunity like this where they say ok youre going to be one of our lefty guys youre going to help us out of jams in the seventh or eighth and help brian wilson out thats something i wanted here to have the team youre with be committed to you is a boost
52453 but early on i knew that wasnt going to happen it didnt take the last couple of days to figure out that wasnt going to happen that type of player wasnt moved so that should tell you what kind of climate it was
52454 we wanted to add some depth to the bullpen some experience
52455 its a deal we started talking about last weekend and it came together this morning
52456 we felt the opportunity to acquire a young pitcher made sense as we look toward 2009 and beyond
52457 pedro grifol our minor league field coordinator has known gaby for several years and believes he has a chance to help us in the future
52458 thanks to the truce it is not impossible to imagine nokia phones with qualcomms brew os nokia according to some of my sources feels that a feeble motorola is ready to be knocked over from its strong position with two cdma carriers sprint and verizon
52459 a lack of a strong smart phone to compete against the apple iphone and upcoming new handsets from blackberry maker research in motion is adding to motorolas woes
52460 stripped down acoustic anti folk series of short stories set against a background of acoustic guitar and poetical raps
52461 theres a wide variety of themes here from the loss of my culture to rap to the possibility of monkeys overruling the earth
52462 im aware that chloe may have no memory of me at all shes too young but i want her to know that i was the first man ever to fall in love with her
52463 i had actually started crying and i said to the other people that i was golfing with you must think im just crazy assuming this but i just have this really bad feeling i felt he had gone down in the bridge i just i felt it
52464 and i kind of explained to them that there was a bad accident and that the bridge fell down and daddy was on the bridge and died so now he is with grandpa in heaven
52465 you can never put enough money on somebodys life i mean i wouldnt care how much money you gave me it wouldnt give me what i had with my husband
52466 its been almost a year but there is not a day that goes by that i dont talk to him or i think about him and its not just once a day its many times a day it just doesnt change in a years time i think some people think ok the first year is over you can move on and it doesnt work that way
52467 hundreds of regular minnesotans ran toward pain and danger and saved many many lives
52468 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
52469 he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
52470 the team is playing well at this point but being able to add a player like mark teixeira just makes us that much better
52471 we have too many players hurt right now to really compete
52472 weve never been sellers before were usually the ones adding not subtracting
52473 i told my teammates in atlanta good luck but at the same time i have a chance to win a world series with the angels
52474 hopefully i can just go over there and be one more piece of the puzzle
52475 the last couple days i knew it was coming so i prepared for it
52476 its a little bittersweet i really enjoyed my time here
52477 theyve always had great pitching great defense and find a way to win games
52478 i want to be the one who hopefully gets them over the top
52479 im not making any predictions im not saying were the team to beat
52480 im just excited to go to atlanta and play for manager bobby cox
52481 at the same time my teammates here to leave them ill be pulling for them
52482 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
52483 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
52484 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
52485 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
52486 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
52487 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
52488 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
52489 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
52490 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
52491 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
52492 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
52493 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
52494 your taste buds are sure to blast off with firecracker exploding pops each of the mouth watering flavors of blue raspberry bang cherry collision and cola blast have a cherry flavored tip packed with popping candies and bursting with excitement
52495 of course i have well you know at first i thought im not happy with the way the chinese are treating the tibetans and ive been concerned with should we have the olympics because theyre not being nice to the
52496 harming chinese people when she suggested the catastrophic quake last may was
52497 for the families who have lost their loved ones or lost limbs or suffered severe injuries your statement and act has caused extreme emotional distress
52498 when youre facing good pitching you need to find a way to score were getting shut down too frequently
52499 the dynamic is not like that as far as our personnel
52500 other teams ive been on they do that it hasnt happened here yet it doesnt mean guys arent frustrated it means we go about it in a different way

52519 i am happy for the children who have an opportunity to experience new trier on a daily basis shouldnt all children have the same opportunity
52520 when a public school fails parents ask only for a choice in the education of their children no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity
52521 obviously the lead from the us overnight wasnt particularly good
52522 the us has a tendency to move a couple of per cent either way each day at the moment so the volatility is quite extreme
52523 the only sectors which are offering any excitment is the energy sector
52524 things are still a little bit grim at the moment
52525 we have 213 actually recording as we speak here today
52526 were able to view the recorded image of the crime going down and surely that helped in the investigation

52542 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family
52543 it wont be lost on religious conservatives that the mccain campaign used the kind of gender neutral language about families that could be found on the website of the national gay amp lesbian task force
52544 do you think gay parents are just as good for a child as a mother and father
52545 do you think that once a child is up for adoption because his mother and father are out of the picture gay people should be allowed to adopt that child
52546 there are many abandoned children who have yet to find homes

52553 it was more of like there wasnt a lot of action it was more of its hard to explain down there action over there is like getting ied or maybe getting shot at a few times or a car bomb goes off its not exactly what youre expecting its more like hunting season youre the deer
52554 in my case i had lost a lot while i was over there and it just started the more you lose and the less they do for you the more you start to see how jacked up things really are
52555 and theres plenty they could do and they just they did nothing i lost a lot of money i lost my family while i was there you know pretty much and when i get back id lost so much it was like i needed to start over
52556 man i got to have a reset i got to find a way to get myself out of this and start over start my life over you know i have nothing to work with

52567 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people
52568 arrangement in black and gray portrait of the artists mother
52569 all he said was i heard about your son how good he is and told her shes doing a great job
52570 we consider this incident an inadvertent mistake we have contacted both the conference conference usa office and the ncaa with the information
52571 i havent told a lot of people about what im doing simply because i just think its what you do
52572 shes got three young grandchildren that she loves to play with and sometimes shes limited what she can do with them
52573 i felt like i grinded really well ive just got to shoot low tomorrow
52574 whether it was the right decision or wrong decision it is a decision i made
52575 im not going to think about what other people think about me all im going to think about is how im going to shoot a better score tomorrow and how im going to shoot a low number and i think a low number will take care of everything
52576 this is not a complex case and it should move quickly
52577 this is the first time in my life i have asked for a speedy trial
52578 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
52579 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
52580 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
52581 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
52582 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
52583 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
52584 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
52585 we much prefer to see the acquisition of an in market biologic franchise that the company is already familiar with as compared to a series of smaller riskier assets
52586 at a declarative level he seemed to understand that israel must divide the land but he couldnt act he was trapped by the hawkish elements of his coalition
52587 but the aftereffects of the war are very much with us
52588 olmert leaves behind grave damage to israels power of deterrence in the region and a feeling of demoralization and lost hope at home
52589 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
52590 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
52591 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
52592 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
52593 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
52594 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
52595 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
52596 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
52597 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
52598 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
52599 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom

52601 cows got skittish and grouped into a herd 20 seconds before the shaking
52602 its the sign of the times everyone took out their cell phones as soon as the shaking stopped
52603 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
52604 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
52605 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
52606 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
52607 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
52608 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
52609 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point
52610 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
52611 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
52612 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
52613 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
52614 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
52615 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
52616 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
52617 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
52618 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
52619 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
52620 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
52621 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
52622 in america you are not playing the race card when you acknowledge a very visible fact trollneequa commented on
52623 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
52624 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
52625 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
52626 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
52627 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
52628 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
52629 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
52630 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
52631 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
52632 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
52633 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
52634 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
52635 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
52636 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
52637 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
52638 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
52639 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
52640 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
52641 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
52642 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
52643 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
52644 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
52645 even though they have tweaked a number of rules for the game there is still a substantial amount of details that are similar
52646 its still a 15 by 15 board and you get seven letters with point value
52647 here they have changed some of the rules but the overall premise is pretty much the same
52648 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
52649 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
52650 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
52651 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
52652 my business is my life and im ok with that
52653 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
52654 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
52655 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
52656 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
52657 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
52658 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
52659 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
52660 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
52661 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
52662 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
52663 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
52664 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
52665 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
52666 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
52667 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
52668 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
52669 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
52670 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
52671 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
52672 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
52673 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
52674 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
52675 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
52676 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
52677 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
52678 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
52679 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
52680 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
52681 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
52682 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
52683 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
52684 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
52685 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
52686 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
52687 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
52688 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
52689 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
52690 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
52691 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
52692 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
52693 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
52694 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
52695 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
52696 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
52697 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
52698 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
52699 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
52700 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
52701 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
52702 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
52703 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
52704 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
52705 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
52706 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
52707 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
52708 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
52709 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
52710 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
52711 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
52712 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
52713 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
52714 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
52715 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
52716 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
52717 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
52718 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
52719 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
52720 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
52721 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
52722 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
52723 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
52724 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
52725 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
52726 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
52727 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
52728 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
52729 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
52730 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
52731 climate change is the greatest environmental crisis that humanity has ever faced but it is not the only serious challenge confronting us there is a simultaneous source problem known as peak oil arising from the depletion of the fuels we are burning particularly petroleum the solution to both climate change and peak oil is to develop renewable sources of energy to use less energy to use energy differently and to make this shift as rapidly as possible
52732 al gores ambitious goal provides a national focus and call to action now whats needed is a clear sighted plan for achieving it one that recognizes the complex issues of energy depletion the vulnerability of the supply chain and the limits of technology we are taking up gores call and presenting a powerful framework to realize this vision a vision that would revitalize america and make it genuinely sustainable
52733 al gores generational challenge to repower america which places energy at the forefront of the national agenda should be the top issue debated by all candidates this fall
52734 energy touches almost every critical issue facing our country including the economy security and the environment gores courageous and rational plan to move to 100 renewable energy sources in 10 years has my full support our 10 point plan provides the stepping stones to achieve this target
52735 we thank al gore for articulating the most urgent action needed to safeguard americas environmental economic and societal future and that of the entire world our mission is to get society off of fossil fuels fast and we embrace the need to move to 100 renewable energy with this plan
52736 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
52737 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
52738 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
52739 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
52740 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
52741 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
52742 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
52743 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
52744 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
52745 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
52746 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
52747 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
52748 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
52749 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
52750 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
52751 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
52752 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
52753 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
52754 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
52755 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
52756 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
52757 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
52758 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
52759 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
52760 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
52761 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
52762 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
52763 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
52764 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
52765 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
52766 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
52767 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
52768 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
52769 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
52770 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
52771 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
52772 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
52773 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
52774 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
52775 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
52776 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
52777 if the vice president says its do able i believe
52778 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
52779 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
52780 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
52781 our dangerous overreliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
52782 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
52783 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
52784 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege
52785 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
52786 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
52787 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
52788 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
52789 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
52790 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
52791 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
52792 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
52793 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
52794 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
52795 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
52796 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
52797 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
52798 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
52799 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
52800 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
52801 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
52802 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
52803 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
52804 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
52805 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
52806 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
52807 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
52808 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
52809 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
52810 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
52811 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
52812 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
52813 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
52814 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
52815 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
52816 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
52817 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
52818 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
52819 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
52820 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
52821 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
52822 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
52823 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
52824 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
52825 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
52826 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
52827 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
52828 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
52829 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
52830 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
52831 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
52832 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
52833 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
52834 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
52835 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
52836 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
52837 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
52838 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
52839 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
52840 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
52841 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
52842 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
52843 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
52844 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
52845 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
52846 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
52847 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
52848 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
52849 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
52850 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
52851 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
52852 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
52853 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
52854 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
52855 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
52856 i am an unyielding advocate for the well being of children around the world and do not condone or endorse smoking
52857 there are lots of false starts where the band cant get it together
52858 the rebellious nature at the heart of all great filmmaking
52859 so youll just come in here and there will be a bunch of chicks walking around in there
52860 do we find the unexpected caller a welcome guest or a frustrating interruption we deprive ourselves and others if we feel we must have the house free of clutter and our desks cleared of urgent business before we entertain guests a simple beverage and an attentive ear will honor a stranger or a friend
52861 even though they have tweaked a number of rules for the game there is still a substantial amount of details that are similar
52862 its still a 15 by 15 board and you get seven letters with point value
52863 here they have changed some of the rules but the overall premise is pretty much the same
52864 no fuimos porque el ministro quiere bajar en 10 por ciento la tabla de fletes y no aceptamos pedimos que se cumpla el decreto 2663 y la tabla seguimos en nuestra posici n firme de inmovilizaci n indefinida la ley no se negocia se debe cumplir a carta cabal eso es desconocer al se or presidente y no acatar lo que l ordena
52865 no hay bloqueos en sus accesos ni en las carreteras ni actos de vandalismo
52866 contrario de darnos periodos de gracia nos env a abogados y nos dicen que paguemos
52867 le expusimos las reservas en relaci n con estas medidas porque carecen de un sustento t cnico de costos estar amos de acuerdo y deseamos que se cumplan pero reconocemos que hay factores que atentan contra ellos y mientras no sean removidos no podemos cumplir ojal nos sentemos a la mesa e introduzcamos una serie de compromisos ahora lo vemos complicado
52868 teniendo como referencia los altos precios del petr leo y sus derivados en el mercado internacional el precio promedio del petr leo para el mes de julio estuvo alrededor de los 135 d lares por barril lo que motiva los incrementos aprobados

52874 a musical showcase featuring col jack moelmann and friends at the mighty wurlitzer theatre pipe organ
52875 one day back in february i looked in the mirror and said jack you have a dream go for it not to argue with myself i have personally rented radio city music hall for an organ program the likes of which has not been done in years if ever
52876 im going there to gratify myself by playing and to show off what the music hall has in the way of an organ
52877 we do not have any record of having rented the music hall directly to an individual in the past however we have no formal policy that would preclude us from doing so and all bookings are addressed on a case by case basis
52878 most rentals at carnegie hall are by professional orchestras and ensembles educational organizations or professional artists
52879 its very infrequent that an amateur would rent the hall particularly the main auditorium
52880 i really dont decide what im going to play until i get there and see whats going to work
52881 depending on the mood im in ive changed songs in the middle of the program
52882 we dont print exactly whats being played we announce it we talk in between the numbers make little jokes otherwise it gets kind of boring watching the back of somebody
52883 i was intrigued by it because i was also interested in electricity and electronics and the organ had a lot of buttons on it so i just went from there and have been doing it ever since as a hobby
52884 there are military people in the neighborhood and i outrank them
52885 oh good daddys in town im going to lie down
52886 the first song i learned was this land is your land
52887 shes a great gal great performer and one of those unsung local heroes who should get more attention
52888 im a professional musician or im broke im hoping to find freelance jobs that allow me to travel
52889 i was so touched by the value of creativity and for him it was all about the value of musical creativity
52890 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free it expects what never was and never will be

52892 dont act like a moron youll get nowhere in life stop acting like a putz straighten up act like a man dont sit there crying and screaming idiot
52893 i completely understand why it offended some parents and in particular parents of children with autism who feel that vaccines caused their illness
52894 for this i am truly sorry since my mom has parkinsons disease i know what it feels like to want a concrete cause and a concrete cure as soon as possible however i still believe that the decision not to vaccinate our children bodes for a dangerous future
52895 why would anyone want to go to italy there are no bars there
52896 of course it is timmy look at how far south it is
52897 right now were going to hold off on boarding until the plane gets here

52904 im just back from sedona i saw your aura and its definitely green
52905 all the chic women in san francisco should protest and start their own salon des refuses this is doubly ironic when you remember that bohemian glamour the dominant influence in fashion for the last few years has its origins in san francisco danielle steel vanessa getty sloane barnett and all the style mavens of san francisco should exact their revenge on graydon carter give him a fab new hairdo
52906 i f i poop on a city street t heres a soft scent like cinnamon and autumn leaves and roasted peanuts and snow a scent of childhood
52907 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
52908 gue harus pintar pintar ngolah keuangan nggak bisa culas kayak dulu lagi
52909 shes just naturally funny and very very down to earth
52910 she has said funny things just spur of the moment things from five years old
52911 in the back of my mind i always knew i was going to be a comedian i always wrote jokes down without even thinking about it
52912 at the time it felt great to win and right now i feel a little anxious because i really want to see who wins it feels good to be a comedian on the show
52913 shes very attractive but she never plays the sexy part shell make silly moves she does imitations and thats what people like about her
52914 i think women need to stop using the excuse oh im a female thats why no one likes me no youre not funny and thats why no one likes you
52915 wir unterst tzen voll das anliegen diejenigen zur verantwortung zu ziehen die f r die verbrechen und grausamkeiten in darfur verantwortlich sind

52931 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
52932 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
52933 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
52934 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
52935 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
52936 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
52937 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
52938 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
52939 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
52940 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
52941 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
52942 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
52943 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
52944 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
52945 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
52946 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
52947 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
52948 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
52949 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
52950 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
52951 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
52952 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
52953 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
52954 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
52955 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
52956 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
52957 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
52958 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
52959 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
52960 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
52961 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
52962 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
52963 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
52964 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
52965 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
52966 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
52967 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
52968 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
52969 milo greenwitch felt the weight of the titles he had acquired when the nexus fell keenly seer of the new age bane of the underworld and patron saint of the warrioresses these were not just empty words strung together but had real meaning and responsibilities now he was tired and for good reason after grandville had turned to nothing but a hole in the earth when the nexus went he had spent a year traversing the dark continent to look for a portion of the newly awakened warrioresses no rest and no time to mourn had been allowed he had to swallow the anguish at the losses of his fianc e and many of the newly made warrioresses in the nexus battle nevermind get over the betrayal of sebastian the bastard and himself by the first warrioress elizabeth and her lover the king of the vampires liamus the hope for a new beginning a new start in the small island town named miltons isle was just the change of place people and pace he was looking for that would maybe give him time to heal from all the wounds he now carried
52970 with everything weird that goes on in this town you actually like those type of books
52971 yeah kind of at least i like this author i dont know why ive been reading this series since it came out three years ago theres something about the relationships of alexander harringtons characters i really like the one between sebastian and milo even though the author writes like milo is straight it seems in the interactions between those two characters theres something more you know
52972 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
52973 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
52974 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
52975 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
52976 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
52977 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
52978 the web has become a civil space for citizens seeking change they can try to restrict the technology but we cubans are very adept
52979 my take is its ok as long as you have knowledge but how many celebrities do you know with a lot of knowledge so i dont encourage it
52980 b illboards in north tehran show american actor george clooney promoting omega watches
52981 iranian actors were displeased that they had been barred from such work
52982 artists can earn extra money only by doing these kinds of ads
52983 hey man all we represent to them man is somebody who needs a haircut
52984 i liked clinton but i voted for bush then and i voted for bush sr and im definitely voting for bush again
52985 your resignation saddens me when you want to run for president i will be there you have done so much more than anyone in a long time for our country make some money have a life come back kick ass
52986 2 of the most powerful and proven investing secrets of all time are pointing our small group to a peak oil bonanza
52987 peak oil profit play 1 is a leader in deep water drilling has 15 years of proven reserves and rights to explore and develop a region reputed to have billions of barrels of oil
52988 this out of the way oil company is a leader in deep water drilling has 15 years of reserves a plan to supercharge production and a strong dividend its domestic oil market is expected to grow 4 annually through 2010 thats double the world average and this company has what it takes to not only meet that demand but expand into the international arena as well in fact theyre gunning to hike total fuel production 7 8 annually during roughly that same time period thats a rate oil major peers cant even come close to
52989 are we talking exxon mobil chevron or shell here not a chance
52990 sales have grown at an annual rate of 17 over the past ten years so how come this stock isnt talked up on cnbc
52991 well even though you can buy these shares in the u s this company is headquartered overseas far enough away that its almost unknown or at least never talked about by mainstream u s investors
52992 peak oil profit play 3 expertise in extracting hard to get at oil and the potential to shoot up 30 in the not too distant future not to mention a dividend thats been growing like a weed
52993 this company is one of the worldwide leaders in deep water extraction and has a plateful of heavy oil projects heavy oil is the gritty gush the world is turning to as older wells are guzzled dry in other words this company is perfectly positioned to win big in the future of oil
52994 like the others you can still get this companys stock cheap if you act quickly its currently priced at just 8 times earnings and thats along with a solid 5 1 dividend per share
52995 peak oil profits 3 overlooked energy stocks ready to run
52996 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer vertically integrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins
52997 wall e is a big hit and has nearly made 200 million at the box office
52998 this is the best reviewed movie of the year and will contribute to value over time as one of our classic films
52999 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
53000 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
53001 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
53002 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
53003 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation

53005 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
53006 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
53007 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
53008 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
53009 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
53010 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
53011 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
53012 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
53013 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
53014 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
53015 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
53016 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
53017 something which has never occurred since time immemorial a young woman did not fart in her husbands lap

53028 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
53029 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
53030 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
53031 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
53032 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
53033 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
53034 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
53035 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
53036 absolutely were actually trying to crack that were trying to figure out some ideas for it but yes it would be a prequel
53037 in the prequel its slightly different because its earlier we were three years later so we did a lot of research into the way nature would have sort of overtaken the city with the cracks in the streets and the weeds
53038 the first time you got out there and shut down 6th avenue its like how are we going to do this day after day after day but by the end its just like you know how to do it you got the p a s who know how to shut it down how to let the traffic through in between set ups and you just sort of get the routine down so thats not the issue
53039 in every case homosexual practice is considered sinful something that breaks our relationship with god and harms our wellbeing
53040 it is something for which one should repent and seek forgiveness and healing which god is ever ready to do
53041 when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal
53042 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
53043 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well

53052 what people do in the civilian sector but solely with practice on military bases by active duty personnel
53053 the fact of the matter is and witches wont like this our country was founded on a basic belief in god
53054 and we have always been a country that recognizes that moral foundation as coming from god not from a tree not from a blade of grass not from the sun but from god if people want to go out on their own and worship trees or grass or the sun they can do that but i dont think its appropriate for our military to say we wont draw any lines or set any standards about what people can do with military sanction
53055 the proposed excavation of the relocated queen esther drive would likely impact the groundwater feeding the existing wetland between the proposed queen esther drive and road c this wetland impact will still be considered diminimus while the impact of the groundwater could impact the roads stability also the alignment of the road may have impacts to the groundwater flows to the hafer pond and spring outflow the alignment is also upstream of the other wetlands in the project area which will also have an effect on their groundwater it is difficult at this time to predict behaves in the area or how these impacts will be viewed by dep pennsylvania department of environmental protection or the army corp of engineers and how the mitigation will impact the construction costs

53058 lack of time prevented us from being able to address the outstanding concerns of one delegation
53059 no position has been taken by the security council on the question of whether to take any action in the light of the moreno ocampo proposal to indict president beshir
53060 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
53061 i want to give high marks to the british delegation

53093 the songs are lush and complex using a perfect harmony of keys acoustics and the occasional electric outburst to make songs that are sublimely endearing
53094 they have a true grasp of songwriting that is not often found in modern bands overall im surprised theyre not a household name by now

53098 the new frontiers might surprise you with music thats sincere and wise beyond its years
53099 it is every bit as good as the album version and has a few surprises for all you fans the song has more of a raw feel to it which we think captures what the new frontiers is all about
53100 the new frontiers from dallas texas are a subdued outfit who build their songs with patience and care no poses and brouhaha just letting the songs breathe with ease you might pigeonhole them as a shoegaze alt country pop band they are a true indie band independent and original if you would put wilco and whiskeytown into a blender add some ray davies smartness for the lyrics and you get an idea what they sound like
53101 the debut album by this texas quintet is a calm pleasure there is nothing extravagant in the simple piano and guitar led songs herein just understated but satisfying melodies wrapped up in a mature songcraft never resorting to melodrama or grandiosity the new frontiers have instead created an album that engages without gimmick or shtick just good songs
53102 the record is well paced and beautiful all with an attention to detail and maturity that is staggering for a debut effort a warm companion piece to chilly january nights
53103 if you like your indie rock more on the accessible side than the arty side than the new frontiers mending is one you should really pick up it stays grounded with a plethora of solid melody and stays on the edge of being epic without ever going overboard
53104 the bands mending is an affair that takes quiet truths and findings seriously and with every ounce of wonderment they can muster
53105 this is the best fucking album to come out so far this year

53114 everyones been saying you still had the presence of mind to jump on the football when you dropped it but i do remember as soon as i got hit i knew something was wrong
53115 they told me after i saw everything that in 80 per cent of the cases like this people would not be on their feet
53116 it was tearing her up in side because i hadnt had a chance to talk to her she just needed to hear my voice to know that everything was going to be ok
53117 all ive been thinking about is making sure i do what i need to do to get healthy for my family
53118 so i can go back and be the dad that ive been and the husband that ive been
53119 right now im just concentrating on getting better on getting healthy and getting back strong thats all thats on my mind right now

53139 if we hadnt made that spontaneous decision to buy christian have him in london take him to george get him successfully rehabilitated the george adamson trust would not really have existed
53140 and now there is a game park a national park as a direct result of christians life its a wonderful wonderful endorsement
53141 it is pretty extraordinary footage and quite humbling but it is sort of very beautiful the response
53142 i suppose 35 years later to find that people are so fascinated by it and have so enjoyed it is slightly overwhelming and all the comments on the youtube site theyre so positive it is marvelous that so many people are getting so much enjoyment out of it
53143 we were rather shocked when we saw this cub in harrods in a department store in a very small cage not only was he totally entrancing we must be able to do something better for him he cant stay in a cage this size
53144 we were working in a pine shop which was a very trendy furniture shop at the time in a very trendy part of london the end of the 60s the beginning of the 70s
53145 it was a very creative a very exciting time to be living in london it almost seemed natural to be living with a lion and to have him sitting in the back of a car going up and down the kings road
53146 there was such trust between today christians former owners had been told the lion wouldnt recognize them but the video shows the lions obvious joy at being reunited with the two men us and such love he ran toward us with such love and excitement in his eyes and we felt exactly the same way we were just so excited to see him looking so big and healthy the story had just turned out so beautifully when it could have had a very different ending
53147 when he first starts seeing us hes looking looking is it us is it us and then suddenly he says right this is them and down he comes and there wasnt a moment that we ever doubted that it was going to be a wonderful greeting we never doubted it
53148 he was with wild lionesses he had a litter of cubs and his genes had been passed on back into the wild after that time we saw him he was never seen again it was like a final farewell he was completely integrated back into the wild
53149 were just hoping that people who have enjoyed this clip its a phenomenal number if they would want to contact the george adamson trust through
53150 what were saying is exhaust other remedies mr president it is the economic life of americas families and to suggest that drilling offshore is going to make a difference to them paycheck to paycheck now is a frivolous contention

53154 i can say with confidence that neither the pakistan army nor any of the past governments of pakistan were ever involved or had any knowledge of a qs proliferation activities the show was completely and entirely a qs and he did it all for money
53155 contrary to some perception he is no fall guy for anyone there is absolutely no evidence to the contrary

53161 de c mo organizar la sociedad y qu derechos el usuario del software merece
53162 el software que no es libre es un software privativo que priva de libertad a sus usuarios y los mantiene en un estado de divisi n e impotencia
53163 el software de apple es igualmente injusto y muchas otras empresas tambi n crean este tipo de programas
53164 para mantener nuestra libertad debemos rechazarlos es la nica manera
53165 el software libre hace parte del conocimiento humano el software privativo es conocimiento secreto negado a la humanidad
53166 la libertad cero es la libertad de ejecutar el programa como quieras la libertad uno es la libertad de estudiar el c digo fuente y cambiarlo para que el programa haga lo que quieras como tienes la libertad de cambiar tu casa o tu carro
53167 es la libertad de ayudar a tu pr ximo esencial por razones ticas es la libertad de hacer y distribuir copias exactas del programa distribuirlas a los dem s es la ayuda entre la gente no se debe nunca prohibir
53168 es la libertad de contribuir a tu comunidad es decir la libertad de hacer y distribuir copias de tus versiones cambiadas del programa as tus cambios que quiz s haces por ti o haces por otros que te pagan pueden contribuir al mundo entero al conocimiento humano
53169 cuando nos oponemos a la globalizaci n es una abreviaci n porque la cosa a la cual nos oponemos es realmente a la globalizaci n del poder injusto de las empresas grandes
53170 las empresas no deben tener poder siempre es injusto y globalizarlo lo hace m s injusto pero la comunidad del software libre es una comunidad del desarrollo y uso del conocimiento til que globaliza este desarrollo y uso porque compartir el conocimiento es bueno globalizarlo lo es m s todav a

53173 empeora el caso el tener muchas gente que no ha aprendido a usar windows es un recurso del pa s y las misiones educativas van desperdiciando este recurso es mejor parar si no pueden hoy comenzar a ense ar el software libre es mejor esperar hasta que puedan hacerlo
53174 es muy bueno porque todos los estados tienen realmente la misi n de promover la libertad y el bienestar de los ciudadanos pero muchos ni lo intentan porque obedecen al imperio de las empresas pero en am rica latina hoy en d a hay algunos estados que s intentan
53175 los tratados de libre explotaci n son tratados para eliminar la industria y centralizarla en unos pocos pa ses dejando los dem s pa ses dependientes pero lo peor de estos tratados es que disminuyen el poder de los estados que pueden ser democr ticos a favor del poder de las empresas que ni siquiera pretenden ser democr ticas
53176 no hay que pensar que es una dependencia a usa porque nosotros los estadounidenses tambi n somos dependientes somos v ctimas del poder de las empresas y nuestro gobierno no funciona por nosotros sino por las empresas para mantener su poder sobre nosotros
53177 es mi misi n en cada pa s promover la libertad en el campo inform tico de la vida y cuando puedo promuevo la libertad en otros campos de la vida pero mi campo es la inform tica

53192 we offered a civil version of a duel in the form of 10 town hall meetings senator obama has yet to take us up on that offer we would be shocked but thrilled if we got a phone call at our campaign headquarters today to discuss our civil proposal

53198 weve built in a number of ethical choices in the game and in each case doing the sleazy thing will come back to bite you you can try to manipulate the press for example only show them the undamaged part of your plant but the truth will come out
53199 there were people who knew things were going wrong but they didnt have the skills to bring those issues to light
53200 lately i dont think of you at all im living alone i dont need you anymore

53203 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
53204 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
53205 were not in the habit of reacting every time they put out a statement
53206 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
53207 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
53208 this is a potentially risky comment to make for a campaign already under increasing criticism for some of the claims its made over the past week
53209 talk about the race card and injection of it into the debate can result in a negative backlash you can ask the clinton campaign about that
53210 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
53211 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
53212 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
53213 thats a definition of madness but thats what john mccain is offering hes offering bush economic policies and karl rove politics
53214 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid
53215 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
53216 these anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day
53217 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing my opponent john mccain thinks were on the right track
53218 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants

53263 konstantin seperti bapanya menyembah matahari yang tidak tertaklukkan pertobatannya hendaknya tidak ditafsirkan sebagai pengalaman kerelaan yang datang dari batin ini adalah masalah militer pengertiannya mengenai doktrin kristen tidak pernah jelas sekali tetapi ia yakin bahwa kemenangan dalam pertempuran bergantung pada karunia dari allah orang orang kristen
53264 konstantin sendiri menjadi ketua dengan aktif memimpin pertemuan dan secara pribadi mengusulkan rumusan penting yang menyatakan hubungan kristus dengan allah dalam kredo yang dikeluarkan oleh konsili tersebut dari satu zat dengan bapa karena sangat segan terhadap kaisar para uskup kecuali dua orang saja menandatangani kredo itu kebanyakan dari mereka dengan sangat berat hati
53265 konstantin pada dasarnya tidak mengerti apa apa tentang pertanyaan pertanyaan yang diajukan dalam teologi yunani
53266 perkembangan penuh dari ajaran tritunggal terjadi di barat pada pengajaran dari abad pertengahan ketika suatu penjelasan dari segi filsafat dan psikologi disetujui
53267 kami menyembah satu allah dalam tritunggal sang bapa adalah allah sang anak adalah allah dan roh kudus adalah allah namun mereka bukan tiga allah tetapi satu allah
53268 kredo itu baru dikenal oleh gereja timur pada abad ke 12 sejak abad ke 17 para sarjana pada umumnya setuju bahwa kredo athanasia tidak ditulis oleh athanasius meninggal tahun 373 tetapi mungkin disusun di perancis selatan pada abad ke 5 pengaruh kredo itu tampaknya terutama ada di perancis selatan dan spanyol pada abad ke 6 dan ke 7 ini digunakan dalam liturgi gereja di jerman pada abad ke 9 dan kira kira tidak lama setelah itu di roma
53269 definisi ortodoks yang terakhir dari tritunggal sebagian besar adalah masalah politik gereja
53270 sebelum hari itu haruslah datang dahulu murtad dan haruslah dinyatakan dahulu manusia durhaka
53271 sesudah aku pergi serigala serigala yang ganas akan masuk ke tengah tengah kamu dan tidak akan menyayangkan kawanan itu bahkan dari antara kamu sendiri akan muncul beberapa orang yang dengan ajaran palsu mereka berusaha menarik murid murid dari jalan yang benar dan supaya mengikut mereka
53272 akan datang waktunya orang tidak dapat lagi menerima ajaran sehat tetapi mereka akan mengumpulkan guru guru menurut kehendaknya untuk memuaskan keinginan telinganya mereka akan memalingkan telinganya dari kebenaran dan membukanya bagi dongeng
53273 ajaran tritunggal dari abad ke 4 tidak dengan saksama mencerminkan ajaran kristen yang mula mula mengenai sifat allah

53279 i dont want them to think that because theyre home its not important its important and
53280 in every case homosexual practice is considered sinful something that breaks our relationship with god and harms our wellbeing
53281 it is something for which one should repent and seek forgiveness and healing which god is ever ready to do
53282 when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal
53283 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
53284 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
53285 there is also a crisis with respect to food prices which have gone up dramatically
53286 there is an urgent need for full support for the people of afghanistan particularly in remote rural areas and this increasing insecurity is threatening the ability of aid agencies to reach out to those areas
53287 i would say it took us a few days to get our sea legs
53288 we had many different voices here but once we congealed around big oil and alternatives bam the message is out the momentum is now on our side it changed here in a week
53289 democrats lack of ideas on how to solve rising gas prices is deafening in our races and our candidates solutions are resonating
53290 that is driving the democrats crazy right now so this knee jerk response is not a surprise at all
53291 it could be in a bigger picture of things as all these things come together
53292 but im not going to have this big path that were going down sidetracked by a political ploy of the republicans
53293 its interesting to me that its taken so long for democrats to figure out how to come back on this without giving in on offshore drilling

53304 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
53305 ma ma wheres my pa time of the two americas

53307 it was always my dream to go to the u s and study opera and many here have helped my dreams come true
53308 when it was over we all ran outside and the earth kept shaking with thousands and thousands of aftershocks we were very scared that another big one would come
53309 this earthquake was a very sad thing we realized that life is not so easy
53310 it changed how many people are they are more kind and dont fight as much they now realize money and power arent so important
53311 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
53312 thats a good question the answer is nobody really knows
53313 theres not good data showing that eight eight ounce glasses does any good to anybody
53314 our body is mostly water we need to replenish that water
53315 water in its purest form theres no data that thats exactly what you need from a medical standpoint though i do recommend water
53316 your bodys pretty good at telling you when it needs extra water and when it doesnt listen to your thirst
53317 mainly just because theyre losing extra water in their sweat and the heat they generate with their muscles causes evaporation of water they need to replenish that as soon as they can
53318 theres an osmoreceptor in your brain that lets you know when theres a slight increase of chemicals that means theres less water more chemicals which triggers the thirst mechanism that causes you to seek drink
53319 anytime theres a hard and set rule you have to question whether youre being told the right thing
53320 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
53321 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
53322 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
53323 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
53324 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
53325 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
53326 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
53327 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
53328 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
53329 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
53330 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
53331 we received far fewer bodies due to the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
53332 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
53333 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof

53335 artificial intelligence no thank you computer i can handle the job by myself pretty well
53336 the tax rebate hike will give a break to the ailing clothing exporters and help ease the concern over an unemployment spurt
53337 but it could be a temporary measure as the government will continue to push forward the upgrade of its industries
53338 the range of the products benefited from the rebate increase is much smaller than those suffered from the rebate cuts a year ago
53339 its a clear signal that the government has no intention of encouraging an industry that keeps causing trade tensions in the long run
53340 outside of construction employment growth has moderated from the previous quarter
53341 anecdotally i hear that fresh grads may find it hard to get jobs in the financial sector
53342 we must continue to link built in wage increases to productivity gains and help our people through various non wage measures
53343 are you suggesting that we all would be better off if the government let fannie and freddie go bk
53344 absolutely the government fronting the money and then collecting no interest
53345 large bees for many years when i thought of the community foundation of middle tennessee i thought of the foundations unique symbol of philanthropy however most times i honestly wish i only associated the community foundation with large bees and not with the loss of a dear friend on sunday june 24 2007 i lost my lifelong friend chad welch when his more than two year battle with acute mylogenous leukemia came to an end tragic it is the only way to describe chads untimely passing at the age of 28 he had his whole life in front of him but a doctors visit on a monday morning in 2005 would drastically alter chads day to day life for the next 26 months despite this dramatic shift in his life chad did not lose his passion for living and his desire to be a force of positive change
53346 with my twenty years of extensive research in disease pathology i have discovered there are five conditions that cause poor health the first three only account for approximately 5 of all the health problems that plague america they are 1 hereditary weakness of genes genetic predispositions 2 congenital deformity 3 permanent organ injury the other two or remaining 95 that are the direct cause of all of mankinds disease and suffering arises from cellular toxicities and nutritional deficiencies over which the principles of a healthy diet and lifestyle play a tremendous part these two conditions never occur separately they always occur together in combination
53347 a fresh report from the prestigious commonwealth fund concludes that despite spending more on healthcare than any other industrialized nation the us overall continues to fall far short on key indicators of health outcomes and quality the report found that even with lavish spending the united states ranked last among 19 industrialized nations when it comes to premature deaths that could potentially have been prevented by timely access to effective healthcare given the commonwealth fund reputation for gold standard reports sic this work is taken seriously throughout the healthcare world
53348 private insurance in the united states suffers from a legitimacy problem its hard to trust that the hmo is working in your best interests when they exist to make money and they make money by rejecting your care not every american has an economics degree but were not idiots incentives matter meanwhile for all the talk you hear of the awful rationing worldwide theres no developed country where the citizens are even close to as unhappy with their healthcare as we are which is why ideas like tom daschles proposal for a healthcare federal reserve have a certain political logic to them

53369 with our service we can validate the different network paths that the application is committed to and proactively identify and communicate potential issues
53370 companies need to take a holistic view of virtualisation that also includes the network infrastructure
53371 infrastructure monitoring needs to be built into their virtualisation strategy and architecture to enable customers to scale virtualisation effectively at the edge of the network
53372 we are revisiting the pricing as part of the refresh of the service

53406 going to school in the fall im looking for the ideal alarm clock to beat the late nights and what not and noticed a few digital photo frames alarm clocks i want a decent that has battery backup and good resolution on the screen for viewing photos an auxiliary audio jack would be a major plus which one do you guys recommend that falls under the 200 dollar mark thanks a million
53407 y amargo porque lo que he visto francamente no ha terminado de encantarme dura situaci n pasan
53408 if i can sit around and continue to drink beer and do whatever i want to do without any exercise it just sounds like a good idea to me
53409 just to take a pill and get the results i dont know its too easy
53410 it would make me a little nervous to take something that took all the hard work out of it
53411 exercise has other benefits you release endorphines which dialates your artery walls helps keep the plaque away helps lower the blood pressure and helps reduce depression so i dont know that a pill that increases your metabolic rate can do all those wonderful things
53412 this is hard i want chocolate or fries or animal crackers or any other simple carb you can imagine feed me
53413 how will i feel five minutes after i eat this
53414 occasionally the cost of a market failure will be less than the cost of government intervention with all of its political economy and other risks and costs
53415 but even in these cases regulatory or fiscal intervention by government may be required to ensure an optimal response
53416 more than 99 per cent of all firms in australia will not need to be directly involved
53417 the honour of the appointment carries with it great responsibility which i willingly accept
53418 french has progressive views but he is a legal traditionalist in terms of how he goes about deciding cases
53419 i doubt he is going to be a really progressive creative judge because he would see quite strict limits on what a high court judge should do and that would be different to other people who might have been appointed
53420 but i dont think spigelman would have fitted into that category either
53421 he is not in the lionel murphy mould or even in the michael kirby mould neither of them are
53422 is quite distinctive from the views of most of the gleeson court
53423 what you see from french is an understanding that the constitution is fundamentally about federal co operation
53424 he will bring with him to the high court a wealth of ability and experience and the goodwill of the entire australian judiciary
53425 what happened today is far from ideal and if the device was actually a real bomb the way it was handled would have been a disaster
53426 i was always active in sports such as running cross country in high school and swimming on the swim team in college
53427 i remember specifically in 1995 my waist size went from a 34 inches to a 38 in a matter of months
53428 i got a size 36 pants to accommodate my waist size and i had to ask for a bigger size for christmas because they were too tight
53429 that was pretty depressing to see that 262 pounds on the physical just knowing that i had become that heavy
53430 i kept expressing a really persistent fear i had of restricting my comfort foods i felt to truly lose weight i couldnt ever eat the things i loved hamburgers ice cream chocolate bacon cheese and cookies
53431 i felt like in order to lose weight i would have to give up those things
53432 i had a double cheeseburger onion rings and milkshake at johnny rockets right before the meeting
53433 i weighed 252 6 at my first weight watchers meeting
53434 when i got to 200 pounds i decided well why dont i go for a weight thats a healthy weight range for my height
53435 so i did and by that point the weight had slowed down it doesnt come off as quickly as you get closer to your goal weight but it was still coming off
53436 i literally had people that knew me that didnt recognize me
53437 be the best friend you can to yourself while youre going through this weight loss journey ive always been someone who was very hard on themselves and suffered from low self esteem
53438 the hardest part of joining weight watchers was walking into my first meeting i knew that there is no magic device and i was embarking on a plan that would take total dedication
53439 its a nice day out dont stay in front of the tv go out and play go ride your bike
53440 this seemed like a too good to be true treat i got my own ice cream cup and a nice size one at that not some wimpy diet ice cream on a stick i really enjoyed the texture and the taste and i am not one who likes light ice cream so this is big compliment
53441 the milk chocolate had a luxurious mouth feel rich flavor and just the right dose of virtuosity heres to healthy chocolate
53442 the dark chocolate was silky smooth it contained a whopping 60 cacao which means its good for your health not to mention your sweet tooth truly a guilt free indulgence
53443 the dulce de leche is so yummy the chocolate mint and mocha are also good but this is my fave sort of like butterscotch only better
53444 i like to put mine in the freezer for a couple hours kind of gives it that ice cream effect very yummy
53445 hostess 100 calorie packs are so cute you wont want to eat them these little cakes pack a sweet punch plus its nice to be able to eat three of anything
53446 these were delicious sweet but not cloying the cake was very tender and moist and the icing was soft
53447 i liked the apples and cream flavor and wished id had some vanilla wafers to crumble on top
53448 this little treat is near the puddings and is to die for its kind of like an apple pie with sugar free custard on top its listed as a dietary exchange for dairy and fiber but is tasty too
53449 well this is going to be a long flight for you now isnt it
53450 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
53451 por qu deber a dar miedo un sombrero disgustado por la falta de imaginaci n de los adultos el principito decide cambiar de oficio
53452 based on the response to this mornings email we are very close to making another buy we still need just a little bit more if you were not able to respond this morning please consider doing so now
53453 i am often asked if i would support my opponent if he should win the primary the answer i always give is that i dont want jay nixon to be governor i know that on this we agree but i also know that the best way to keep jay nixon out of the governors mansion is for me to be his opponent come november he cant attack me for bad votes in washington he cant tie me to poor congressional approval ratings he cant say i am out of touch with missourians it will be hard for him to attack me at all
53454 guess id rather talk to you about bugs than nothing with nobody

53466 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity
53467 it was better than i expected the organisation was great and the music and atmosphere were fantastic
53468 with all the evidence that is now before them i dont see any reason why the authorities should continue with these investigations of alleged sodomy
53469 in any other system where there is justice and fairness the powers would have by now shut down the investigations and cleared my name
53470 i pray everything returns to normal soon so we can continue to live a peaceful life
53471 will come out with a comprehensive statement on future bilateral engagement
53472 its really sad the two sides have started fighting again its triggered all kinds of fears
53473 earlier wed duck into underground bunkers but the quake damaged the bunkers and we didnt build new ones because we had the ceasefire
53474 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
53475 he told the police he had nothing to do with this
53476 we started the year strong but the second quarter showed a dramatic downturn
53477 with reduced consumer spending businesses have cut back on advertising
53478 i want to apologise for the past incident with the umbrella i was preparing a character for a possible movie role where the husband doesnt play his part so they swap places
53479 unfortunately i didnt get the part im sorry i got all carried away with my part
53480 he has the highest upside an industry source said last night
53481 the sky could be the limit for this kid said danny darwin the former pirate whos great lakes pitching coach
53482 this kid is definitely a big league prospect darwin said
53483 his changeup is kind of erratic right now but at times its a good changeup darwin said
53484 and he has a plus two seamer fastball hes definitely going to get some attention from the pirates when he gets over there
53485 when you look at it from a legacy standpoint its comforting to know we have sharp young drivers coming along
53486 we have young fans and theyll be able to relate to the young drivers
53487 its neat racing against a guy like steve david because i grew up watching him and cheering for him
53488 he would stop what he was doing and make time for kids
53489 i think the older drivers are ok with younger drivers as long as they show they can handle themselves
53490 this has been an all time dream i never thought id be able to do it
53491 its like playing basketball with michael jordan i get to race boats with steve david
53492 the sun is a dangerously bright object and must never be viewed directly unless you have special eclipse glasses welders goggles or a professional solar filter
53493 sunglasses are not safe and never use home made filters such as cds photographic negatives or coloured film
53494 god new york would rather burn their city down than put a disabled model on the catwalk i reckon
53495 its too early to say whether it has achieved what it set out to do
53496 it was probably seen as more of a reality programme than i would have hoped but its better than the subject not being broached at all
53497 i wanted somebody who was completely obviously disabled and capable of taking the industry by the scruff of the neck
53498 i hope kelly knox does that ive got an inkling she cant i hope she proves me wrong
53499 its good that the programme happened that somebody has been brave enough to do it enough people seem to be talking about it
53500 im not into modelling and i thought the show could be awful like another reality tv show but then i realised it was trying to do something to change peoples perceptions
53501 its been a tiny little step but hopefully one that may make an impact
53502 i think they made the right decision she is a lot more photogenic than i am and at the end of the day they are looking for a model
53503 i thought she didnt really care about it all that much because of things she told me but i think she may have changed her opinions
53504 i think thats unfair of course i care i wouldnt have done the programme in the first place if i didnt
53505 because i was born this way having one arm is normal to me its only since this show that i have been labelled disabled and thats been quite weird for me
53506 but even if i can make even a small difference that will be incredible im willing to put myself out there and be that role model
53507 we are supportive of anything that challenges negative stereotypes and that will result in a more equal playing field
53508 the programme highlighted the lack of equality and lack of opportunities for any woman who doesnt conform to the very narrow stereotypes of beauty
53509 we must be willing to get rid of the life weve planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us
53510 of itself mg production at longbridge is not going to be sizeable
53511 we are not talking about many cars we are talking about a screwdriver operation with parts coming in from china
53512 but symbolically it is hugely important it indicates a commitment to the site and we are likely to see sizeable production in two years time of a medium size car and research and development coming back so great news
53513 this is part of a long term commitment inside of 18 months we hope to have a brand new mg model designed in the uk and built at longbridge
53514 we should have further announcements about research and development and network dealerships as the uk part of the business expands
53515 we must be willing to get rid of the life weve planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us
53516 id like to address a few of your ps3 doubts and beliefs
53517 oh no my son daughter has heard of the existence of non straight people
53518 oh noes my kiddo is gonna catch the gay from the interwebs in da online games
53519 betcha 10k that the new community rep is a dyke
53520 dark necrid most of the forums have been okay a lot of that stuff above was from individual guild forums alliance forums and user blogs i think if that shit had gone down on the larger fansite forums it would have got shut down much like the guildwiki discussion speculating about my sexuality got shut down
53521 if they didnt like the game theyd get angry and quit sometimes its the people who get angry the most that really love the game
53522 doesnt seem to be an issue for most people now
53523 i did know that people would do google searches on me i knew they would find articles id written interviews id participted in and so on my blog is public and its not hard to link my handle to my real name however just because i expected some of these responses doesnt mean that sexism homophobia racism or all the rest of that shit are remotely acceptable
53524 you dont play dungeons amp dragons all those years and not learn something about courage
53525 like its name iretsus music is complex and hard to define
53526 making quirky structurally complex avant pop in the style of menomena or a less ornate broken social scene local three piece iretsu manages something quite special persuaded me to hit repeat after a week spent listening to way too many bands with so many songs gradually building toward epic heights its refreshing to hear someone actually scale back and let a song breathe for once chamber pop can often be pretty heavy stuff something that you cant really digest on one listen but iretsu has made something immensely listenable it takes a bit of time to adjust to its world but once you do you might never look back
53527 over the last couple months ive received many phone calls from riders on other teams who wanted to race next year for team astana though flattering it was my desire to first resign the key members who have contributed to the success of this new team im confident that the group we have assembled thus far will not only continue to win races but also represent astana kazakhstan and our entire sponsor family with pride and honor
53528 im very happy to have the opportunity to continue my career with team astana and johan when i see the number of riders who have resigned for next year it proves that we remain committed to this program regardless of which races we are invited to participate in we still have goals to achieve in 2008 but im already looking forward to next year
53529 im excited about what weve accomplished so far and believe that team astana has an even brighter future ahead i owe a great deal of gratitude to the kazakh officials who support this program and have always believed in the team its been a great partnership
53530 the kids are ready to get in pads theyre ready to hit somebody
53531 it was a long day because we had head winds almost all the way through but it suited us fine in a way because it wore out the peloton as it was also a long stage we tried to split the peloton towards the end but even though the wind was strong it was not quite enough to give us an edge out there in stead jason mccartney and michael blaudzun tried to make some breaks
53532 the peloton was stretched out at the end and as the finishing stretch was up hill as well it was perfect for matti he positioned himself with routine and performed great in the sprint
53533 i have really good form and its getting better all the time
53534 i havent been training too hard just doing local races and waiting for the team to do some big races
53535 i flipped over the handlebars and was also hit by a few riders from behind while i was lying on the ground
53536 it was certainly the worst crash i have ever been involved in
53537 im learning to exercise a lot of patience which has always been a tough thing for me
53538 i know that everything happens for a reason and im just going to try to make the most out of this situation
53539 you dont play dungeons amp dragons all those years and not learn something about courage
53540 going to school in the fall im looking for the ideal alarm clock to beat the late nights and what not and noticed a few digital photo frames alarm clocks i want a decent that has battery backup and good resolution on the screen for viewing photos an auxiliary audio jack would be a major plus which one do you guys recommend that falls under the 200 dollar mark thanks a million
53541 most businesses are started because you have a great idea and you take it out to the public to see if they like it
53542 this is the opposite were finding out what people want and doing it
53543 its the community whats rewarding is coming together to create a place in the city thats beneficial to the community and yourself and your friends
53544 its not crazy to do if you have an established loyal customer base
53545 we only need a few motivated people to lead and the ease of organization can make it happen
53546 suggests that toilet humor was as popular with the ancients as it is today
53547 113 years in o fair enough after all i think
53548 this is without a doubt the most significant policy change in the federal government in at least 25 years
53549 i s that the best you can come up with is that really what this election is about brad miskell
53550 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
53551 thats why everybodys tripping why did he hit the security guard like that
53552 if he doesnt remember you hell look at you weird
53553 it takes him a while for him to remember you
53554 the rangers are a great hitting team but going into the game i just tried to keep them guessing
53555 he kept the guys off balance and did a great job
53556 to the extent that we eliminate risk from life we may also succeed in sucking the air out of it a ship in the harbor is safe but that is not what ships are built for to bring ourselves to life requires courage
53557 who wouldve thought that this time last year id be the worlds most successful gospel singer
53558 yep im gonna buy that mansion in phoenix like we were talking about
53559 jokes on you the last way to try to pick up this girl is by claiming to be a gospel singer
53560 there was a bloodcurdling scream i was just reading my book and all of a sudden i heard it
53561 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say
53562 i dont think it will leave me for a while
53563 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
53564 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
53565 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
53566 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
53567 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
53568 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
53569 we will do whatever is required to help them and that includes counseling
53570 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
53571 he who lives by the sword will die by the sword
53572 you have heard it said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy but i say love your enemy bless them that curse you
53573 certainly the memory of sherry my wife the mother of my two children will always be with me forever
53574 its more of i would say a memorial its a remembrance its not a happy time
53575 maybe shes a jane doe out there in a hospital that maybe still isnt identified maybe shes unconscious maybe shes in an air pocket someplace
53576 i told you a year ago we have never second guessed sherrys decision
53577 it didnt have to happen i think it was made by man it shouldve been maintained by man
53578 but i dont really know how to say how do you say good bye to your mom
53579 i said i love you and she said i love you back
53580 yes i did we always say we love you before we went to bed each night and that was the way we lived
53581 someone asked me a year ago to describe sherry i said she lives within these two girls
53582 when he left me at college like this is it like two parents usually drop off their kids but i only had one i thought that was very hard
53583 but there are times personally for myself i had days where i just couldnt go on or didnt physically didnt know what to do i called the minister and he helped me through that
53584 sherry would want us to go forward that was her life her legacy that we have to continue on i think the biggest example of that is my two daughters last semester they both made the deans list shed be very proud of that
53585 shes in a good place today we know that and shes with our heavenly father and were grateful for that and someday well see her again
53586 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
53587 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
53588 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
53589 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
53590 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
53591 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
53592 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats
53593 i just want to make sure you are going to stick around
53594 we have had so many managers over the last couple of years
53595 dan gw ngopi yg punya lo dulu yah masi belom ngerti nih hehe

53613 ya klo om mengeluh jangan ama saya tapi ama boss om gimana sih
53614 i was shocked to see what it looked like myself
53615 obviously you hate to jump to tommy john right off the bat
53616 but i think its to the point where its kind of foolish to try to rehab for five months and try to let it heal that way i think the damage is beyond trying to heal itself
53617 if he has surgery im going to obviously do all i can to try to come back next year and help this team win
53618 you know what those things will take care of themselves
53619 i want to come back and be strong next year and whatever happens happens
53620 the surgeries today are pretty good as far as coming back at 100 percent
53621 im not really concerned with if i have it am i going to be 100 percent after the surgery
53622 its hard to sit here and not play when you feel fine
53623 but at the same time if i go back behind home plate and catch a foul tip in the mask and im not completely healed its going to make my concussion a lot worse
53624 i just need time to rest just make sure be overly cautious i think monday will be a week i think thats what youre trying to shoot for
53625 hes gone through heck this year didnt he win 11 games two years in a row
53626 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
53627 se or tu palabra llega hoy hasta mi vida te lo agradezco y pido que te hagas presente para guiar mis pensamientos mis afectos e intenciones para as poder encontrar tu voluntad

53631 yo no se si fue la mejor coreograf a que hemos vistos pero fue excelente y de una gran carga er tica

53634 the adverse outcomes of assisted fertilization that we noted compared with those in the general population could therefore be attributable to the factors leading to infertility rather than to factors related to the reproductive technology
53635 considering that 1 to 4 percent of all newborns in europe are conceived after assisted reproductive technology art safety concerns are important reducing the number of multiple births has made improvements but we need to gain a better biological understanding of the reasons why infertility and ovarian stimulation may have adverse effects on infant health consequently we have to continuously monitor the short and long term risks of art
53636 the ioc would like to stress that no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into
53637 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
53638 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc i only know the ground rules on censorship have changed
53639 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
53640 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
53641 a partir de la publicaci n de la obra por internet comienzan a comunicarse conmigo directores de teatro de diversos pa ses para que los autorizara a representarla es as que el pa s de los sin ceros se puso en escena en argentina ecuador espa a el salvador estados unidos chile colombia m xico puerto rico y venezuela y pr ximamente la estrenar n en uruguay y en la ciudad de pergamino
53642 el pa s de los sin ceros en clases de teatro lengua y matem tica haciendo de esta una obra sumamente conocida entre los ni os y adolescentes en edad escolar
53643 la trama puede pertenecer a cualquier lugar no es una obra que hable de un problema espec ficamente argentino en muchas escuelas es utilizada para trabajar el tema de la discriminaci n
53644 a mi me satisface por lo menos que me manden un email pidi ndome permiso para llevarla a escena me parece muy importante esto de no dejar al autor afuera de su obra
53645 supongo que ah tendr mayor trascendencia pero ya super mis expectativas porque no me esperaba todo esto de una obra que escrib dirig y actu
53646 forgive me gentlemen if i dont understand what in the name of mordor your malfunction happens to be
53647 you did put up a mighty fight worthy of umbar castamir would be proud for he could shatter law with law like a sledgehammer
53648 if we get to the ruined city many will die those soldiers are not the farmer militias most in the city have fought ive faced the crescent marked ones before and they fight to the death and do it fiercely
53649 there will always be another rat now onward things to do people to damage

53665 essentially it will be the latest in a series of industry renationalisations and a reversal of what till now has been one of russias privatisation success stories
53666 i believe the shares of the state company will be managed jointly with private owners or they will be bought on market based conditions
53667 would be bad for the entire development of the market
53668 mary lou sapone infiltrated the executive boards and learned the plans of organizations trying to decrease deaths by gun in this country and apparently reported it back to organizations like the nra which are trying to increase deaths by gun in this country
53669 youve got around 30 000 gun deaths in this country per year another 75 000 non fatal gun wounds half the suicides are by gun and this clown and his four colleagues decided that the 32 year old ban on handguns in washington d c and the demand that firearms kept in the home be locked or disassembled was unconstitutional based on the second amendment
53670 despite years of fog created by the nra and right wing organizations that isnt very complicated for the purposes of forming a state militia youre entitled to keep and bear arms obviously those would have to be the kind of arms in use in 1791 when the bill of rights was passed the musket the wheel lock the flint lock the 13th century chinese hand cannon stuff like that scalia of course simply decided that the militia part of the second amendment is some sort of quaint anachronism that he could happily ignore and theres the beautiful thing about our country they say anybody can grow up to be a supreme court justice and in antonin scalia theres your proof and tonights worst person in the world
53671 and the demand that firearms kept in the home be locked or disassembled was unconstitutional based on the second amendment
53672 you know its an election year when certain people start grabbing headlines by attacking the faith of presidential candidates with all these stones being cast at barack obama it can be hard to know what to believe
53673 i think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the role of faith in peoples lives
53674 i tell you the truth as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me
53675 what im excited about at this stage of the game it seems like the evangelical community is waking up to the deeper and broader approach
53676 we knew that this 2 100 year old ancient greek mechanism calculated complex cycles of mathematical astronomy it really surprised us to discover that it also showed the four year cycle of ancient greek games
53677 the antikythera mechanism is of crucial importance for the history of science and technology
53678 it tells us of a revolution in human thought in ancient greece the earliest known example of a machine for making calculations of a machine for predicting the future

53688 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
53689 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
53690 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
53691 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
53692 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
53693 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
53694 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
53695 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
53696 all of the items on the menu can be traced back to its raw materials
53697 from where its from at the farm to when its presented on the table well have safe and complete information and are fully convinced they are safe to consume
53698 before the competition starts i think for all the foreign athletes they will exercise voluntary control of their food consumption
53699 they will not consume those foods they are not familiar with that is because theyre not sure whether theyre allergic to the food or whether the foods will lead to any other unexpected problems therefore we do not need to exercise any control on their food consumption they will do it by themselves
53700 we will have a sample of each item on the menu and keep the sample for at least 48 hours should the athletes fall ill because of the food consumption we will run a testing

53706 as china works to clear the air in beijing it must also use its time in the spotlight to push for an end to violence in darfur and central africa

53708 there were numerous irregularities concerning my relation to this institution and my appearance here
53709 my commitment was to withdraw even from literary life and all sorts of public life

53720 it was interesting to see all of the colleges who showed up i was just a bit let down that no trade schools came out
53721 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
53722 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
53723 sam qualified this moments later when he realised he had been taken out of context
53724 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment
53725 i think it was a slip i understood what he said i didnt take the double meaning in it i understand why people might
53726 i know james brayshaw did and he took it up with sam
53727 im starting to really in some ways sort of question if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair
53728 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think youve got to take him on face value
53729 that resulted in the ship swinging to starboard on exiting the port and running aground at beacon 44

53735 it did its best to keep above 94 us cents but it looks like it just gave way to selling pressure this morning
53736 the real danger for the rba as far as they are concerned is that they dont want to step in too quickly and start cutting rates when there is still inflationary pressures to some extent in the market
53737 they want to be very much certain that a rate cut is warranted
53738 i feel that the current leadership in the guam fire department is adversely affecting the morale and welfare of its personnel

53751 it was an extremely difficult decision you know you never want to abandon patients
53752 i find that to be very distressing these patients are not physically or emotionally well enough to travel out of province its a huge life disruption for them it would be very stressful theyve suffered enough
53753 it just doesnt make sense i think its important that we do everything we can to keep them in this province
53754 the findings of this assessment suggest the need for immediate action to buttress efforts to protect health from current climate hazards
53755 but have not been as successful adapting to extreme heat
53756 climate change could tip the ecological balance and trigger outbreaks of disease previously rare or unknown in canada
53757 this report makes it clear that if you have bad health outcomes now youre likely to be more impacted by extreme weather events than if youre at the top of the health ladder
53758 what was really exciting from a public health perspective is that the rates of heart attack decreased so significantly in the non smokers
53759 second hand smoke has very high levels of toxic gases and small particles

53778 we immediately informed sayajigunj police and police control room which arrived with dog squad and metal detectors to check all nine floors of the building
53779 in these explosions the improvised explosive devices ieds used were different and so were the explosions at the hospitals at the civil hospital the strongest explosions took place resulting in the largest casualties
53780 these factors have raised several questions which include procurement of technology for the blasts from outside the country these are testing times as this iraq and gulf link is unprecedented
53781 this is a tie up between terrorist outfits like huji let and al qaida it is natural that such trends will emerge the terror links within the country run through states like maharashtra and uttar pradesh
53782 that apart up has been a hub of subversive activities since long the blasts that took place in up like the serial bombings in varanasi are proof enough
53783 some suspects who have been put under scanner stay in small ghettos at uttar pradesh the terrorists have a stronghold in various parts of up where they can get the material they desire the five kg gas cylinders found at the explosion sites also point towards up we have to rely on such circumstantial evidence and check out each of them to know who these terror operatives are
53784 we are going to make a special appeal to the court that the hearing should be held as soon as possible considering the present situation
53785 it feels like death is staring us in the face the emptying ward is disturbing we hope for the best
53786 huji said to be behind the blasts is a bangladeshbased organization
53787 people had a habit of looking at me as if i were some kind of mirror instead of a person they didnt see me they saw their own lewd thoughts then they white masked themselves by calling me the lewd one
53788 i knew i belonged to the public and to the world not because i was talented or even beautiful but because i had never belonged to anything or anyone else
53789 everybody is always tugging at you theyd all like a sort of chunk out of you i don think they realize it but its like grrr do this grr do that but you do want to stay intact intact and on two feet
53790 hes bowled very well his lines been excellent and hes got more pace out of the wicket than anybody else
53791 its a bit easier for bowlers going on and off but not that easy for anyone and he did pretty well with that new ball burst
53792 the wicket at the oval will obviously have a lot more bounce than this one if he gets a wicket with bounce in it then im sure hed be a handful
53793 england havent done themselves any favours in selection they have selected themselves into a bit of a hole
53794 the result has been inconsistency even in the new zealand series just from a cricketing point of view i dont think england played particularly well
53795 batters were struggling against a new zealand side which is still growing
53796 the balance of the side is what they are finding quite difficult to get right but harmison should definitely be in the 12
53797 on a bouncy wicket like that youd think youd want another bowler who can get the ball up and through like andrew flintoff and try to take them on a little bit
53798 if the disk starts having problems youll have problems accessing whats on it
53799 the commissions chief executive peter wardle has written to the parties saying it has strong reservations about proposals

53822 the increased stress caused as result of tailgating can lead to volatile situations on the road and tailgating is responsible for approximately 7 per cent of road traffic accidents in the uk by driving less erratically with fewer gear changes rapid accelerations and decelerations the average journey time is 8 per cent faster overall so improving driving habits could actually save time and money as well as lives
53823 the car was brand new for the first pocono race and its been waiting to go back as fast as it was in june during qualifying and the race i think it should be strong a car that can run in the top 10 if we make the right adjustments i dont see why we cant have a shot at another win as good as it was the first race if we do the right things we should have another shot
53824 weve missed it a couple times in the last month as far as the finish but weve had good points in all those races
53825 the next six races are tracks that ive run well at in the past and look forward to going back to them again if things go smooth and we dont have the wrecks and things that can happen in the sport we should have a shot at making the chase
53826 for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels
53827 right now were still in the beginning phases of camp so we havent quite gotten to those dog days yet coach gruden has done a good job taking care of us so right now for the most part i think everybody is still feeling pretty good
53828 really i wont get the ball as much as i would ever want to im pretty sure of that but youve got guys like warrick dunn earnest graham michael bennett ken darby i mean theyre looking fantastic i just kind of take it as an honor to block for those guys and work together as a team to win a championship
53829 i just like to see a linebacker one on one in the hole i know the guys behind me are going to do what they have to do and i just want them to know they can count on me to handle my side of the job its really just one of those things i kind of tease them sometimes oh man i would have broken that tackle come on man in the huddle even i mean we talk
53830 its pretty much one of those things where it will be completely up to the coach it may be game plan based whoever he wants to run the ball is going to carry the load really when you have more than one guy who is handling you dont get all of those injuries you lose your one main star and you are pretty much starting over but to have so many guys who can do it and do it at a level that they have proven that they can do it is a plus for the entire team
53831 first i have to talk about jeffs toughness youve seen him last year hes head first hes trying to scramble hes doing everything he can to get the first down to make the big play you cant ask anything more from jeff
53832 i havent seen much of carl stewart but byron storer is looking very stellar in the hole very strong im just trying to help him out with a few things as far as putting the finishing touch on a block i think byron is ready to play
53833 no i dont really see a difference the only difference that i see is that in the afternoon we go into our dome and we have our walk through so our legs are a little bit more fresh but i look at is as this year we really have an experienced team and its been exciting because you can move farther along in things that you want to do in terms of communication and things of that nature and things that you want to do on the field
53834 im the type of person that i like hard work i like to be out on the field and to sweat a little bit more and get the grind going on but i think its definitely beneficial as we go through plays and do different things different blitzes and things of that nature you get to walk through and see exactly where you are going to be today we are going to add some noise to it so its going to give us the effect of being at home if youre defense and away if youre playing offense so its definitely going to be interesting to see how that plays out today
53835 hes ready to go i see him growing a lot from last year to this year i mean he really knows what hes doing hes comfortable hes confident in what hes doing hes going to give us another safety back there who can step in there and not miss a beat so i look for us to be fresh back there at all times hes going to be a great player in this league
53836 he has a lot of talent hes just learning everybody knows when you come into this system as a rookie its a lot to learn a lot to grasp and to digest but hes doing a good job with that and hes taking it in and making plays here and there
53837 the mindset that i take is that im a rookie i look at it like that i come in here that its time for me to go in here and fight for a job again and fight for a spot on the roster im in meetings and i take notes just like i did when i was a rookie just to go over things even if its things that i know just to keep me in that habit keep me in that mind frame you never know it all i see derrick brooks and ronde barber theyre doing the same thing and looking at those guys i learned from them over the years so if theyre doing it there must be something right with it
53838 you know last year was just great i think in 2006 i think i lost a little bit of confidence in my abilities i think that was the biggest problem i doubted myself when everybody else wasnt last year has taught me that you dont doubt yourself youre here for a reason and when you cant play anymore youll know it and until then just go out there and play hard and just go off your instincts
53839 i have been looking forward to that since we lost to the giants i have been looking forward to that for a long time in training camp i dont really get to hit anybody and the mentality in practice and the mentality in the game is totally different at least for me in practice these are my teammates i want these guys to make it through the day but in a game i know i can hit this dude and he can be out for the game and i can be fine with it its a totally different mentality
53840 sergey has come into the defensive back room and he has fit right in hes one of us he has a great personality in a defensive back room there are a lot of different personalities me included but hes a great fit and i think hes going to provide some spark for us im sure he has some stories being over there in russia traveling to london and amsterdam and things of that nature so hes going to fit in just fine
53841 hey maybe ill be a good and cooler father if i take my daughters phone away at 9 oclock everynight

53854 we are of the view that it would be singularly unwise to be committing australian men and women into theatres of operation without a clear understanding why we are going there what and how we are seeking to achieve it and when the job is done and when the men and women are coming home
53855 it would just be bad bad policy to do that
53856 the relevant agencies were unable to provide us with the level of mental health data the level of detail that we required
53857 you feel that you have done 120 per cent for the australian defence force and the country and when you come back you become ill and all the adf seem to be doing is wanting to get rid of you
53858 it was really the case of the steering failing on the ship as it was going around on the bend going out of the harbour
53859 theres three ships in the port loading and two waiting to come in so we are attempting to refloat the vessel
53860 well be able to pull the vessel off this morning hopefully
53861 if that doesnt work the next high tide is around the same time tomorrow morning so well try additional measures and maybe some additional vessels
53862 theres at the moment no evidence of her taking water and theres no oil spills
53863 but there would be some damage that can only be evaluated once weve removed her
53864 at the end of the day that is certainly a very local government type issue
53865 again being held in judgment by the most incompetent state labor government in history dismissing a council that was extremely proactive in so many outcomes and projects for our area

53873 getting you this door we found it in the ditch what
53874 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
53875 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
53876 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
53877 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window
53878 the panic of last year is over its more orderly now but the financial stresses remain and there will be more difficulties to come
53879 hey baby wanna do a cock stain you can get them white women to do anything

53883 its not easy coming from slower conditions to fast ones
53884 but i have played ivo on all surfaces and he actually gets a greater play on the slower ones
53885 but what are you going to do today if he serves like that maybe if i got the first set i would be sitting here and it would be different but thats not the case
53886 the fact that these people are being sentenced to such long terms shows that these arrests are not about ensuring a harmonious olympics as party officials may try to claim
53887 although falun gong adherents pose no threat whatsoever to the games the olympics are being taken as an excuse to put them behind bars for years
53888 but how do they expect to beat the yankees or red sox then hmm
53889 forget the guys numbers perse and look at how much better he is than an average player at that position
53890 difficult questions youve asked yourself how can a loving god send decent people to hell youve asked yourself is an eternity of suffering consistent with our idea of god as merciful and just i want you to come tonight and well talk about this well find some answers
53891 can a just god send people to hell to suffer for all eternity you better believe it who are we to even think to question the righteousness of god hell is the only place for sinners because of gods mercy and goodness
53892 this is what i believe in now what is in front of me what is hear what i can know what makes sense
53893 caused and continue to cause plantiff great mental physical and nervous pain and suffering
53894 we accept the verdict and respect the jurys decision and now well move on to the sentencing part of the case
53895 he wont hurt no one else in the world like he did those two women
53896 tapi saya pernah melawan ivo di berbagai lapangan dan ia sebenarnya tampil lebih bagus di lapangan yang berkharakter lebih lambat tapi apa yang bisa anda lakukan jika ia melakukan serve yang begitu hebat
53897 mungkin bila saya memenangi set pertama saya akan duduk di sini dan semuanya bakal berbeda tapi bukan itu yang jadi faktanya sekarang ini
53898 one reason for hysteria in these types of scenarios is a widespread misunderstanding of what exactly pressurization is for and what happens if it goes away the masks come dangling out their holsters and people get frantic theres this notion of pressurization as a sort of physiological hell like being at the bottom of the ocean in a deep sea diving bell the qantas crew faced a rapid decompression to which they responded as would be expected by initiating an emergency descent this is standard procedure following any uncontained loss of cabin pressure the pilots first don their oxygen masks then run through a series of five or six steps to establish a rapid descent the plane will lose altitude at several thousand feet per minute the idea is to get to a safely breathable level as quickly as possible over mountainous terrain crews will pre program detailed diversion paths for use at any point where an immediate descent is impossible a safe altitude must always be reachable before supplemental oxygen runs out or you cannot proceed over that area of high terrain this makes certain parts of himalayas for example no fly zones for most commercial aircraft
53899 while the news never fails to report these events it seldom if ever mentions the most important fact you cannot repeat cannot open the doors or emergency hatches of a an airplane in flight the doors cant be opened for the simple reason that cabin pressure wont allow it think of an aircraft door as a drain plug fixed in place by the interior pressure almost all aircraft exits open inward some retract upward into the ceiling others swing outward but they all open inward first and not even the most musclebound human will overcome the force holding them shut at a typical cruising altitude up to eight pounds of pressure are pushing against every square inch of interior fuselage thats 1 152 pounds against each square foot of door a person could conceivably sit there all day tugging on the handle to his or her hearts content the door is not going to open though you might get a red light flashing in the cockpit causing me to spill my coke zero you would need a hydraulic jack and tsa doesnt allow those
53900 i have a doctors appointment later this morning and it doesnt make a lot of sense to come in and leave again and kill an hour of work time on the road when my doctor is a mile from my house so im going to make my calls at home and come in after the appointment call me if you need anything
53901 he wants chicken nuggets apple dippers and chocolate milk from old mcdonalds
53902 good luck with that ask him if he wants an egg mcmuffin instead
53903 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
53904 excuse us fans of teams wholl still be playing in october if we take just a fringe of interest in the outcome
53905 well dont hit anyone with it or theyll kick us out
53906 t t say t there are four freaking ts up there you mouth breather
53907 shut the up about having to sit through commercials and trailers
53908 not since jimmy carter met with hamas has a weasel gotten this much attention
53909 hes getting close is he going to grab him by himself
53910 dude lets get it straight you are laughing at me because you got a part of your dick got cut off
53911 instead of addressing pressing economic problems like soaring inflation the government is trying to divert public attention with this filthy sodomy charade
53912 our ministers waste their time in political intrigue instead of trying to help make the country more competitive
53913 pas leaders have assured me that they have no desire of leaving the pakatan and joining barisan national front or merging with umno
53914 they have kept me informed of their meetings with umno
53915 if umno leaders believe they can rely on pas or other members of pakatan to save their sinking ship they are dreaming
53916 mom mom what are you doing mom i see your tushy
53917 t you are not going to believe what mommy did today
53918 she procedes to tell him that the doc checked my tushy to see how the baby was doing because that is where the baby is going to come out
53919 i think theres a huge potential market for luxury advertisers
53920 you must be licensed if you care for children from more than one family and who are not related to you you dont need a license if you care for your children or those of a relative and children from only one other family
53921 tu dios es la unica verdad los demas estan mal
53922 my dad was really well liked and people always remember that big smile that he had i think i kind of inherited that from him
53923 im the only surviving family member so its really been hard
53924 it allows other neighborhoods a chance to come in to the southside of the city and get a chance to see our resources get a chance to talk to our neighbors and socialize
53925 it makes it easier to know that so many other people loved him so much and that they would love him enough to do something like this

53927 i hope that apple winds up scaring the rest of the carrier groups and handheld developers into adopting some of the progressive things that apples got there i cant say ive got really high hopes for that its really frustrating dealing with a lot of it as you may have noticed from the trailer theres a distinct lack of actual nazis or hitler or any of that in the wolf rpg because t mobile and whoever just get all upset and irritated about such things that might upset their customers and that is frustrating its like very old days nintendo i think nintendo grew up out of that kind of nanny protectionism sort of thing and we can hope that the iphone sends a wake up signal and the other carriers will start thinking of relaxing some of the limits
53928 iphone is obviously significant but its not going to take over the world theres not going to be a billion iphones going out there in china and india and all that the other carriers and the other platforms are still important when you look at the numbers there there could wind up being more people playing games on the mobile phone platforms than on all the other platforms put together when you do wind up finding a good commercial infrastructure and hand me down hardware going into massive markets like china and india so we still care about a lot of things there
53929 last year here we announced quake zero this was an idea that had been born mere weeks before quakecon here we were being a little haphazard about it and i get up and i talk about it and some domain squatter goes and grabs some of the internet names they offered us a considered buyout option for it but we just decided heck were only a month into the development of this were just going to change the name and avoid paying the little blackmailers
53930 its almost good to take some of these little moments of humility where we were thinking it was going to be a six month development project and the gaming side of it really was but the hubris of game developers we were like ah this web development stuff cant be all that tough and that was the thing that really has been the driving factor on the project making sure of all the crap that web developers know about like making it work on all the different platforms and os versions were working our way through that and have brought in some people with that experience
53931 quake live is really special for me in that quake 3 arena was always my favourite game at id i liked the purity of the game and its unfortunately true that you just cant do a fifty dollar boxed game thats that pure for sensible reasons thats a lot of money and people expect a 20 30 million dollar plus development project when you go out and buy a brand new boxed game thats just the reality of what the media heavy triple a title market is and were pushing that with rage and with doom but its a little bit saddening when you have to do everything and the kitchen sink because its expected even if its not exactly what the game is fundamentally about and quake arena was always very pure it is a tournament deathmatch oriented game and to be able to take that back polish it up some and put you into an environment where we can make it you cant go out and charge fifty bucks for something like this but quake is still a hell of a lot of fun
53932 i get asked a lot in interviews if we think in game advertising is something that might be the wave of the future for pc gaming
53933 but if you play quake live today and you look at it the billboards the set up is really tastefully done it feels right the game was always about this arena for combat and now it just has billboards and looks stylish and cool and while we talked about maybe at some point having some kind of a pro mode where you pay extra we wouldnt want to turn off advertising i know thats popular for ad supported stuff where you have an ad supported mode you pay something and the ads go away but if you turn the ads off in quake live it will just look a lot worse the levels would seem empty the website would seem much more dead and it just wouldnt be a positive thing so thats not really an option were even thinking about
53934 one of the big things that was unknown last year but we have a final decision on and im sure its not going to be a popular response but there is no official mod support in quake live as we surveyed all the things that we have to do and we want to do in terms of making the game as robust and seamless and problem free we just really cant support random mods a lot of gameplay types that were popular have been integrated but we do not have an ability to just say heres the sdk for quake live heres a mod let me go start playing
53935 were working with a lot of people on integrating things into quake live as official game styles and modifications and well just have to see how that goes
53936 quake lives not going to be a portal i get asked that a lot its not going to become this place with lots of games where you can go and pick and choose we may look at enemy territory we may wind up supporting doom in some way but they will be separate and distinct projects were not trying to make a new casual gaming destination or something like that
53937 we have a secret weapon we shall cease to be your enemy
53938 i know other families have losses some even have the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child but to lose a child to murder shattered ones belief in humanity
53939 the thoughtless and selfish act took tania from us forever and put an end to the bright future that would have been tanias
53940 we have had to endure a journey of hell frustration and pain searing pain that still to this day rips through my body
53941 we are of the view that it would be singularly unwise to be committing australian men and women into theatres of operation without a clear understanding why we are going there what and how we are seeking to achieve it and when the job is done and when the men and women are coming home
53942 it did its best to keep above 94 us cents but it looks like it just gave way to selling pressure this morning
53943 the real danger for the rba as far as they are concerned is that they dont want to step in too quickly and start cutting rates when there is still inflationary pressures to some extent in the market
53944 they want to be very much certain that a rate cut is warranted
53945 i have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly

53947 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
53948 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
53949 sam qualified this moments later when he realised he had been taken out of context
53950 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment
53951 i think it was a slip i understood what he said i didnt take the double meaning in it i understand why people might
53952 i know james brayshaw did and he took it up with sam
53953 im starting to really in some ways sort of question if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair
53954 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think youve got to take him on face value
53955 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
53956 when given the chance i try to show what i can do
53957 i want to come on strong like i ended up doing last year but also add more were all starting from ground zero here the best players in the coaches mind will be on the field
53958 in the first meeting coach bill belichick always says he doesnt care how long youve played how many pro bowls youve been to or what youve done in this league
53959 its about earning your play time right here on the field he backs up what he says so you have to come out here and earn it
53960 welker and moss have to take care of what they have to take care of and weve got to go on if that was to happen on on a sunday in the season we still have to play we cant postpone it
53961 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
53962 i really dont have any thoughts as far as mark murphy going to mississippi
53963 thats something youre going to have to ask mark about im not involved in the specifics of it i really have no information for you
53964 me haces rememorar otro tiempo lleno de fantas as con tus palabras
53965 we are very proud to associate with the 2009 canada games said natalie larivi re president of transcontinental media
53966 we will be telling the stories of young people from across the country
53967 one of our major challenges is we wanted to make sure that we brought on national companies like transcontinental media that could activate their sponsorship and bring something to p e i other than the two week event he said
53968 regrettably in this country still tier level one athletes professional athletes still come from middle to upper income families and there really isnt a reserve for people who cant afford the arduous training regimes thats required he said
53969 it is simply one of those things that we strongly believe that as the birthplace of confederation that we need to truly celebrate the country lee said
53970 what is missing and this has been an ongoing concern that has been expressed by citizens from one end of charlottetown to the other is that we need a family celebration and it is not something that can take place in the midst of a festival of lights
53971 its a far more friendly place to do that hennessey said noting that its the perfect spot for the fireworks
53972 it would be a family picnic opportunity for people to come and relax and to celebrate canada said lee
53973 alcohol will not be served nor will alcohol be tolerated within the park
53974 it was about 4 a m in the morning and i heard a lot of movement upstairs so i woke my boyfriend up said billie jean mitchell one of the tenants of the westridge crescent apartment building
53975 we started to smell smoke at that point and i looked outside and all i could see was smoke so i walked outside and saw the whole side of our building was on fire
53976 we tried to grab as much stuff as we could to salvage it but then the heat was just too much so we just left the building
53977 your first initial reaction is get everybody out and then you realize all your stuff your belongings everything that you have to live day by day its going on fire and you cant do anything about it
53978 when we arrived on the scene this building was on fire from one side to the other with a large volume of the fire coming out the front of the building the fire was fully involved as we say
53979 this lady came home this morning to find everything that shes worked so hard to make for herself gone she has to basically start from zero mullally said
53980 we havent got anything to connect those two incidents right now hogan said
53981 well have to determine origin and cause of the fire before we can get back to the police
53982 finding land in a developed city to use for sports fields for school is quite often a challenge to do
53983 this block of land has been sitting somewhat unused for a number of years
53984 at the east end of where we are going to develop the new field there will be an area developed for parking by the people who use the field and also to help with access into it through the parking lot that is adjacent to the building that is there today
53985 we recognize that under the existing soil there is some petroleum there is some metals
53986 our approach to it which is quite a normal one is you encapsulate it you basically haul in enough new fill topsoil that you are covering over whats there with an appropriate separation between the sports field playing surface and the existing material
53987 im here today to encourage the council to support the rezoning of the land in question
53988 three its a commitment to an area of the city that has a large seniors population a green space will be provided for them to enjoy and walking trails for them to maintain their health
53989 finally this project is a great example of municipal and provincial co operation not to mention the business community i encourage the city to take advantage of this spirit of co operation today and as often as possible in the future
53990 right now we are at the concept stage wood said
53991 were looking at trying to make the area a destination trying to generate demand
53992 we want to draw more people to come and enjoy it
53993 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
53994 the whale was quite old and i guess nature was calling
53995 this whale was very frail and old looking and its teeth were ground down quite low so it could have been an old animal that came in to die
53996 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
53997 this series and the next series vs worcester are real important for us after what they did to us at the beginning of the year it feels good to give a couple back to them
53998 we really wanted this win after being short and stuff we need to beat these guys these are the teams that are ahead of us
53999 one game at a time though cant think ahead too far
54000 so did joe and hes the only guy that matters it was a curve ball i thought it was up when it crossed i can understand zachary wants to get that call
54001 we probably had one player on the bench and that was it
54002 im just glad that we won it when we did we had first and second three times in a row and we finally got a run in
54003 now im just looking forward to playing for the yankees and maybe i will play against detroit again in the playoffs
54004 they are in the race and im ready to do my job
54005 im sure he was very surprised by this but for him this is a good situation hes going to new york city and they are in contention
54006 pudge had a no trade clause and he waived it today to go to new york
54007 pudge has always wanted to play in new york and detroit felt it needed a relief pitcher so both sides were able to get what they wanted to some degree
54008 its always hard no matter what just one of those things you have to deal with
54009 im going someplace they want me thats how i look at it
54010 i wan to play every day not matter what position so im pumped
54011 did i learn a lot from pudge hes a future hall of famer so watching him makes everybody better im not pudge ill just go out and do what i can
54012 this is a surprise to people if they dont know the situations of the players
54013 both teams get better by this and thats what a trade is supposed to be all about
54014 you talk about a hall of fame catcher coming in here
54015 when you talk to the reporters tell them you love your mom cyr said repeating her instructions
54016 i wish somebody would throw some money at me to see what i could do at a higher level cyr said
54017 im looking for that but im not actively looking for that
54018 people kind of know id be willing to do it it would involve moving and a lot of other changes but id do it if i had the opportunity
54019 its just nice to still be competitive and as greg norman proved at the british open thats the great thing about golf
54020 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
54021 i was born to love you you were born to resist
54022 i took the attitude that you know what if it happens this year im excited if it doesnt then next year
54023 the year before i had gotten to the final and so it was getting closer
54024 toward the end of my career probably around 90 i talked to guys and guys would say to me you know how do you stay there all of the things that are going on and why dont you do something to get out of there
54025 and to me it wasnt my manner it wasnt my personality or my makeup to be that type of person
54026 i dont think he got the attention because he wasnt media friendly like taylor was and we werent winning championships like taylor was
54027 so i dont think people really gave him the attention he probably deserved until now
54028 most of the great ones have a great motor and that is what i remember most about him
54029 the guy who always practiced the hardest was patriots guard john hannah and thats why hes in the hall of fame and tippett would be a close second he went full bore all the time
54030 if you were game planning against him youd have to know where he was very similar to lawrence taylor
54031 if you didnt he was going to make a play on you
54032 it may seem crazy to say this but tip was more of a brute
54033 he was not a thinking mans linebacker he would just want to crush you and run over you
54034 he just played the game with so much intensity i can remember times getting my own sack and hed be so excited hed slap me on the head three or four times
54035 he put up some good numbers when he had people around him
54036 its a known fact that ive been referred to as the lt of the afc
54037 he opened a lot of doors for a lot of other guys to come into the league guys were measured up against him we want to get us an lt we want to get us an andre tippett
54038 the marlins always seem to be in the middle of everything
54039 it takes two to tango were looking everywhere were making calls were getting calls but were not going to be stupid
54040 ive always told you everything is possible there are all sorts of crazy things theres no way to say which trades are going to happen
54041 because we dont fill the stadium every night we have to keep these payrolls moderate
54042 we cannot trade away the farm for a two month push but we are looking when youre in the middle of the race youre in the middle of things
54043 as good a chance to win the division as the mets and phillies
54044 i cant say teams are exactly lining up to deal with the marlins at the moment
54045 but i always said if i didnt play with denver the one place i would want to play is atlanta and it just happened to completely fall into place
54046 its really been a blessing just to come back home
54047 when you get the ball down there and are not able to put it in the end zone youve got to have a guy who can put it between the pipes
54048 thats something jason has done for a long time we were excited to be able to acquire him and i know hes been really anxious to get back here to atlanta this is his home
54049 ill sleep very well at night knowing its going to be 70 degrees with no wind when i get out there
54050 the thing i realized six seven eight years ago was hey the average attempt in the nfl is 35 yards
54051 when i go out there to kick a 42 yard field goal it doesnt have to go 55 yards it only has to go 43 so i changed up some stuff
54052 i remember jack nicklaus saying one time that in a round of golf 75 percent of his shots were mis hits but no one ever knew it because the ball always went so straight its about the same with me to be honest with you
54053 when i was young i could crush it i hit some beautiful balls wide right they were way up in the net it was very impressive but you dont get any points for that i just want to make field goals
54054 when we signed elam i was like thats three for sure
54055 if we get to the 40 and go three and out its all still good
54056 its the only major that i havent won two or three times if i could win this week then i would say ive pretty much achieved everything that i possibly can
54057 my expectations are always high i believe in myself and i know i can play this golf course
54058 but the competition is tough and you just dont know but im going to try and stay as competitive as possible
54059 i knew i could do it it was just a matter of time and i just needed to stay patient
54060 it was not for me a lot of pressure and relief it was more something that i knew was going to happen i have a lot of faith in my game
54061 it really put me in a different position as a player and also for other players to see my level of golf
54062 and so thats what im trying to repeat this year
54063 this golf course is like playing in the states but at the same time theres so many different shots you can play from everywhere
54064 your creativity and your imagination has to really come out this week
54065 right now we strongly believe he is possibly in the phenix city or columbus area
54066 it took two engine companies approximately 15 minutes to bring the blaze under control
54067 the house was one of about six abandoned structures scheduled to be torn down
54068 the home was fairly small to begin with so the fire pretty much completely gutted the structure
54069 i consider it a privilege to have this opportunity to serve as the schools principal
54070 the aeec is renowned for its outstanding achievements and the worldwide recognition it has received and were going to continue to build on that success
54071 the city of valley was once home to a large textile industry
54072 however when the mills closed brownfields were left behind unfortunately these brownfield sites have become a prime hinderance to economic expansion in the area
54073 we are remodeling the front entrance way to give us not only more room but also so that traffic flows through there better
54074 theres more handicapped access and aesthetically it looks great its well worth the renovation
54075 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
54076 i was born to love you you were born to resist
54077 we came out strong they south carolina went up 5 3 on us we got kind of nervous
54078 thats a real important award we showed a lot of class up there
54079 were proud about that thats just as important as the world series title
54080 weve got good kids here from opelika and auburn they all played together and came together
54081 i was born to love you you were born to resist
54082 the long range effects of this disaster without the fema programs requested will be devastating and lasting
54083 we dont want to wait any longer before we get fema inspectors to homes and businesses
54084 we anticipate upgrading the driving while intoxicated charge to intoxication manslaughter
54085 this grant is the result of dollar general corp s commitment to supporting literacy initiatives and terris staff reaching out to support the uhrichs ville dennison community
54086 without the generosity of those shoppers who agree to support literacy when asked by employees the grant would not have been awarded to our area this grant is an example of pure community partnering
54087 we need x ramirez does x well so well look past y and z
54088 many people out there are in pain their hearts are in pain help them to islam
54089 we hope we can rely on you to promote our activities glad to hear islam is still thriving in singapore one of my favorite places in the world
54090 even though they have tweaked a number of rules for the game there is still a substantial amount of details that are similar
54091 its still a 15 by 15 board and you get seven letters with point value
54092 here they have changed some of the rules but the overall premise is pretty much the same
54093 in the bullpen if i pitched poorly i always felt better if i had a day off to see what i was doing wrong
54094 lets say you have mechanical problems and youre not throwing a certain pitch the way you want to if you dont have time to make the adjustment you go out there two or three or four outings in a row you get your butt kicked whereas as a starter you have a few days to look it over and work on it
54095 i mean i want to get back out there obviously because my last outing wasnt what i was hoping for
54096 but its not like im sitting in here saying oh my god i cant wait to pitch again when my time comes my time comes
54097 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
54098 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
54099 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
54100 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
54101 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
54102 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
54103 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
54104 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
54105 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
54106 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
54107 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
54108 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
54109 latroy gives us another experienced quality arm for our bullpen
54110 we tried to sign him during the offseason and lost out to the yankees but we are happy to have him here for the remainder of the season he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
54111 it was one of those things where if i ever got the chance to play for the yankees i certainly didnt want to pass up on that opportunity
54112 no disrespect to the astros or anything like that but it was one of those things that i wanted to do at one point in my career and the opportunity presented itself
54113 we ended up getting a deal done for an experienced relief pitcher who we think can go back on the back end and help brocail and sampson and the other guys who weve been using late and help us get the job done
54114 i told myself that i was going to stay in shape
54115 if i got traded i got traded or if i had to wait the full 10 days and get released and then sign with another team that was the way i was going to go i just wanted the chance to pitch again this year
54116 he seemed very pleased with the opportunity hes going to get here
54117 we wanted to add some depth to the bullpen some experience
54118 its a deal we started talking about last weekend and it came together this morning
54119 we felt the opportunity to acquire a young pitcher made sense as we look toward 2009 and beyond
54120 pedro grifol our minor league field coordinator has known gaby for several years and believes he has a chance to help us in the future
54121 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
54122 he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game

54201 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
54202 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
54203 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
54204 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
54205 in that sense hes going to have to move something he hasnt characteristically done in his entire career
54206 people have said to me from the day that i took this job they said look its the worst job in australia in politics
54207 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
54208 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election
54209 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
54210 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
54211 sam qualified this moments later when he realised hed been taken out of context
54212 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment
54213 i think it was a slip i understood what he said i didnt take the double meaning in it i understand why people might
54214 i know james brayshaw did and he took it up with sam
54215 im starting to really in some ways sort of question if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair
54216 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think youve got to take him on face value
54217 that resulted in the ship swinging to starboard on exiting the port and running aground at beacon 44
54218 i will defend myself as i would defend myself against any natural catastrophe
54219 i was arrested irregularly for three days i was kidnapped i was kept in a place my rights were not read out to me i had no right to a telephone
54220 in return the united states of america would fulfill their commitments
54221 i was in danger of being liquidated because i had made a commitment
54222 i negotiated a very tough deal he had to step down immediately from both his posts as president of the serb part of bosnia and as head of his party and he did so
54223 but when he disappeared he put out a piece of disinformation that i had cut a deal with him if he disappeared we wouldnt pursue him that was a completely false statement
54224 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
54225 he stole the ground from under our feet and he took the sky from above our heads he killed our sons
54226 and what we get in return is a theatre performance the world is looking at this as if it were a spectacle
54227 people are supporting antonio villaraigosa because hes a person who as mayor is out there and willing to take some risks
54228 hes willing to take on some of the challenges that have sat dormant for a long long time
54229 i think its more of a question of when not if
54230 the question is is this the right time or some time down the road
54231 its frustrating because the career politicians can raise that much in 15 minutes at one of their cocktail fundraisers
54232 the issue that brought him a lot of trouble is essentially personal
54233 this is a great opportunity for us to show chinese readers what first class journalism we can deliver
54234 but of course we will also want to check if the site is still available after the olympics have ended
54235 this is a good sign its a work in progress these are initial encouraging signs
54236 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
54237 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof

54239 esto nos llev a pensar que est bamos ante una inmunodeficiencia por lo que hicimos un an lisis gen tico a los ni os
54240 esto hace pensar que en el ser humano hay otros mecanismos que compensan la deficiencia gen tica alternativas para que el sistema inmunitario act e

54243 but although there is clearly a demand for electric cars the only way for them to become a viable option is to have a sufficient infrastructure in place
54244 even with oil prices coming off a recent high consumers will be squeezed by high petrol and food prices rising home heating bills come winter and the continuation of the credit crunch until well into 2009
54245 we forecast that sales volumes will contract in july september the first such fall since early 2006 the next 12 months are shaping up to be the slowest period for retailers since the early 1990s
54246 our quarterly surveys have shown that there were 29 profit warnings by general retailers in the first six months of 2008 the highest number of warnings ever recorded by the sector in the first half
54247 in line with deteriorating economic fundamentals we believe even tougher times lie ahead with little evidence of a retail recovery until 2010
54248 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it he told sky news
54249 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
54250 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
54251 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted he said
54252 i know other families have losses some even have the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child but to lose a child to murder shattered ones belief in humanity
54253 the thoughtless and selfish act took tania from us forever and put an end to the bright future that would have been tanias
54254 what was to happen a week later would shatter our lives forever
54255 we have had to endure a journey of hell frustration and pain searing pain that still to this day rips through my body
54256 i will live with the pain and heartache for the rest of my life
54257 just day to day life of trying to keep my family together is a nightmare
54258 this should never have happened nothing has been achieved by this senseless death
54259 there is a hole in my family a hole that can never be filled
54260 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
54261 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
54262 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
54263 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
54264 the clearance of the pathwork test is another step in the continued integration of molecular based medicine into standard practice
54265 the adverse outcomes of assisted fertilization that we noted compared with those in the general population could therefore be attributable to the factors leading to infertility rather than to factors related to the reproductive technology
54266 considering that 1 to 4 percent of all newborns in europe are conceived after assisted reproductive technology art safety concerns are important reducing the number of multiple births has made improvements but we need to gain a better biological understanding of the reasons why infertility and ovarian stimulation may have adverse effects on infant health consequently we have to continuously monitor the short and long term risks of art
54267 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
54268 the idea has been around for almost a decade now
54269 the initial notion was to use the vaccine approach to prevent amyloid deposition injecting amyloid so the body would attack the deposits now we are into phase two injecting the antibody itself

54272 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
54273 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment
54274 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
54275 we are moving towards understanding whether there were or could be places on mars that are habitable
54276 no doubt the jobs data will generate a host of opinions but the market is likely waiting for a surprise whether be it an upside or a downside as the next catalyst
54277 im completely off the hook because they admitted they had the wrong guy
54278 rape was the furthest thing from my mind ive never raped anybody i thought maybe i had insulted somebody or there was a bill i didnt pay and when they took me in and sat me down and told me it was criminal and that i had a rape charge ive never felt that kind of a rush go through my body
54279 thats like being told you have cancer i mean when somebody attaches that to your name theres not a whole lot worse that can be attached to it i think child molestation might be worse murder might be worse though in some cases it might be better if its in your own defense thats just one thing you dont want tagged with your name
54280 there were a lot of people just poised to say something about me or my band or any member of our band so when this came out they were all over it immediately i started losing some of the products i was putting out people refusing my posters in stores it was a gnarly gnarly thing to happen
54281 the worst thing was when i went to a wal mart to pick up a cooler or something and theres this woman in her mid 30s whos probably a poison fan because she seemed to have recognized me and she grabs her four year old girl and just takes her around the corner to get her out of my line of sight as quick as she could that just hurt normally someone would say this is my daughter shes a future poison fan im used to that but im not used to someone taking their kid away because theyre scared of me
54282 man it would be nice if i had a quick easy unit testing environment to test stuff out as i write this
54283 a multiple violation of this law will result in a jail sentence of not more than 20 years

54311 or ashley hansen further up the ground on a wing
54312 federal precedent dating as far back as 1807 contemplates that even the executive is bound to comply with duly issued subpoenas

54322 you may have to live with some pain for the rest of your life
54323 vertebral axial decompression therapy for pain associated with herniated or degenerated disc or facet syndrome an outcome study
54324 data was collected from twenty two medical centers for patients who received vax d therapy for low pain which was sometimes accompanied by referred leg pain only patients who received at least ten sessions and had a diagnosis of herniated disc degenerative disc or facet syndrome which were confirmed by diagnostic imaging were included in this study a total of 778 cases the data contained the patients quantitative assessments of their own pain mobility and ability to carry out the usual activities of daily living the treatment was successful in 72 of the 778 cases when success was defined as a reduction in pain to 0 or 1 on a 0 5 scale improvements in mobility and activities of daily living correlated strongly with pain reduction
54325 failed back syndrome should not be considered candidates for further surgery until a reasonable trial of vertebral axial decompression has been tried
54326 there is so much variability in making a diagnosis that this initial step i
54327 a confirmatory imaging study is indicated only if surgery is contemplated
54328 its a miracle i feel like a whole new person
54329 i was in such pain from a chronic slipped vertebra that i couldnt bear to sit then lying down was the only way to relieve the pain i was afraid id be this way for the rest of my life
54330 the patient lies face down on the extendable table the upper body resting over the stationary portion holding on to adjustable handgrips that can be released at any time for safety
54331 as the table separates hydraulically the harness gently pulls the lumbar spine downward decompressing the vertebrae and the intervertebral discs a typical half hour session consists of fifteen 15 alternating cycles of distraction and relaxation lasting 1 minute each in most cases the desired results are achieved within 20 30 daily sessions
54332 the nerves in the lower back supply the legs so if you take the pressure off the nerves to the legs you have more power
54333 prior to the introduction of vax d a non surgical method for disc decompression was unavailable in numerous studies conventional traction has never demonstrated a reduction of intradiscal pressure to negative ranges on the contrary many traction devices actually caused an increase due to reflex muscle spasm
54334 the powerful negative pressure from the vacuum draws back the herniated disc into its proper orientation draws nutrient rich spinal fluid into the disc and stimulates repair cells effectively mending the disc
54335 vax d is the most promising non surgical medical treatment for lumbar pain to be developed in many years
54336 izzat will program the effects like robot voices or just voices that a normal human would not make
54337 the boys are so gagah strong so i appreciate having extra powers
54338 we also wanted to experiment with it because so far in malaysia we have only noticed vocal effects used in recordings not live
54339 now people talk about our lights as much as our music its become something of a trademark sometimes fans even request the venue to turn off their lights before we play
54340 its the song and lights together that form our music
54341 the boys come up with the music and i write the lyrics to almost all the songs
54342 its true even my mother doesnt get a chance to write any
54343 we genuinely enjoy ourselves onstage everytime we perform we make music we like and enjoy so its always satisfying to see people enjoy themselves too
54344 we once played at a place called taat house and even though it wasnt full it felt full when we played because everyone was one with the music
54345 the first time we played in johor bahru was at city plaza and we had never had so many people standing in front of us like that before
54346 even if its 20 people as long as its 20 people sweating and dancing their hearts out
54347 the attention we have now we didnt even aim for we just wanted to have fun onstage and try to be fresh for that were always thankful for our fans
54348 one of our fans even wrote us saying he dreamt of our basslines
54349 were already at 47 this year were looking at over 100 in terms of investigations right now that tells us there are some issues here
54350 were saying that right now based on the number of cases were seeing and what we know nationally has happened its time to get more stringent guidelines around these water parks
54351 i can charge him with bribery or perjury because he told a lie in a sworn statement
54352 submit to a lie detector test to see whos telling the truth
54353 if you will not accept we will look for other ways
54354 it would be a waste if you dont accept the p10 million your children may blame you later
54355 up against the billions of the lopezes so i am up against everything
54356 what would it take or you to resist the governments offer
54357 empowering isabela voters to reclaim their democratic right to elect leaders of their own choosing and to contribute as full partners in their own development

54359 the numbers are down because there were restrictions put on us obviously hud is thrilled because they see the number is down its all about funding if the numbers are down they can say the needs not there

54361 we dont feel it would be appropriate to comment on an on going investigation
54362 i know its still under investigation but im not real happy with it we should know more especially when theyre asking for 18 million
54363 im very happy with the response at this point because we dont have any legal information or findings at this point and i dont like rumor or innuendo so i prefer the findings come in first
54364 yeah a little surprised i thought people would be a little more anxious than that and upset but as weve tried to assure people at this point they are allegations and its a criminal investigation and thats all we know
54365 no they found means they found mobility theyve always had willpower you dont lose your willpower when you dont have anywhere to go as an independent

54371 wed like to see a nationally consistent and consumer friendly unit pricing system
54372 we dont want to end up with a prescriptive regulatory approach keeping a lid on regulatory costs will help keep a lid on prices
54373 it really is a customer service it helps customers work out where the value is
54374 there is a cost but to us its nowhere near the sort of cost woolworths and coles are talking about
54375 what consumers are going to get is one month old information for a range of goods that may only be a small part of their shopping basket
54376 this mornings economic numbers were disappointing unemployment is a concern
54377 i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything very positive to say about himself

54379 many saudi women are now involved in small scale industries
54380 women can play a big role in light industries such as gold jewellery and foodstuffs
54381 why dont we develop women only industrial zones for this purpose
54382 it created new job opportunities for saudi women and helped them make important contributions to the banking and financial sector

54388 there is hundreds of millions of pounds sloshing around in england for this sort of stuff but in scotland we are largely relying on volunteers this is something that needs to be looked at
54389 the weapon of a position that has been turned into a culture builds the homeland of the resistance it has become the culture of the generations that will realize the dream of annihilating that plundering entity allow me to commemorate a great legendary commander the martyred hero and mujahid imad mughniya i would like to say just one thing hajj imad we will only be worthy of the blood you sacrificed when we force this enemy to long for your times
54390 there is a disease in this region called the state of israel which we refer to as the plundering entity if we do not put an end to this disease it will follow us even if we flee to the end of the world so its better to get rid of it

54392 after years of embarrassing negotiations italy and libya seem to be ready to settle the legacy short but particularly bitter of the italian colonial adventure in the north african country which fascist dictator benito mussolini liked to call the
54393 commission for the promotion of virtue and vice prevention moutwa
54394 unfortunately the landings could not be avoided by a decree law but through launch of the agreement with libya which envisages patrol of the waters of the north african country but this could not be done without the agreement of libya when we have its agreement there will not be landings on lampedusa anymore
54395 prime minister berluconi went to libya a few days ago to speak about that with gaddafi foreign minister frattini is very active everything we could do we did it we have been already examining the ports where to put the bases
54396 we cannot do than welcome them and this is the first stage but then there is a second stage if they do not have the right to stay in italy they will return at home
54397 uh oh im getting a walkie we gotta pull over

54400 i dont want to give the impression on this blog that walking through this process is easy just because we are trusting in god

54412 i continue to believe that is imperative that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
54413 i am pleased that a majority has agreed that the commission both has the authority to and in fact will stop broadband service providers when they block or interfere with subscribers access
54414 reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
54415 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
54416 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
54417 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
54418 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue

54426 this figure is nominally higher than the previous record of 158 4 million kg in 2006
54427 this converts to another record of 624 million dollars a massive 42 percent more than last years record of 439 million dollars for the january to june period
54428 this accounts for the substantial increase in the revenue generated from the export of tea

54444 we cant give up any of the pitchers we have first baseman justin morneau said
54445 they are the reason we are here and where we are at
54446 doing nothing was better that what they did last year he said
54447 letting go through intolerance and apathy one thing i have said over and over for several years is that the higher realms are not what you might think much of what we have been taught or read about is highly inaccurate although this is not a simple process basically it all boils down to simplicity and how energy responds and interacts with itself there are higher and lower forms of vibrating energy creating things that feel good and things that do not so then there is no meaning to anything meaning is simply what we choose to place on any particular manifestation some things may feel good to one person according to how they interpret them and may feel very unpleasant to another a rule of thumb then might be that things either feel good or they feel bad its that simple as we begin to vibrate higher and higher we become less and less of a match to what has been created so far on this planet and also to any lower vibrating aspects of other human behaviors and realities one might think that as we become more spiritual we embody a great compassion understanding and tolerance at higher levels than we ever have before but this is not the case as we progress through ascension and begin to vibrate higher and higher we find ourselves becoming highly intolerant of any lower vibrating energies we simply cannot be in their presence for very long and we may even become angry and frustrated with them as well there is a method to this madness as mentioned in earlier sections of this book there is a hierarchy to energetic levels and dimensions when we reach higher realities it is very difficult to reside or spend time in the lower realities we are simply not a match to them anymore this response also has other benefits the intolerance greatly encourages us to create more on the outside that matches how we are vibrating feeling and being on the inside if our outside reality feels downright awful we will most assuredly be inspired to save ourselves through our need to feel better by creating higher ways of living and being and by not tolerating and refusing to be a part of the old reality as we literally cannot stomach it anymore it makes us literally refuse to participate therefore withdrawing any energy of support if we do not become involved in something and negate it it cannot survive because there is no energy to make it real and alive it will simply cease to be as it will not be residing in anyones consciousness through this intolerance we are also being very direct as we progress into higher vibrating human beings we find that we can no longer beat around the bush sit by and watch or take a long winding road to get anywhere higher energy moves in a straight shot it does not go here and there make excuses and support friends and family even though they are in unhealthy situations or sit blindly by it is simple and direct no wishy washy uncertainty and passivity the time is up for tolerating the old and for waiting its the higher way or no way at some level we know this and at times can find ourselves addressing the lower vibrations very directly in this way this is a higher form of love it involves an inability to support the lower vibrations in anything we are actually being supportive and loving in that we are now supporting the highest ways through this intolerance we are actually being spiritual warriors of higher truth and greatly helping others in the higher realms we create through a partnership with source and as we are becoming more and more of source ourselves we must connect much more deeply now in order to create the higher ways during these years of ascension it can appear that we are getting absolutely nowhere it may seem that nothing ever goes our way or that we are receiving very little support for getting what we want this is really not the case we do not want to create things that are not of a higher vibration or that will no longer fit in the near future in other ways we cannot create from ego in the higher realms when we are not getting what we want it is usually because we wont be in that situation or reality very soon or that we are not yet ready if there is something that you really feel you must have then you are not ready to receive it it is ironic that we always get what we want when we no longer want it what is happening here is that we have lost our attachment which places us in a position for perfect creating in addition we are not then creating from our ego this is all part of the ascension process through it all we can get pretty discouraged at times when we get discouraged and let down over and over again and feel that all our dreams have shattered we become apathetic this is perfect it puts us into a space of letting go we simply do not care anymore this makes us let go and release the energy of attachment we are then residing in neutral energy with no agendas and this allows much more of source to enter and of course allows us to let go of many of the illusions

54456 ive spent my whole life trying to keep up with nuno there was actually too much material we were doing a song or two a day and we wound up with 23 or 24 songs in a two week writing session
54457 we knew within an hour of gary and i getting back together to write that we still had something relevant to offer
54458 and while there are great bands out there from muse to the raconteurs we felt like there was a void as far as straight up rock and roll goes
54459 it didnt take long for us to be reminded of what we were capable of
54460 we always knew extreme was special we always knew it was a matter of time
54461 it expresses a longing an underlying sadness for something or someone thats been missing in your life and never quite sure if it will ever return in this case for us its rock and roll saudades de rock
54462 i like how it expresses that longing weve been feeling to play for our fans and be together again

54475 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment
54476 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
54477 we are moving towards understanding whether there were or could be places on mars that are habitable

54500 trim the moustache and grow the beard and be different from the magiians fire worshippers
54501 women who imitate men and men who imitate women are not from us
54502 shaving the beard is an innovation introduced to the muslim countries by the christians who formerly invaded and conquered the muslim lands
54503 how would you feel if the messenger of allaah were to turn away from you in disgust and say
54504 it is forbidden to shave the beard only the efffeminate do so
54505 how would you feel if the messenger of allaah were to turn away from you in disgust and say
54506 they the muslim scholars agreed that shaving of the beard is a form of mutilation which is forbidden
54507 whoever obeys me has obeyed allaah and whoever disobeys me has disobeyed allaah
54508 shaving the beard is haraam forbidden no scholar has ever permitted it
54509 one of my fellow prisoners in guant namo was at sea on an american ship with about 50 others before coming to guant namo he was in the cage next to me he told me that there were about 50 other people on the ship they were all closed off in the bottom of the ship the prisoner commented to me that it was like something you see on tv the people held on the ship were beaten even more severely than in guant namo
54510 they choose ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers we will eventually reunite these ghost prisoners with their legal rights
54511 i am not directly familiar with what amer haleem or anwar al awlaki say about this
54512 i do not completely reject this consensus trend and in fact embrace some aspects of it
54513 im very proud for myself and the marvelous cast and crew i had on this film
54514 as we worked on it i knew that we were making something special michael fassbender who plays bobby sands is a star as are liam cunningham and stuart graham and our young actors liam mcmahon and brian milligan they are the weight heart and soul of the film
54515 children of a mixed message how the generational dynamics have weakened the muslim community in america and made it harder to raise our families
54516 the major spiritual dynamics and forces of social change within our muslim american community
54517 take a good look at who we muslims in america are becoming and whats become of us the most significant aspects of our life and identity like our personal and communal worship of god virtually all the signs of meaningful relationship with him and our intramural coummunity cohesion and family conditions have deteriorated not improved and dramatically so over the last decade the vast majority of us do not practice islam
54518 being danced between the muslim american pioneer generation and their gen x now thirty something children
54519 together they have captained our community to a clear cut shift toward relativism as a rationale for questionable conduct and doubtful communal judgment
54520 does our community have direction or are we just flying by the seat of our pants
54521 the kind of writings or communications needed for our community are epistles pointedly addressed to us that awaken and connect us to the mission inspiriting message of the quran and its messenger sallallahu alayhe wa sallam statements that remind us of why we are alive and what in the world we muslims are here for what is our purpose under heaven
54522 a dawah to gain acceptance not by presenting our message forthrightly even if alone like the prophet s allallahu alayhe wa sallam from the hillock of safa but by following the spiritually desiccated example of the faith communities that have devolved before us in america
54523 notwithstanding the continuous presence of islam on the continent before there even was an american polity these are the pioneers of the american muslim community we are part of today they could hardly have been a more miscellaneous lot
54524 almost to a person they had made a dramatic hijrah from circumstances and ways of life and with sacrifices hardly imaginable to their children out of the various mainstreams from which they hailed as well as from the mother of all modern american culture the progressive secular mainstream
54525 to recognize that psychologically they had exited the mainstram and migrated toward islam having committed to their own internal reform they sought at the same time to reenter the mainstream but via the message of islam
54526 the story of muslim generation x within the institutional establishment becomes very much an ethnic immigrant one
54527 rejection of the immigrant based movement paradigm and a call to return to an idyllic spiritual or classical archetype of islam
54528 never exited teh american mainstream on the contrary mainstream american culture verified
54529 this is the generation that has institutionalized the dual or some might say
54530 they learned an amazing amount about the historical elements constructs and scholarly streams within islam but in the end they converted their considerable talents exposure and insights into business tools mostly for the conscienceless mega corporations and banks they almost invariably ended up joining
54531 religious knowledge to them is a great and noble thing but we should not let it interfere with our lives or only so much as it confirms our whims
54532 islaam is built upon five pillars to testify that none is worthy of worship except allaah and that muhammad is the messenger of allaah to establish prayer to pay zakaah poor due to fast the month of ramadhaan and to perform hajj to the house of allaah for whomsoever has the means
54533 faith is to believe in allaah that he is the one and only lord and creator who alone has the right to be worshipped and that he has names and attributes confirmed in the qur aan and sunnah which are not shared by any of his creatures his angels created by allaah from light they perform certain duties assigned to them and they are totally obedient to allaah his books the toraah the injeel the zaboor and the qur aan which confirms and fulfills the previous revelations his messengers the bearers of revelation sent to mankind the first was noah and the last was muhammad the final day the day of resurrection when man will be judged and to believe in qadr allaahs divine decree both good and bad i e to be content with whatever allaah has decreed for us while taking the precautions and lawful causes that lead to the desired result
54534 worship allaah alone and avoid the taaghoot one who calls to the worship of false gods and he is a devil soorah 16 36

54561 i probably learned 50 as much as i did in law school during the barbri study period the piece de resistance was the amazing barbri conviser mini review this book is so efficiently and logically organized that it would give just about anyone a great introduction to the workings of the law it should be required reading for students before their first semester of law school it should be required reading at least at some point during law school professors just hide the ball and let students wallow in chopped up and dismember cases lacking context in aimless casebooks casebooks are for the most part pretty awful and most study guides are just okay but the conviser mini review is brilliant the thing is students should be given a better education a great overview in all aspects of black letter law early on so that they can gain context for the law and move on to more advanced and complex legal issues professors let students wander aimlessly the professors ramble aimlessly and many first year students have little context for the structure of the law not an optimal state for learning and developing ideas and skills i even had professors who discouraged the use of any study aids which can give students a good idea of the scope and structure of the law as opposed to just being a crutch law school is bizarre in this way no overview and context is given for the law across many areas of the law in a tight highly structured manner as in the conviser mini review which is a shame students learning behaviors and information processing habits have probably changed quite a deal since the early days of the socratic method law schools take note so all future law students buy a copy of the conviser mini review on amazon or ebay and get ready for a better understanding of the law coming in so that in three years youll be attaining levels of understanding and attacking interesting legal issues in an informed and well developed manner law schools take note once again you are being very irresponsible in keeping such well formatted basic information away from law students in favor of meandering casebooks and meandering socratic method classroom interactions no wonder so many law students are zoning out on the internet in class they know they are smarter than what is required in class they know the professors are lazily hiding the ball give students good holistic legal information and overviews instead of horrible casebooks and lazy lectures a good basis for more advanced idea formation and study and a new revived generation of legal scholars may emerge
54562 macius low performance was not so obvious because he is notorious for missing golden opportunities and no one ever expects much from a low performer like him whose goal scoring to missing ratio is 1 10 he rose to prominence because he had a striking partner like roy who created all goal scoring opportunities for him
54563 such players should be proud that they are playing in a team like labasa which has given them fame as prominent soccer players in the country
54564 i had a lot of respect for pita bolaitoga and never expected him to engage in such a despicable act

54567 anil sharma should not continue denying the claims because the beans were spilled by a drunk navua official in the beer parlour moreover he should not bad mouth the labasa president to cover up his acts

54571 if we get her out of here that will be setting the tone to get kwame kilpatrick out too thats part of my motivation but i just dont think shes done the job when you look at her you can see why her son has an aura of entitlement the arrogance that shes shown has shaped him
54572 we all have family members who we might not be too proud of but we should all be judged on what we do when youre talking about your children thats a sensitive area ive got kids theyre grown but if somebody wants to call them out about something it still rankles me
54573 no one has run against her kilpatrick who has any record of service or credibility i serve on the senate appropriations committee and i have served the community well i keep people informed and i deal with their issues thats what people deserve
54574 when she speaks our colleagues listen im dazzled by her knowledge of the policy
54575 i admire her kilpatrick being a good and loyal mom
54576 she still comes to washington every day as an outsider asking what does this mean for my district were going in to january with great optimism and hope we need a bigger vision for health care we want to send our dollars to the midwest not the middle east
54577 there were certain behaviors on mr silvas part that went against the case plan and the visitation agreements and those behaviors were seen as potentially harmful to the child
54578 i went ahead and let him read it i wanted him to know what was going on
54579 we do have a child here who has to deal with a lot i am giving you as much information as i can
54580 i didnt call no one i just let him read the article it was a verbal agreement
54581 that cant be a co incidence it has to be tied to the article
54582 if they are suspending his visitation because the child read the article and then had a conversation with the father about the article and nothing more thats outrageous and appalling

54594 why would protesters go to denver if they were not going to have access to the site of the dnc
54595 a balancing test between security needs and protesters free speech rights
54596 a place is an integral component to a protesters message
54597 people are coming to denver in order to be seen at the site of the dnc

54600 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
54601 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
54602 were not in the habit of reacting every time they put out a statement
54603 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
54604 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
54605 this is a potentially risky comment to make for a campaign already under increasing criticism for some of the claims its made over the past week
54606 talk about the race card and injection of it into the debate can result in a negative backlash you can ask the clinton campaign about that
54607 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
54608 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
54609 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
54610 thats a definition of madness but thats what john mccain is offering hes offering bush economic policies and karl rove politics
54611 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid
54612 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
54613 these anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day
54614 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing my opponent john mccain thinks were on the right track
54615 some of my little friends say there is no santa claus
54616 papa says if you see it in the sun its so

54619 the continued association of diabetes with a number of birth defects highlights the importance of increasing the number of women who receive the best possible preconception care especially for those diagnosed with diabetes
54620 early and effective management of diabetes for pregnant women is critical in helping to not only prevent birth defects but also to reduce the risk for other health complications for them and their children
54621 first im going to repeal the 22nd amendment just think of the irony when all my supporters realize that it wasnt bush that became a dictator but me theyd better get used to it too ill be jul 21 2008 at 9 40 pm

54626 the roads they have not been fixed it since arroyo came to power
54627 you do not have to spend a long time in this town to realize how much people resent the government
54628 there is plenty of money but they put it in their pockets
54629 our world has grown weary of greed exploitation and division of the tedium of false idols and piecemeal responses and the pain of false promises
54630 shoeperman we will heel you save your sole and even dye for you
54631 hes gone today he was good guy in the community
54632 he loved children always liked to laugh and joke he moved out of town a few years ago to give himself a fresh start and somebody viciously and maliciously took his life tonight
54633 campus greening is still at the heart of what we do but with a renewed purpose encouraging campuses to make lowering emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases the goal of greening efforts
54634 companies like wal mart will give more shelf space to those companies that can reduce their footprint employees demanding more from companies they work for is another clear force that creates a compelling business need its tough enough to compete for the best talent without turning them off on values driven and environmental issues
54635 there are multiple benefits to all environmental initiatives so the language we use to impart the message has to mirror that diversity
54636 for example if im promoting an energy conservation initiative such as a lighting retrofit for warner brothers facilities i will need to alter my message based upon my audience i need to address the financial savings on our utility bill to the finance folks the labor and maintenance benefits to the technicians in the field and the quality of light with clients or tenants of the facility
54637 a great tactic is to look around and find something that the person youre talking to really cares about ive found that a universally powerful topic is children if you can get people take a second to think about their children and the effect that their choices might have on them they seem to open up and be much more willing to consider higher causes like the environment
54638 24 hour exemption from all existential torment in connection with the environmental crisis

54644 if it was up to me id like to finish in the top 10 in poles and make the finals in stakes
54645 i would love to win the team penning for my teammate clayton eggers because this is his last year
54646 it would be nice to win the world championship for him and his family
54647 this is my second year that i will be in more than one event
54648 in 2004 i was ninth in the stakes race overall the two horses that ive been riding are easy keepers which means that i can ride them for a couple of days give them a couple of days off and they will just pick up where they left off so long as you keep them exercised
54649 at a lot of these shows you get certain points and each year that ive gone to the world championships ive gone by invitation
54650 i havent qualified by points but ive done enough that ive gotten invited to each one
54651 she is a phenomenal kid who trains herself in a world where some of these kids are running around on horses that cost six figures
54652 jennifer is real mature for her age and she loves to compete she does have family and friends that will help her but when it comes down to taking care of her horses she is doing it all on her own
54653 a lot of the credit for this of course goes to my family and great friends
54654 my family has grown up in ranching so we were just born to be on a horse my brother jake bouse paved the way for me he is the one that i learned all the ins and outs of the game tricks of the trade
54655 i run the patterns in my head before i get there
54656 one thing i do tend to do is overthink things like this
54657 when i became a man i put aside childish things
54658 the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands at moments of comfort and conveyance but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy
54659 all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god
54660 this game provided for me by keeping me in school when i was growing up because i had three older brothers that quit school and never finished because they werent involved in anything
54661 besides all the friendships that i met along the way it allowed me to stay and finish school that is what baseball has done for me
54662 it was me and curtis mayo who were selected that year by the lake jackson team to play on their all star team
54663 we used to play on anderson street on a vacant lot it was basically a cow pasture but we turned it into a baseball field
54664 lake jackson and old ocean were the only teams with fences
54665 lake jackson played on gator field and old ocean on phillips petroleum for the rest of us if there was a ball hit in the gap or something wed be running forever to catch it
54666 it was mostly made up of hispanics and they called it semipro but we didnt get paid
54667 i was 14 years old and i was playing with grown men our coach was donato calderon and hed put me in somewhere because i could hit the ball
54668 he was a pretty good lefty on the mound with some speed
54669 but he had a better bat than most of the other guys
54670 our coach would not let us play unless if we went to church
54671 so we went to church because i wanted to play sometimes we used to ride in produce trucks just to get to games looking back at it it was fun doing stuff like that
54672 we beat bay city 8 2 and in those years we could only go far as the regional
54673 we lost to jasper 14 4 and back then there were no state champs in 2a
54674 the 7th corps came looking for players and i tried out and made it
54675 we joined the army league and traveled to barcelona spain france and germany to play our games whenever we traveled to these games we stayed at the hospitals because they were like barracks
54676 i played with them for two years and when the season rolled around i went to tdy temporary duty from may to mid august
54677 we didnt win any championships but i played with jim boles who was a pitcher in the cincinnati reds farm system also david marushin a detroit tiger first baseman and bobby joe mason now bobby joe was an all american basketball player from bradley university later on he went to play for the harlem globetrotters
54678 i just thought doing 60 feet was a lot better it was a drastic change to go from baseball to slow pitch softball but after a couple of weeks i got adjusted
54679 i remember my last at bat i hit a home run
54680 the catcher who i knew i told him as i was crossing home plate that was it i was done playing for good
54681 we didnt have the big fields or aluminum bats or big gloves
54682 prut thou beginnest early what did the little mary say to that
54683 oh she liked it and she kissed me and i liked it dont little boys like little girls
54684 mom it isnt that bad except the board is tilted but hey if you fall it is a straight shot down to the ocean
54685 come on mom it wont be so bad come on and watch me
54686 ready or not here i come you can t hide
54687 its not legalising its decriminalising of the prostitutes most of them are in it not by choice
54688 a couple people saw that and ordered it right away so i couldnt really take it down at that point
54689 the situation is critical we are currently on life support
54690 theres no question that some neighborhoods and maybe most of manhattan is really oversaturated when it comes to chain stores
54691 clearly this does present a lot of problems for the mom and pop businesses out there
54692 wherever i go i see subways a lot of chain restaurants on every street
54693 theres no question in my mind that theres far more national chains here in the city today than five or 10 years ago
54694 part of the reason we did this is because the mom and pop business is suffering in large parts of the city
54695 maybe some of this data could be used to help spur innovative solutions
54696 when you see a dunkin donuts on every corner people are going to go to them instead of a small coffee shop its not because of the quality its because of the name
54697 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
54698 it definitely gets you nervous when you see them out there talking up a storm and everything like that when you get out there you just play football you dont try to think about that you just try to do what you have to do within the play and within the scheme of the offense and just try to help out as much as possible but going against those guys knowing what kind of a reputation they do have definitely is intimidating at times
54699 i think its more of tough love they just tell me to have high expectations for yourself the scheme somewhat is what im familiar with at uconn from previous years it definitely is a lot to learn within the scheme because its a lot more complicated i think im picking it up kind of smoothly but i still have a long way to go
54700 i really have no control over it i just have to make the best out of the situation that im in each time i come out of the practice field whether were inside or outside i just have to go out there and compete
54701 just trying to play as strong as possible all the time i put myself in the best situation that i can basically listen to coach mike maser my offensive line coach and him giving me the proper fundamentals and techniques that puts me in the position to be that way
54702 i think my run blocking was a big concern for me but with the techniques ive been learning its definitely made it a little bit easier and i still have a long way to go in the run blocking also with pass protection i have to move my feet a lot more theyre a lot faster at this level then they are in college im just trying to adjust to the speed of the pass rusher so moving my feet is a big thing also in pass protection
54703 all the time hes told me to set off the ball a lot more when im up too close sometimes the defenders can get a jump on me make sure that in certain situations you have to know what it is you have to know if you have to get out of your stance quicker on third and long because they are really going to be putting their ears back and coming just listening to vernon vernon knows what hes talking about samsons satele been out there for a year justin smiley has been in this this has been his fifth year and jakes long a great player just listen to all of those guys then you have the guys behind you that have played before too everyone around me has been giving me tips and really helping me out
54704 when i found out it was the biggest relief knowing that justin a five year vet was my roommate

54740 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
54741 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
54742 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
54743 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
54744 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
54745 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
54746 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
54747 the us and the uk must at last come clean about the scope of extraordinary rendition and secret detention a violation of american and british law human rights standards and the rules and regulations of nato both congress and parliament must set the record straight about what happened at diego garcia phr knows from our twenty one year history of documenting torture around the world that secret detention opens the floodgates to torture and other gross human rights abuses
54748 the bush administrations detainee treatment and interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation as human rights leader seven years of secrets whispered in secret rooms must give way to on the record testimony and open hearings
54749 the cia and the department of defense categorically deny having interrogated any terrorist suspects or terrorism related detainee on diego garcia in any cases since september 11 2001 with the exceptions of the two cases in 2002 in which detainees transited diego garcia that previously have been disclosed to the uk government there have been no other instances in which terrorist suspects or terrorism related detainees transited or were held there
54750 the u s government is holding prisoners in a secret system of offshore prisons beyond the reach of adequate supervision accountability or law
54751 this faq also covers older versions of suns webserver including the 3 x 4 x and 6 0 releases
54752 q i have many connections in close wait what does this mean
54753 i think people want choices they understand that weve got to address this issue and they want some leadership to get it done
54754 its something that ill remember forever just like the first hit i got last year
54755 to get a home run and give us the lead is definitely a positive
54756 we leave the ball up thats whats going to happen
54757 you make a mistake theyll make you pay for it
54758 the rangers are a great hitting team but going into the game i just tried to keep them guessing
54759 he kept the guys off balance and did a great job
54760 israel considers this to be a real and serious danger
54761 the israeli enemys persistence in its violations of lebanese airspace territorial waters and territory especially during the past few days is an unacceptable provocative escalation that calls for condemnation and serious action on the part of the concerned lebanese authorities as well as the un bodies
54762 i think they are oiling up their 57mm guns again
54763 the israeli overflights have increased lately and it looks like the israelis are provoking hizballah into showing their deployments
54764 they are allowing diplomacy a chance in order for it to fail
54765 by filing a quite unprecedented complaint they are holding the un and the lebanese government accountable which means hizballah is paving the way for a military response
54766 they need to keep some surprises left in case of another war
54767 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
54768 diese ank ndigung des k nigs ist eigentlich nichts anderes als die fortsetzung des kurses den er schon bei seiner amts bernahme eingeschlagen hat er hat von anfang an gesagt dass er seine entscheidungen mit dem premierminister abstimmen will
54769 und erst k rzlich hat er vier erfahrene lords ernannt die ihn in seiner k nftigen funktion beraten sollen und diese funktion soll nach seinem willen entpolitisiert werden
54770 die kosten f r das fest sind wirklich sehr hoch wenn man die derzeitige wirtschaftliche situation des landes ber cksichtigt ich m chte nicht sagen dass es falsch ist geld f r das kr nungsfest auszugeben aber die regierung sollte bedenken wie das land zurzeit wirtschaftlich dasteht
54771 ich glaube wir gehen in diese richtung manchen im land geht das zu schnell aber das britische system ist die richtung in die der k nig dr ngt seiner meinung nach ist das die beste l sung f r das volk und f r tonga insgesamt
54772 the owners of the star ledger announced today they will sell the newspaper if they cannot win union concessions and persuade a large number of non union full time workers to take buyouts in the next two months
54773 despite the best efforts of all of us the star ledger is losing a battle to survive
54774 if the ledger is to have a future it must make further changes in how it operates
54775 hell hath no fury like a fanboy scorned or why exactly must keith uhlich die
54776 why so serious indeed if ever a tagline was perfectly suited to a film and the critical audience adoration of it it would have to be this three word gem created by a marketing superhero for christopher nolans the dark knight the film that currently sits at 1 on the imdb top 250 films of all time and has been proven to cure cancer put an end to all wars and solve erectile dysfunction as with most long underwear films why must superheroes wear tights its not uncommon for the legion of fanboys and girls to take it as a personal affront when confronted with a dissenting opinion however if you consider the emotional and financial investment given to comic books figurines and other items related to the mythology its not terribly surprising that anyone daring to criticize the celluloid representation of their idol is treated like a heretic yet with the dark knight the seething anger and raging bile thats been ejaculated on dozens if not hundreds of pages of comments all over the interweb far exceeds the typical zealotry nolans film is stirring up reactions and emotions that ive heretofore never encountered and ive spent the past few days trying to figure out why
54777 the contrast in my first two viewings of chicago still summarizes what i admire about it and what i dont
54778 governor arnold schwarzenegger of california has moved to end a budget crisis by sacking 22 000 state workers and ordering pay cuts for 200 000 the most populous state in the us faces a budget deficit of more than 15bn 7 6bn and legislators are struggling to agree a spending plan the cuts which will save 100m a month are designed to put pressure on politicians to end the budget crisis but a leading official in the state challenged the decision to cut pay california has one of the largest economies in the world and it has no way to pay contractors for many of the services it provides some 30 american states face budget deficits caused by rising costs and falling revenues in a slumping economy but californias is by far the largest
54779 we shall find peace we shall hear the angels we shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds
54780 when americans go to the grocery store the last thing on their mind should be the safety of the foods they are bringing home to serve their families the recent salmonella outbreak highlights the current vulnerability of our food supply and the need to modernize our food safety laws we cannot afford to wait until the next food borne illness outbreak or an intentional attack on our food supply occurs for congress to act on this bipartisan legislation to ensure the safety of our food and restore confidence in the quality of these products for american families
54781 while she was waiting in the line a cement block crashed through the suspended ceiling of the day room completely without warning
54782 the falling cement block struck oconnell in the head face and chest area
54783 she basically is going to be put in this position of waiting for all the insurance companies trying to figure whos liable and for how much
54784 the problem is theres so many people who share responsibility and they want to fight about that before they settle
54785 it came in as a 911 call as an emergency medical dispatch and that there had been an individual who had suffered a possible gunshot wound
54786 when we responded we found out that it was the administrative officer of court security who had been injured in his foot from his duty weapon after suffering an accidental discharge
54787 i thought they all carried their weapons on their waist or shoulder
54788 we really havent had the chance to discuss it with him because when we arrived there he was already being attended to by some of his fellow co workers and they were administering first aid as paramedics were arriving to take him to the hospital
54789 well notify the administrative office of the courts about our findings and get information from them regarding his qualifications and his length of employment and basic background information that we need
54790 well also be communicating with the attorney generals office and the county attorneys office just to bring them up to speed with the nature of our investigation
54791 everybody wants to see me out there the coaches want to see me out there my family and friends want to see me out there i want to see me out there its a great opportunity for me
54792 i dont think so i think its a year for me to step up and start over again
54793 once i get out there and show everyone what i can do there wont be any more problems
54794 you can have the best guy in the world out there and if he doesnt get the ball no one will know about him
54795 coming in and not having the anxiety of not being a rookie and knowing what to expect helps a lot
54796 i know a lot more of the defense better im able to work at a faster pace
54797 i like the fact that here they treat you like men
54798 they expect you to come in and do your job you know whats expected of you get it done and theres no problems you dont get it done then theres a problem im trying to get it done
54799 i you know i seen well i seen you on the news for what for shooting an officer oh hell no come on an officer really
54800 they leave a huge hole to fill no question about it not a whole lot of guys who can step into their rookie year and perform the way they did
54801 were going to need a big year from trevor lewis were going to need more scoring from brady murray and the depth players we had in the past
54802 its going to be scoring by committee with those guys taking a big step forward you have to score goals to win games
54803 no question weve made up some ground goaltending our goaltending shouldnt be an issue those guys performed great for us last year and i expect theyre going to have to again
54804 josh kidd erie otters ohl and davis drewiske wisconsin are two good additions they have good size and theyre very workmanlike
54805 whoever falls from the kings camp will be a guy who has already played here and proven himself at this level
54806 im glad its been manny this manny that and its time to focus on something else and start winning some games
54807 it wasnt a surprise to me it just ends this big saga thats been going on for years now
54808 he wants to be traded then he flip flops and says he wants to be here for the rest of his career then he wants to be traded well now thats finally been decided
54809 to me its a shame because i think hes an important part of the team but hes not irreplaceable if he was unhappy and the red sox were unhappy this was the best thing they couldve done were getting a young player that has potential hes going to reach his peak while hes with the red sox manny is kind of on that back slide of his career maybe it was time to get rid of him
54810 i think a lot of guys in our organization would almost like to be traded because the red sox are such a hard team to break in with
54811 i dont know what the situation was obviously both sides werent too happy for me theres more impact of seeing hansen and moss go with him that opens up some spots and youll probably see a trickle down effect of guys getting moved up
54812 its good i knew moss personally and i hate to see him go at the same time it kind of helps my chances
54813 you know there was so much talk and rumors and nobody thought he was really going to be traded i guess all that changed yesterday when he said the red sox didnt deserve to have him in boston
54814 ive always liked manny but after the way hes been talking about the team downgrading the whole team and management ive had enough of manny for a while
54815 i dont think it will hurt the team at all look at what happened when they traded nomar garciaparra it was probably the best trade they ever made
54816 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team
54817 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
54818 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
54819 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation
54820 the nations news organizations continue to generate dismal diversity numbers year after year ten by 2010 is a significant step in the right direction
54821 i could not agree more with the judge good for her
54822 manchester is becoming just another urban combat zone just read the paper or watch tv the first 10 minutes of news or front page of the paper is always about crime in manchester
54823 i am certain that judge abramson misspoke when she characterized manchester in such a negative light i am certain she is aware of the great strides we have made as a city and that she too is hopeful for our future removing criminals from our streets helps assure that future and i am thankful that the judge has aided us in this endeavor
54824 is wholly inaccurate and fails to recognize that manchester is a city that has turned the corner and is on the road to recovery and renaissance
54825 meet the people of manchester themselves not the ilk of this world like the aforementioned ms landry and you will meet people who love manchester and expect a bright future for their city
54826 by almost any standard of comparison manchester has a lower crime rate than any other city its size in the country we are proud to live in such a safe and vibrant community
54827 shes a young girl she did make a bad mistake and she did ruin a lot of lives in the process yes she did but i feel sorry for her family
54828 it hurts me no drugs were ever found in my house and no one was ever doing drugs in my house
54829 the judge set an example landry did not get away with it
54830 while i do wish the judge had used different words to describe the city in which i live i do give her credit for handing out a stiff sentence its quite clear the majority of society wants stiff sentences for violent crimes and it is a judges duty to serve societys interests through interpretation of the law
54831 i am upset that judge abramson said our city is an unsafe place to live yes we have crime but we also have people who are trying to clean it up when you state that we are a crime ridden city you send the wrong message
54832 the acts of some are not a reflection on the city as a whole and the judge should be ashamed at her lack of temperament in situations she presides over
54833 its a shame landry should have never received any jail time i hope she receives a fair hearing during her sentence review shame on the judge for giving the city a bad rap as well i hope the state takes censure measures against her
54834 thats what i told my husband it was meant to be of course all day long after winning the auction friends were calling to ask if id managed to pick him up off the floor yet
54835 my husband and i thought wouldnt that be lovely for my play my thought was to have the garments in the foyer so when people come out of the theater at intermission they can have a look at her real clothes i was going to swoop up all three of them not realizing the rest of the world wanted them too
54836 i only dressed in black queen victoria was in mourning for most of her life and i felt better and more comfortable wearing black when i was writing the play in the evening by candlelight
54837 i dont know whats going to happen next with the play but i have plenty to occupy my time like the 12 000 photographs in my basement i need to catalogue from the big dig
54838 i will do everything i can to seat those delegations
54839 all of the delegates will be on the floor and nh will be in the front of the hall
54840 if were being asked to choose between protecting and preserving the first in the nation primary or being a delegate to the national convention well give up our delegates
54841 it is our sense the overwhelming majority of the rnc supports enforcing the current rules
54842 we place protecting and institutionalizing the first in the nation primary ahead of having 12 or 24 delegates
54843 taking our medicine enhances our chances of earning support from the other states
54844 how is what we do in july 2008 going to doom us in 2012 is it our job to appease the rnc we ought to stand up for the primary
54845 republicans believe in states rights so i dont know where they get off dictating to new hampshire or anyone else how or when they should be holding their primaries
54846 broken his pledge to new hampshire and its first in the nation primary
54847 it is more important that we have the first in the nation primary intact than to fight the sanctions that are in place now
54848 short sighted view of new hampshires role states should be able to proceed under their own traditions and laws
54849 it sends an important message that were unified as a party and no one is cutting anyone out
54850 it makes no difference because were all going to be there people swap passes all the time ill be happy with whatever they come up with because its going to be a unanimous vote anyway im more concerned with not losing our first in the nation status
54851 i have plenty to say about it but lets keep a lid on it our one job is to get john mccain elected and we dont need to be running around biting each other in the rear ends
54852 its not going to impact any of the delegates experiences at the convention but part of me thinks we should never give an inch on the primary
54853 and when we get there if we are all sitting there and some are voting and some arent its not a big deal
54854 we never knew sununu to support either socialism or tax hikes schip is a popular program and we can understand the senators desire to support it but this expansion is a bad deal he shouldve stuck to his principles and voted against it
54855 im not arguing that the commission wasnt right they were right it was a compliance issue and its a fineable issue and well pay the fine
54856 it was not fraud there was not one document that affected the loan it was disclosures to the state and pulling credit reports and things like that and half of them were our own checklists that we create for a loan
54857 there was no defrauding of customers not one customer got defrauded a penny ever
54858 someone looking at that seeing that consumers signatures were affixed to documents they didnt sign that certainly would give a regulator or anyone else cause to think that harm is being done to the consumer and we need to make sure that doesnt happen
54859 so it raises the ante a little bit and it certainly has gotten their attention as you would expect
54860 in this case if theyve had a problem with the company they should contact us and well look into it
54861 i will get this resolved the thing that concerns me is our reputation
54862 we have been one of the largest retailers in the country since 2000
54863 that should give you an idea of the concentration of business we have in the area
54864 where are all the complaints that say hey i got cheated do you see any i hope people just take that into consideration
54865 even if i shut the business down i want the people to know that we never cheated one customer ever not even overcharged i bet theres not a company in the state that makes less per loan than we do im saying we do it in volume
54866 i just want people to know what it is if it was fraud we dont just get to pay a fine wed be closed down ive got some decisions to make on where to go with the company at this point
54867 how about the 120 people we employ the other 80 to 100 or so who work for us as appraisers and closers that work in association with the mortgage industry
54868 so everybody loses their job and you know what without a single complaint from a customer in 18 years it just seems to be a shame but ill take what comes
54869 we are working with the banking department and having continuing discussions with them and are prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure the banking department is completely satisfied with the company amp apos s practices and procedures
54870 the company obviously takes the allegations very seriously and is working very diligently to address each and every one of the concerns raised by the banking department
54871 if you want a mortgage or other loan go to a bank if they say no you cant afford it listen to them
54872 it is my understanding that all 24 delegates and alternates will be submitted to the rnc and we will deal with any that are not certified at the convention
54873 we are not able to submit a full slate of 24 delegates and 21 alternates we can submit 12 and 12
54874 all the early states four others were punished by the rnc for going early are being handled this way however we do continue to hear informally and formally through multiple channels that the rest will be accommodated in a way that should satisfy us floor access etc but there are no guarantees at this time i think most of our delegation understands this and is ok with it
54875 what are we contesting if we dont submit all 24 and have them cut us by 50 percent
54876 all of the delegates including the early ones will be on the floor and nh will be in the front of the hall
54877 call the person doing the registration if they dont know of this yet advise them that we were informed from me through black and davis of this decision
54878 my understanding is the plan as i hear it is to have them on the floor and theyd be able to be on the floor and not be voting
54879 my position is that new hampshire is entitled to all its votes
54880 thats been our contention and its my understanding that its always been john mccains contention i will announce that new hampshire is casting all 24 votes for john mccain and if they want to shut off my microphone so be it
54881 is one of the few guys who keeps picking up the flag and running up the hill
54882 end the billions in government giveaways to big oil to crack down on the price gouging thats keeping gas prices so high and to invest in renewable energy and give consumers more cleaner energy choices
54883 aggressive voter contact plan including mail phone calls and earned and paid media
54884 my heart was pounding and i was overwhelmed with admiration fear and the urge to take pictures
54885 if only the seribu islands that could be like this
54886 perhaps permatang pauh will be the birth place of a prime minister
54887 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
54888 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
54889 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress
54890 indeed the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process
54891 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
54892 the practical significance of the opinion will depend chiefly on whether the investigations persist into the next congress and on how the new administration responds
54893 interesting questions yet presented about the authority of an ex president to make even qualified executive privilege claims on behalf of his former aides
54894 could have saved themselves a lot of trouble if they had allowed these aides to go to the hill to testify to show they were willing to play ball
54895 people are supporting antonio villaraigosa because hes a person who as mayor is out there and willing to take some risks
54896 hes willing to take on some of the challenges that have sat dormant for a long long time
54897 i think its more of a question of when not if
54898 the question is is this the right time or some time down the road
54899 its frustrating because the career politicians can raise that much in 15 minutes at one of their cocktail fundraisers
54900 the issue that brought him a lot of trouble is essentially personal
54901 each man takes care that his neighbor shall not cheat him but a day comes when he begins to care that he does not cheat his neighbor then all goes well he has changed his market cart into a chariot of the sun
54902 its no different than a couple of kids playing with a ball or somebody surfing or laying there getting a suntan
54903 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
54904 we might as well have just got robbed by a bunch of thugs downtown
54905 this is an action with the federal government which is sad
54906 because these laws need to be revisited in washington especially the medical marijuana law were incarcerating people by the tens of thousands were destroying peoples lives and people who have a medical marijuana legitimacy are caught in the middle its a problem we need to resolve this conflict is totally unacceptable
54907 we heard some noise outside and then the door literally burst in and the dea came in in full combat gear told everybody to get on the floor and put their hands behind their heads
54908 paid my taxes every quarter since last year ive paid my taxes
54909 controlled substances including marijuana derivatives thereof and edible products containing marijuana receipts notes ledgers records reflecting the proceeds of those activities electronic equipment photographs negatives videotapes films addresses and or telephone books records documents programs applications
54910 please go down with signs and friends to show your support
54911 the best of los angeles medical cannabis as well as several different types of clones new patients receive a free gift with their first purchase we are open from 11 a m to 10 p m every day with free secure parking and friendly vibes
54912 suffer from migraines cancer glaucoma depression arthritis nausea anorexia aids insomnia chronic pain or any other disorders
54913 medicinal marijuana might be for you come meet with our doctor and see if you qualify
54914 do not resort to political movements engage in formalism leaders need to be sober minded and do not let work be influenced
54915 as one gets old one should voluntarily step down otherwise one is easy to make mistakes just as i have become old i have poor memory and speak stutteringly so old people like us should step down and wholeheartedly support the young to take over
54916 more open to outside world more relaxed at home and more power delegation to lower levels
54917 die plattformen stehen im l und nichts wird dagegen unternommen das schlimme ist dass sie rund um die uhr jeden tag l in die nordsee einleiten
54918 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways
54919 i know other families have losses some even have the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child but to lose a child to murder shattered ones belief in humanity
54920 the thoughtless and selfish act took tania from us forever and put an end to the bright future that would have been tanias
54921 we have had to endure a journey of hell frustration and pain searing pain that still to this day rips through my body
54922 for something to drive that behaviour there must have been some significant stuff going on in his head
54923 i know our generation is going to make it through life with jobs and being financially stable val but i worry about the children
54924 you and i have made it growing up through the depression as children ourselves and as young adults through a world war
54925 our kids will survive adapt to their surroundings and thrive in love and life as much as fate permits
54926 it is not so much that they the women are suffering from an inability to conceive but an impatience to do so set against a bleak backdrop in which almost everything else about their lifestyle has a negative impact
54927 a lot of people drink as a way to relax but studies have shown that alcohol directly impacts fertility in women its thought to affect reproductive hormones leading to an abnormal menstrual cycle
54928 women today work incredibly hard they get up they have breakfast on the run they check their blackberrys last thing at night and they fall into bed at the end of the day exhausted
54929 the human body remarkable as it is is extremely complex and sensitive to factors such as stress and anxiety especially when it comes to reproduction and if you are having sex just once a week or once a month conception is not necessarily going to be straightforward
54930 next thing the couple are arguing and bitter feelings and resentment provide another barrier to sex which in turn affects conception and all this may happen in a far shorter time frame than the average seven months it takes to conceive
54931 going to school in the fall im looking for the ideal alarm clock to beat the late nights and what not and noticed a few digital photo frames alarm clocks i want a decent that has battery backup and good resolution on the screen for viewing photos an auxiliary audio jack would be a major plus which one do you guys recommend that falls under the 200 dollar mark thanks a million
54932 he kicked ted penn in the groin he kicked ted penn in the mouth
54933 is this the first time youve told anyone about this
54934 at any time did you see russell snyder doing any kicking
54935 well ive been approached for president of the united states but ive declined so far
54936 very pleased with the verdict on count two but very disappointed with the verdict on count one
54937 this case hinged on testimony mr and mrs snyder testified as to what happened obviously the jury rejected that and did not believe that testimony
54938 when theres a situation with obvious violence like this this isnt about roseland politics this is about citizens of st joseph county and thats got to be presented to a jury they made their decision
54939 i didnt know how that zantac was going to affect me
54940 i wasnt even taking it even though i said i was that was my intent to start taking it that day but i never did
54941 we never got a chance to explore that because we didnt get the information until the trial started
54942 all of that testimony about mr penns medication was outside the presence of the jury the jury never heard any of that i dont know where it would have led
54943 david got half of what he shouldve got am i happy i dont really care either way i just wanted him to admit guilt and the jury had to admit guilt for him
54944 whether or not the jury found that it doesnt change the fact of what they know and what i know but the jury is the final authority so if they say hes not guilty of that i live with that
54945 im going to kill you and if you tell anyone about this assault im really going to kill you
54946 i did bend down i said are you ok he told me to leave him alone
54947 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
54948 were not in the habit of reacting every time they put out a statement
54949 they said they were paying more attention to the race
54950 theres so many misconceptions about school food service that its really sad
54951 in minneapolis the lunches werent too terrible but they were bad enough
54952 but the breakfasts tended to be worse because there was usually one processed item offered
54953 we take exception to this group and the way they put together their data
54954 theyve done some research and thrown out a report thats biased
54955 our products arent the same products you would get in the grocery store
54956 minneapolis is one of the better districts among those that were failing
54957 quite often the victims of these diseases are embarrassed and just seem to disappear
54958 this causes social isolation and loneliness and quite often escalates the problems already being faced
54959 only by raising awareness of these issues and supporting people in the places they are in will changes occur
54960 the construction certificate will go out imminently if all the information is there this week
54961 the sticking point was a policy in regard to the use of the facility and that policy has now been passed by council
54962 were now in the position to pass a construction certificate to commence work
54963 the third of august is the turning of the sod
54964 and were going to be full steam ahead as soon as the warmer weather hits
54965 as far as i can tell nothing else needs to be done were waiting on the construction certificate which hopefully council will get to this week
54966 i think some of them actually dont believe im doing it
54967 every time i go down the street someone asks me whens it going to happen
54968 its been a very long drawn out process and hopefully it will all be good in the end
54969 ive had positive comments from people all over australia who have seen our designs on the web
54970 were confident that in the overall study regardless of what comes out of the whole component lake rowlands will show up as more than feasible
54971 it sets the lake rowlands proposal back another 12 months but once its completed if the overall project goes ahead lake rowlands will be stage 1
54972 we were hoping to get the go ahead to move on lake rowlands before that but were pleased that it was included in the study rather than being canned altogether
54973 whats helped the lake rowlands project along now is the whole drought situation it highlighted the need to look for more water in the area
54974 it wont provide water or help the water shortage in the short term but its a long term proposition for water security

54976 music fans might soon have their ipods searched by customs officers at airport checks and face jail if a large amount of pirated music is found on them
54977 met mijn hand op mijn hart en op de gezondheid van iedereen die me lief is durf ik te roepen dat ik dit n it heb gezegd
54978 van kouwen mag dat voor de tuchtcommissie nog een keer doen als hij me recht in de ogen durft te kijken
54979 de situatie in de 92e minuut was als volgt vvv was in de aanval en tommie van der leegte beging een lichte overtreding door iemand vast te houden e n of twee seconden na het fluitsignaal trapte hij de bal uit de draai veertig meter weg waarna ik hem geel gaf en hij dat ook zonder meer accepteerde
54980 afellay kwam van twintig of dertig meter aangerend zei allerlei onvriendelijke maar geen kwetsende dingen en plaatste zijn voorhoofd vlak voor het mijne hij was de hele wedstrijd al aan het zeuren hetgeen ik bewust negeerde dit was een stap te ver waardoor ik besloot ook hem geel te geven en hem toevoegde je bent een vervelend typetje niks meer en niks minder dus totaal iets anders dan nu in de pers staat en afellay voor een of andere camera heeft geroepen
54981 ik vind het echt heel laag dat afellay dit doet
54982 tussen het eindsignaal en de strafschoppenserie zei hij al ik ga je pakken ik ga je pakken voor een camera in mijn optiek moeten afellay en van kouwen me wel verkeerd hebben verstaan
54983 ik fluit nu zeventien jaar in het betaalde voetbal en heb dit soort taal nog n it gebezigd als een speler vuile tyfushond tegen me zou zeggen gaf ik hem direct rood en hoopte ik dat de knvb hem hard zou straffen
54984 ik ben voor niemand bang heb niets te verbergen als er een onderzoek komt wil ik afellay en van kouwen graag in de ogen kijken het is heel vervelend als je van iets wordt beschuldigd dat je niet hebt gedaan
54985 maar ik ga nu eerst maar eens met de knvb in conclaaf welke weg we gaan bewandelen
54986 hypervigilance is when people have an on guard type of feeling
54987 also some of them may actively choose not to travel by bus or the sight of a bus depot or any bus might trigger flashbacks and nightmares people who are more vulnerable might go into depression and have anxiety attacks some people may get into the habit of doing drugs and alcohol to get rid of these painful memories
54988 people should talk about it and not bottle up their emotions try to resume their normal routines and use relaxation techniques
54989 its a possibility he was intoxicated with drugs its not fair to say he has a mental illness
54990 sometimes when people are intoxicated with street drugs they may start hallucinating and getting paranoid
54991 some will feel very stunned theyll speak almost in a monotone flat voice and recount it in small short sentences while others are very animated it depends on the individual
54992 certainly the first few hours after an event like that there will be some adrenaline associated with what you see
54993 there may have been people behind the attacker who were trapped or at least felt trapped while this was going on and they were trying to figure out how to get off the bus there were lots of different experiences in a confined space
54994 if you dont do something physical afterwards the byproducts of that reaction are stored up in your body and people tend to feel lousy after
54995 not all but some can feel very tired and lethargic some may feel that they cant calm down they may have this sense that something else is going to happen and theyre still not safe
54996 if youre a smoker be aware that moderation is important there too
54997 when we have a lot of stress we sometimes reach for another cigarette and were adding stimulants or depressants to a system thats already been through a shock as you recover
54998 you dont have to recount the whole experience but certainly its helpful for people to say what it felt like to be there and identify the emotions and the facts that went with it
54999 most people recover in a few days or a few weeks after an experience like this almost all will
55000 we cant say to someone nothing like that will ever happen again because we dont know down the road what anyone will go through but say youre safe here with me and if you want to talk id be happy to listen and offer a comforting place for someone if they want to shed some tears or if they feel fearful
55001 if youd prefer come over to my house and ill spin some vinyl
55002 the switch to manual only has to be on the machine you want to play the ipod on right
55003 theres only a few people around the world that are doing it
55004 if we can give a drug that provides this long term relief i think were on to something much more effective and perhaps at the root of the illness
55005 there might be a whole new class of antidepressant drugs out there within a few years
55006 its a tough cohort to get weve collected four brains like that in three years
55007 weve identified a fundamental process that controls the patterning of gene expression
55008 weve shown that it is disturbed in a neurological disorder
55009 we do not appreciate what we have until we lose it

55021 mens hair should not cover their eyebrows ears or touch their collar
55022 women should comb their hair appropriately for age occupation and situation
55023 you know this is really one of north dakotas hidden gems
55024 they used it as a community center and that is what it was used for and the kids wrote save our gym dont tear down the gym and you know we came into town and if we didnt do that the school would be torn down
55025 i tell you what the community is excellent the community has brought in old jersies cheerleading outfits football uniforms i mean you name it track uniforms letterman jackets we have all of that we are going to incorporate it in the main dining room when we get that going
55026 weve had a lot of people say it feels weird drinking in the school that i went to you know x amount of years ago i was going to school here and now i am drinking here
55027 we started with the dream of north dakota branded beef and the retail store and our goal was to provide north dakota beef that was born raised and processed here to the people of north dakota
55028 and alvin and i faced that decision up in harvey either we are too big to go local there or we were too small to compete nationally and we just didnt have the experience or the backing to set up national meat distribution out of the harvey plant
55029 i am very excited because i was in tears i just didnt want to close the store in bismarck and so when we were able to make arrangements to do the processing in other places then we can keep it open and keep true to our words born raised and processed in north dakota
55030 we dont have enough slots for every child to go into a parochial school or a private school and what you would see is a huge drain of resources out of the public schools
55031 but what i dont want to do is to see a diminished commitment to the public schools to the point where all we have are the hardest to teach kids with the least involved parents with the most disabilities in the public schools
55032 thats going to make things worse and were going to lose the commitment to public schools that i think have been so important to building this country
55033 if we have vouchers well then the public schools would only be left with the worst kids
55034 were in a cycle of inspection drilling blasting and scaling to make it stable so we dont really know the rock just falls down to the road where the other debris was and then we plan on as soon as we can well get in there with equipment and move it out of there
55035 what another essay i cant believe were still writing essays in third year
55036 cadel evans managed to stay with the leaders during the tour de frances sixteenth stage overnight
55037 we have one wish it is to make the beijing olympic games a global sports gathering a success
55038 the beijing olympic games belongs to the chinese people and more importantly to people across the world
55039 i dont think that politicizing the games will do anything to advance the issues it goes against the shared aspirations of people from around the world
55040 focus more on the environment and controlling pollution we want to pay more attention to improving peoples lives
55041 two and i finally sent off a six thousand word essay on for possible publication
55042 i remember when i was an activist a lot of the information i picked up about how people were dealing with things was through similar kinds of educational activities
55043 you also discovered many times you werent the only one dealing with those types of problems
55044 it helps you out plus it gives you a bit of camaraderie
55045 the reason the value of their work is so unrecognized is this is work thats generally been done by women and its work thats been done for free by the family members
55046 now we have home care workers that are going out in to the community and theyre saving the health care system a tremendous amount of money yet the value of that is really unrecognized
55047 i think the problem with it all is this really affects the workers and the relationships the unions have with each other
55048 we should have some 60 to 70 vehicles in the show which is a premiere event for western newfoundland and takes place right on main street in stephenville which is blocked off for the duration of the show from its intersection with queen street and grove street
55049 for us its a good opportunity to get the message out there
55050 we are seeing an increase in the number of complaints
55051 so we want to get as much information out to people as possible
55052 we basically just go into a business and try to speak to a manager
55053 we try to get five minutes of their time to talk to them about a few issues
55054 its fun to go into the odd business and they look nervous

55066 we were having problems with the transformer that provides power to the wiltondale substation

55128 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
55129 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
55130 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
55131 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
55132 improper functioning of the delta subunit could impair the gaba systems ability to adapt to hormone fluctuations during the highly vulnerable post partum period

55147 caringbridge is a great resource that can help ease the stress on a patients family by allowing them to simply post updates rather than having to make repeated calls to several different people
55148 we anticipate that many people will take advantage of this convenient new service
55149 what motorbike and four wheel drive users have to remember is that the wylie bay sand dunes are chartered as a public use area and therefore regulations under the road traffic act apply to use of that area
55150 with that in mind users can be charged with offences such as dangerous driving
55151 the fact theyre not on a road is immaterial they still have an obligation to act responsibly when using that area
55152 the lemc has a funding agreement with the bhp ravensthorpe nickel operation and they have given us an in principle funding approval for the vehicle
55153 esperance police along with both dec rangers and esperance shire rangers will be increasing our visibility in that area
55154 we will be working with the shire and the lemc to increase signage and education of users and the users have to remember they also have a responsibility to themselves and to other users
55155 there was significant interest from local farmers and i think no matter what the circumstances were on their farms they could take something from the sessions
55156 one of the major things we talked about was containment feeding for stock basically to take pressure off pastures not only in dry seasons like the one we are having now but also in the breaks between good seasons
55157 we also put an emphasis on making the most of straw left over from the harvest baling that up to use as feed rather than simply burning it
55158 small measures like that can make all the difference in the long run
55159 in the last two weeks there have been some decent falls around grass patch and theyve helped fill up the dams
55160 they could certainly do with more but what weve had for the moment has been good
55161 the falls to the east havent quite been as good they were focused a bit more on the coast around thomas river but most farms have had enough rain to re seed so thats definitely a positive
55162 we have done a couple of extraditions before but they are not that common
55163 obviously we would like to thank the tennant creek police and alice springs police for their cooperation in this matter
55164 i know they are running programs like this in broome also further up north and in the eastern states
55165 there is a concern that we have seen a rise in young men from the ages of 35 to 50 with alcohol induced dementia who arent able to properly care for themselves
55166 i think there is definitely a demand for this service in esperance chris meyers esperance care services manager deals on a daily basis with not only homeless people but also people who for whatever reason dont have money for food and even two nights a week is going to really help these people
55167 we will see how it goes and see what feedback we get but i would eventually like it to be more than a soup kitchen
55168 if we can turn it into a base where homeless people can have a shower get some fresh clothes and also leave their things during the day i think that would be great just as a place where they can feel safe
55169 far too often we see people who have been in a stable environment like graylands hospital shipped back to esperance on the bus without adequate support
55170 for these people accommodation and food is a major issue so further to that we are in the planning stages of setting up some transitional and support accommodation in esperance for people with mental illness
55171 this is an issue i am very passionate about depending on funding i would hope we could get that accommodation set up within 12 months
55172 if we can use this as a base we can really improve the facilities that are available to people in need locally

55174 why the latest istanbul attacks were so pernicious m mehdi ilhan 1 08 2008 9 34 00 am creating terror in a country such as turkey with more than 70 million people and particularly in a city the size of istanbul will plunge the country not just into dismay but rather into chaos the attacks in gungoren a suburb of istanbul last sunday killed 17 and wounded 150 innocent civilians these attacks were designed to create chaos and intimidate the government so far no terrorist organisation has claimed responsibility if any group does the whole web of terrorist organisations will have to shoulder the responsibility because in turkey they are all interwoven as the recent arrests indicate

55192 i thought we had grown up as a society not even brothels would be this brazen to promote their services

55197 the best explanation for how the newborn universe went through a period of ultrafast expansion has been under increasing scrutiny recently after researchers found irregularities in the cosmic microwave background the radiation left over from the big bang that appeared to contradict some of the predictions of the simplest version of the model

55229 today one of the most powerful religions in the western world is environmentalism environmentalism seems to be the religion of choice for urban atheists why do i say its a religion well just look at the beliefs if you look carefully you see that environmentalism is in fact a perfect 21st century remapping of traditional judeo christian beliefs and myths theres an initial eden a paradise a state of grace and unity with nature theres a fall from grace into a state of pollution as a result of eating from the tree of knowledge and as a result of our actions there is a judgment day coming for us all we are all energy sinners doomed to die unless we seek salvation which is now called sustainability sustainability is salvation in the church of the environment just as organic food is its communion that pesticide free wafer that the right people with the right beliefs imbibe eden the fall of man the loss of grace the coming doomsday these are deeply held mythic structures they are profoundly conservative beliefs they may even be hard wired in the brain for all i know i certainly dont want to talk anybody out of them as i dont want to talk anybody out of a belief that jesus christ is the son of god who rose from the dead but the reason i dont want to talk anybody out of these beliefs is that i know that i cant talk anybody out of them these are not facts that can be argued these are issues of faith and so it is sadly with environmentalism increasingly it seems facts arent necessary because the tenets of environmentalism are all about belief its about whether you are going to be a sinner or saved whether you are going to be one of the people on the side of salvation or on the side of doom whether you are going to be one of us or one of them am i exaggerating to make a point i am afraid not because we know a lot more about the world than we did forty or fifty years ago and what we know now is not so supportive of certain core environmental myths yet the myths do not die lets examine some of those beliefs there is no eden there never was what was that eden of the wonderful mythic past is it the time when infant mortality was 80 when four children in five died of disease before the age of five when one woman in six died in childbirth when the average lifespan was 40 as it was in america a century ago when plagues swept across the planet killing millions in a stroke was it when millions starved to death is that when it was eden and what about indigenous peoples living in a state of harmony with the eden like environment well they never did on this continent the newly arrived people who crossed the land bridge almost immediately set about wiping out hundreds of species of large animals and they did this several thousand years before the white man showed up to accelerate the process and what was the condition of life loving peaceful harmonious hardly the early peoples of the new world lived in a state of constant warfare generations of hatred tribal hatreds constant battles the warlike tribes of this continent are famous the comanche sioux apache mohawk aztecs toltec incas some of them practiced infanticide and human sacrifice and those tribes that were not fiercely warlike were exterminated or learned to build their villages high in the cliffs to attain some measure of safety how about the human condition in the rest of the world the maori of new zealand committed massacres regularly the dyaks of borneo were headhunters the polynesians living in an environment as close to paradise as one can imagine fought constantly and created a society so hideously restrictive that you could lose your life if you stepped in the footprint of a chief it was the polynesians who gave us the very concept of taboo as well as the word itself the noble savage is a fantasy and it was never true that anyone still believes it 200 years after rousseau shows the tenacity of religious myths their ability to hang on in the face of centuries of factual contradiction
55230 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
55231 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
55232 if someone has used nearly all the windows operating systems why would he ever switch
55233 no 5 is still the worlds most popular scent because like the chanel jacket it radiates sophistication
55234 its soft and warm like an oriental fragrance but has crisp clean notes so its sexy but not overwhelming
55235 candyfloss devoid of chic reference holiday from propriety and convention
55236 i wanted these guys to get a public building named after them
55237 risked their lives by returning fire assisting victims and directing traffic
55238 the name of this building honors all who were heroes on august 1 1966 many of their names will never be known
55239 the university of texas at austin remembers with profound sorrow the tragedy of august 1 1966 this space is dedicated as the tower garden a memorial to those who died to those who were wounded and to the countless other victims who were immeasurably affected by the tragedy
55240 from what ive learned about the tragedy it had a huge impact on the city and this community
55241 im not surprised people want to recognize the courage and the bravery of people involved in that event
55242 whats were talking about is essentially completing the original vision
55243 they havent lived up to their agreements and now they are coming back and saying we want to rezone it as a pud and in effect they are saying they are breaking their agreement
55244 neighbors need to know when there is an agreement made thats something you can count on
55245 that way they never have to come back and ask for anything else and they can do whatever they want and the neighborhood can never have another say in it
55246 i think though that what this whole thing comes down to is both sides the neighbors that are living in the neighborhood as well as the j being good neighbors to each other
55247 the reality is that if the j really understands their traffic patterns it could be a moot point
55248 if they know all their traffic or a vast majority is exiting going down to far west and down to mopac that ought to be something they would have a good feel for it comes down to credibility its going to have to be a two prong approach the j doing their traffic study and the city coming in and verifying it
55249 we felt more of our patients lived here than on the east side
55250 this is a single family neighborhood and this is going to bring more social problems to our neighborhood
55251 if you truly want to serve these people put it at the center of these health problems
55252 you wouldnt try this tactic in west austin why would you do this in north austin
55253 we havent heard any data driven reason yet to make us think that this is not a good choice
55254 there are many things that need to be done before we would close on the property
55255 they made a little mistake but thats no reason to get mad
55256 but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
55257 given the seriousness of the issues youd think we could have a serious debate
55258 but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i mean i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this election is about is that what is worthy of the american people
55259 even the media has pointed out that senator john mccain who started off talking about running an honorable campaign has fallen back on predictable political attacks and demonstrably false statements
55260 but the time for game playing is over thats why im running for president of the united states of america
55261 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
55262 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
55263 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real
55264 no senator with all due respect back at you global warming is not real
55265 suppose im wrong and theres no such thing as climate change all weve done is give our kids a cleaner planet but suppose im right and we do nothing then what kind of planet do we hand off to our kids and our grandkids
55266 the choice america will face in november is very clear
55267 long held conservative principles of limited government strong national defense and individual freedom
55268 the afghans fought tirelessly among themselves but when a foreign invader threatened they united to drive him out even alexanders hold had been fleeting macedonian mogul persian russian british and soviet armies all tried and failed to control the afghan tribes
55269 more than anything else we need help to rebuild our human capital and our institutions our army our police force our administrative structure our judiciary and so on
55270 it is indeed a third way not old left or new right but a new center and center left governing philosophy for the future it seeks to modernize britain but for a purpose to create a one nation britain
55271 theres not a liberal america and a conservative america there is a united states of america
55272 the 20th century killed those ideologies of rigid forms of economic and social theory and their passing causes little regret
55273 rudd just wants to do what every labor politician likes tax industry and redistribute the proceeds at huge cost to the economy
55274 no more left and right wrong as australian voters are now discovering under the post partisan talk is crafty election rhetoric
55275 when the performers arrive theyre in absolute awe of their surroundings and so taken with the setting that they tend to put on great shows
55276 of course it will but i expect to use some of the savings that we realize from the plans i proposed several weeks ago reducing the percentage of education funds spent outside the classroom to fund this initia tive
55277 we spend millions of dollars a year trying to lure new busi nesses to our state it is about time that we realized that if we want to recruit new businesses we can do that best by recruiting excellent new teachers strong schools are the backbone of a strong state economy
55278 is neither sociological commentary nor political criticism thought it may certainly function in these modes through the artists lyrics
55279 something interesting about the hip hop revolution is that like the uprising of the proletariat that marxist predicted it seems to be ever in the future we move ever further into the future in real life but never get any closer to that marvelous time when hip hop becomes a political tool and starts improving lives
55280 ther is no proper name for it that i knowe but that sertayne men of captayne haukinses doth call it a john hawkins had recently returned from his third highly profitable voyage

55362 ive found with the warriors that once we get on a roll were hard to stop and thats what were looking to do again
55363 when you have the opportunity you just have to go with it
55364 its just basically using your head your mind to help your body
55365 you ought to understand who was isaac who rebecca and concerning what persons he declared that this people should be greater than that
55366 and he brought manasseh and ephraim desiring that manasseh should be blessed because he was the elder

55381 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
55382 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
55383 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
55384 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
55385 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
55386 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living
55387 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
55388 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
55389 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
55390 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns

55392 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
55393 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
55394 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
55395 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products

55431 this unfounded assertion of executive privilege does not protect a principle it protects a person
55432 the president is wrong to shield vice president cheney from scrutiny
55433 well he was a major player in the conservative movement and the way i think of tony is hes unique in terms of the extent to which he knew the news side of the business then as a commentator and but also somebody who worked as part of the white house staff as a speechwriter and of course as press secretary and there are very very few people that have had as much experience on both sides of the divide if you will
55434 he had this rare combination of intelligence of commitment and loyalty to the president that he was working for
55435 but also this great love of going out behind that podium and doing battle with what in effect were his former colleagues
55436 i always remember the night he came to a dinner party at our house
55437 and the house had burned down that day theyd just had a significant house fire and with tony you know he would tell you that happened but it absolutely didnt affect his enjoyment of the evening or his outlook on life a lot of us would you know really be bummed out if we just had a major house fire and he had this capacity to sort of put everything in its place maintain his perspective and i think hed want us to do that now i think he lived his life to the fullest

55442 the exchanges between cheneys office and rices people at state got very testy but ultimately condi had the presidents ear and persuaded him that his legacy would be stronger if they reached a deal with pyongyang

55446 they said the vice president would like a copy of this film
55447 why should the taxpayers bear any burden for rick goddards campaign

55449 i remember many occasions when we did the show when he would ask me about my health
55450 but he never commented on his own i was unaware that he had coronary artery disease we could have compared notes
55451 the president and the national security team were meeting all weekend up at camp david planning our response to 9 11 and tim came up there and we did the show from a facility right next door and it was a remarkable moment in american history there was this tremendous sense obviously that something enormously significant had happened on 9 11 and of course we had lost 3 000 americans that morning to the worst terrorist attack in our history and tim captured on the show and the way he handled it captured the feeling and the emotion of the moment but he also gave us a great opportunity to get into the substance of the kind of response that was being considered analysis of who had done it we went back and reminisced to some extent about what had actually happened on the morning of 9 11 so it was it was a remarkable moment in my career but a lot of that was due to tim and the way he handled the show

55454 today were in a situation where were supposed to go out and scream and yell at the folks who are producing and try to get them to produce more while we arent working to produce all that we have here at home ourselves
55455 its my own view that we should be drilling in anwr in an environmentally responsible way which could increase our daily domestic oil production by as much as a million barrels a day
55456 yet congress has said no to drilling in anwr no to drilling off the east coast no to drilling off the west coast no to drilling off florida given the high prices americans are now paying we should hear no more complaining from politicians whove stood in the way of increasing energy production inside this country they are part of the problem
55457 here too the question is a practical and urgent one
55458 the problem with getting this agreement passed is that the house democratic leadership has refused to bring it to a vote
55459 in a time when even nafta is being called into doubt candidates can draw cheers by denouncing trade deals with our next door neighbors protectionism is the refuge of a tired fearful nation
55460 on capitol hill many have ignored the obvious and stood in the way of more domestic energy production
55461 oil is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of florida but were not doing it the chinese are in cooperation with the cuban government even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply
55462 the way it actually worked was they talked to me about whether or not i was interested in the vice presidents job originally and i said no definitely not interested
55463 and then they came back and said would you help us find somebody
55464 sure id be happy to do that we got through doing the search
55465 it took a couple of months and at the end of the day the president after we reviewed all the candidates looked at me and said you know youre the solution to my problem i took that as a threat and redoubled my efforts but its been well worth the efforts
55466 he persuaded me that what he wanted and what he needed in a vice president that i fit the bill so i was willing to give up private life which i was enjoying at that point and join in
55467 i dont regret it for a minute its been a tremendous experience hes been absolutely true to his word in terms of letting me get actively involved in the whole range of activities and its been well worth the effort
55468 you know if you graduate from yale with a c average you can be president of the united states if you get kicked out you can be vice president
55469 that a man who has ascended to the seat of vice president of the united states would openly display such contempt and astounding ignorance toward his own countrymen is an insult to all americans now that he or the administration he represents no longer needs their vote mr cheney apparently feels that he is now free to mock and belittle the people of west virginia
55470 might buy a little bit of relief but its minimal
55471 i think its a false notion in the sense that youre not going to have much of an impact given the size of the gasoline tax on the total cost of the gallon of gas
55472 ive never written a book and i always said that i got this job because i didnt write about the last one but well see
55473 remind your friends that whenever they hear democratic politicians pledging to get rid of the bush tax cuts what theyre promising is a major tax hike for working families and they wouldnt have to move a muscle to do it because under the law that tax cuts simply expire a few years from now
55474 part of the problem in washington is that a lot of our democratic friends year after year have tried to stand in the way of more energy production the plain truth is we can get a lot more energy here in america and we can do it in an environmentally sound and friendly way
55475 senator joe lieberman of connecticut is a statesman whose democratic credentials could not be more impeccable applause after all he ran against me for vice president in 2000 laughter yet in his most recent campaign joe was targeted for political extinction by his fellow democrats one by one they turned their backs on him joes old running mate al gore abandoned him his connecticut colleague and best friend in the senate chris dodd campaigned against him in a tough political fight joe lieberman was dropped by his own party simply because of his firm stand in the war on terror a stand he has consistently held in good times and bad
55476 a reception like that almost makes me want to run for office again
55477 president bush and i look forward to helping our candidates up and down the ticket throughout this very important election year and the stakes are high whether the issue is the economy or energy or the federal courts or national security the right answers are coming not from the democrats but from the republicans
55478 you and i belong with the party of limited taxes limited government and free enterprise we understand that government exists not to be the peoples master but rather their servant applause we understand the constitution and the separation of powers and that is why we believe in putting good judges on the bench like john roberts and sam alito applause above all ladies and gentlemen we believe in protecting the united states of america defending our security our values and our way of life
55479 going more than six and a half years without another 9 11 is no accident its an achievement
55480 this election year poses one fundamental question on national security who is serious about fighting and winning the war on terror on every front and the choice is going to be very clear on one side is the democratic party led by the likes of senator harry reid who said more than a year ago that the war is lost a democratic party whose leaders in congress permitted a vital surveillance law to expire leaving the united states more vulnerable to terrorist attack a democratic party that operates in tandem with moveon org a fringe group that ran a full page ad in the new york times attacking the character and the courage of general dave petraeus a democratic party that has in joe liebermans word kowtowed to the opinions of the far left rather than challenging them
55481 we stopped at the threshold to the oval and i can still picture the green rug the heavy gold braid flags and the tall leather chair of lyndon baines johnson off to the side was a big cabinet with terminals for the associated press and united press international so the president could read the news as it came off the wires also there was a long wooden console with three tv sets so that he could watch all of the networks simultaneously things are different now of course laughter with the internet and all the cable outlets these days in the west wing you can watch more than 60 different channels i wonder where president johnson would find room for that many tvs laughter im sure i had many thoughts while i was standing there in that doorway back in 1968 but i was incapable of imagining that time and chance would bring me back into the west wing so often over the decades whether as a bottom rung staff aide chief of staff cabinet member congressman or vice president taken together experiences like these give you a deep appreciation for the duties and the pressures of the presidency a taste of both victory and defeat a valuable sense of perspective when the road gets rough and an understanding that personal character is a decisive factor in any presidency
55482 the chief of staff is there for all the high profile activities from flights on air force one to summit meetings to state dinners but hes also there at all hours of the day for the less pleasant work putting out the fires resolving turf battles managing crises delivering bad news its a job that takes every ounce of your mental and physical energy in my case i worked too hard slept too little smoked too many cigarettes laughter but its also a job i loved due mainly to the tremendous respect and affection i had for the president i served gerald r ford
55483 gerald ford once said as president my primary concern must always be the greatest good of all the people of the united states whose servant i am as a man my first consideration is to be true to my own conscience and my own convictions to me those words remain a superb and timeless standard of presidential responsibility i have witnessed it often and at close quarters and i saw it first in president gerald r ford i miss my friend and im certain i wouldnt be vice president today had it not been for the opportunities he gave me all those years ago
55484 he was subjected to sleep deprivation for a period of 70 days by means of prolonged interrogations strobe lights threatening music forced intake of water and forced standing
55485 two female interrogators touched him sexually and made sexual statements to him
55486 hey did you really sell a shipment of enriched uranium to iran nah i didnt think youd do that but you know just had to ask
55487 i am very pleased with my visit to washington in all of my meetings there was great interest in the kurdistan region and appreciation for what we have accomplished our relationship with the united states has never been better
55488 everyone is paying more these days to fill up the gas tank to put food on the table
55489 before long i believe the tax rebates now underway will help strengthen the case for permanent tax relief were giving the american economy a shot of energy at the right time and in the right way and in the months to come the american people will once again prove why our economy remains the envy of the world
55490 the united states and israel have persevered through many difficulties and the tests of history have found us ready
55491 as fellow democracies we cherish a friendship based on shared principles a shared commitment to the safety of our peoples and a deep willingness to labor intensively in the cause of security and lasting peace
55492 what started as a tiny struggling country is still tiny but has seen six decades of unceasing accomplishment the desert has bloomed and israel has become a nation of world class enterprises great universities and medical centers technological advancement scholarly brilliance and cultural beauty holocaust survivors and refugees have been welcomed from europe the arab lands ethiopia the former soviet union and they have found hope and opportunity in the land of jacob
55493 president bush is on his way to texas for his daughters wedding this weekend so you can bet hell be writing a few checks too
55494 cheney was ceo of halliburton during the time of his liaisons with the pamela martin amp associates escort firm palfreys phone invoices extend back to 1996 and include calls to and from cheney
55495 this will certainly go to the gop and the white house
55496 the vice president intends on working hard this cycle to return a republican majority to congress
55497 right now with the economy going through a rough patch some in washington view it as an excuse to expand the size and scope of the federal government
55498 republicans believe when americans are facing tough times the first thing we should do is let them keep more of their own money
55499 the problem in washington is that a lot of our democratic friends year after year have tried to stand in the way of increased energy production
55500 the obstructionists obviously have prevailed so today were no closer to anwr production than we were 10 or 20 years ago
55501 the american people are paying the price for that inaction every time they fill up their gas tanks
55502 congress lacks the constitutional power to regulate by law what a vice president communicates in the performance of the vice presidents official duties or what a vice president recommends that a president communicate
55503 those citizens who say that have never heard my sermons nor do they know me
55504 i served six years in the military does that make me patriotic how many years did vice president dick cheney serve
55505 i thought some of the things he said were absolutely appalling and you know i havent gotten into the business of trying to judge how sen obama dealt with it or didnt deal with it but i really i think like most americans i was stunned at what the reverend was preaching in his church and then putting up on his web site
55506 in the field of international relations the house democratic leadership is trying to derail a free trade agreement with colombia thats been in the work for many years so theres a good base of support for the agreement in both houses of congress the problem is the house leadership is refusing to bring it to a vote and has even changed the rules to keep it off the floor if they persist in unfair action the result will be a tremendous setback for one of our closest allies in latin america severe damage to our nations credibility in the region and a boost of confidence for demagogues who want to subvert democratic values in our own hemisphere in both of these cases both with respect to surveillance of the enemy and the colombian free trade agreement congress has resorted to gimmicks from meaningless expiration dates to last minute switches in the rules with these tactics they only undermine the american peoples confidence in the legislative branch of government but i didnt come here today to dwell on the current shortcomings of congress
55507 theres been much discussion about the events in basra and much of it misses the point
55508 this was an iraqi initiative for their security forces loyal to the government to take back a city that had become overrun by extremists and thugs and this is exactly the kind of initiative we seek from iraqs leaders in general iraqs security forces accomplished their mission and have taken back most of the city this show of strength by iraqs democratically elected government against an iranian backed militia has inspired a new unity of purpose among iraqs political leaders shia sunni and kurd alike
55509 as general petraeus has put it the achievements thus far have been fragile and they are reversible
55510 so its necessary first of all that we keep sufficient troop levels on the ground in iraq the plan is to withdraw all the five surge brigades by the end of july by then well be back to the pre surge levels of 15 combat brigades at that point general petraeus and the command staff will make a full and candid assessment and give further recommendations on future troop levels to the president by now all americans know exactly how the president will make that decision he will not look at the polls listen to the pundits or read the editorial pages he will look at all the facts and then hell do whats right for the united states for our long term security and for the cause of peace and freedom in iraq
55511 as much as a nation of influence were also a nation of character and that sets us apart from so many other great powers in history from ancient empires to the expansionist regimes of the last century were a superpower that has moral commitments and ideals that we not only proclaim but that we act upon today in a tough fight we are turning events toward victory and the world will be a better place because of what the united states of america did
55512 mr gates and mr cheney made some comments about military choice according to the problems that the americans face and their disastrous situation in iraq and afghanistan and their interior problems we think it would be unlikely the americans would take the decision to get themselves into a new fiasco the consequences of which they themselves have acknowledged would be painful for the region and the world
55513 im sorry my wife lynne couldnt be with us today
55514 she had something she had to do she had a speech last night in new york so ill meet her when i get back to washington she lots of times comes down on these trips with me and we still enjoy campaigning together after all these years but i tell people i like to tell people that we have a republican marriage that in 1952 when dwight eisenhower ran for congress i was living in lincoln nebraska with my folks anybody here from lincoln laughter youre making it up laughter and we dad worked for the solar conservation service department of agriculture and after eisenhower got elected he reorganized the agriculture department dad got transferred to casper wyoming and thats where i met lynne we grew up together went to high school together and in august well celebrate our 44th wedding anniversary and we explained to a group of people the other night that if it hadnt been for that victory by dwight eisenhower in 1952 i would never have moved to wyoming and lynne would have married somebody else laughter and she said right and now hed be vice president of the united states laughter and applause no doubt in my mind
55515 you know jeff well here in the first district youve sent him to washington four times and hes repaid your confidence and trust every single day hes been there hes a common sense conservative a good steward of the taxpayer dollar a hard worker for the people of the region he represents
55516 i cant think of a stronger advocate for veterans or a more reliable supporter of our military in these challenging times your congressman is the kind of man who belongs in the house of representatives and come november i know youll give jeff another term on capitol hill
55517 when you hear politicians saying they want to get rid of the bush tax cuts what theyre promising is a major tax hike for everybody including working families and they wouldnt have to move a muscle to do it because under the law the tax cuts those rates we put in place in 03 will simply expire so without passing legislation those rates will kick back in the old high rates and automatically there will be a tax increase across the board
55518 one of the ways weve prevented attacks and saved lives is by monitoring terrorist related communications last year congress passed major revisions to the foreign intelligence surveillance law the fisa but those revisions have now expired and so weve lost an important means for protecting the american people for congress to let that happen was simply irresponsible and it makes the nation more vulnerable to attack
55519 there is no way to maintain the frontiers of freedom without cost and commitment and risk
55520 obviously youre not the kind to look down on a bitter man who clings to his guns
55521 i spent the morning with one infallible authority and now i get to spend the evening with a thousand of them
55522 i was glad to talk to the pope its rare that i run into somebody whos heard more secrets than i have
55523 mitt let me give you a little nugget of advice nevermind the resume the policy ideas or any of that other stuff just get yourself on that search committee
55524 it has been a memorable week and pope benedict xvi has stepped into the history of our country in a very special way
55525 some 60 million americans belong to his fold and all of america respects this messenger of peace and justice and freedom
55526 nearly 57 years have passed since the day of your ordination as a priest in june 1951
55527 you might have found it hard to imagine then that you would stand before all of humanity as a teacher as a statement and as a shepherd of more than a billion souls that is what god has called you to do in these 57 years your wisdom and your pastoral gifts have been extraordinary blessings to our world in these six days youve shared those blessings very directly with the people of the united states your presence has honored our country
55528 here in new york you have addressed representatives of many nations and celebrated the eucharist before many thousands and you have moved us by your visit to ground zero
55529 there you prayed for eternal light and peace upon the innocent victims of september 11th 2001 and you asked that the rest of us may live so that all who died on that morning may not have been lost in vain that is our daily meditation as well and it remains our daily prayer
55530 im pleased not only that he has stepped up but that so many others have supported my re election
55531 republicans in new york are in free fall and cheneys visit to new york just proves vito fossellas campaign is flagging
55532 rather than bring home necessary resources to meet the needs of his district vito fossella is embracing dick cheney and his big oil money to resurrect his failing campaign
55533 those who can now say we can afford to turn our backs on iraq are inviting the same kind of outcome that we saw in afghanistan prior to the september 11th terrorist attacks a period of chaos and recrimination a violent power struggle won by a brutal minority and safe haven for terrorists
55534 the difference is now were in the midst of a global war on terror
55535 failure in iraq would have even further more serious and far reaching consequences
55536 the prospect of each and every appointment record immediately becoming the subject of forced public disclosure would surely cast a chill over the ability of the president and vice president to collect information and advice
55537 i just think the single most important issue were faced with in this election is the future of the republic national security global war on terror et cetera the vice president continued
55538 and ive had my differences with john over the years but i think hes the right man for the job at this time
55539 and i think hes head and shoulders above a man like sen obama in terms of his experience and his ability to make these decisions said the vice president who has served four presidents during his own time in washington
55540 theres no question in my mind where the philosophical guidance and the flexibility in order to do so originated in the vice president of the united states office
55541 his implementer in this case was defense secretary donald rumsfeld and the defense department
55542 the vice president had to cover this in order for it to happen and in order for secretary rumsfeld to feel as though he had freedom of action
55543 i can only assume that when the vice president of the united states lobbies the congress on behalf of cruel and unusual punishment and the need to be able to do that in order to get information out of potential terrorists that its still going on
55544 our country is at war and our government has an obligation to protect the american people from a brutal enemy that has declared war upon us we are aggressively finding terrorists and bringing them to justice and anything we do within this effort is within the law
55545 ahmadinejad is i think a very dangerous man on the one hand he has repeatedly stated that he wants to destroy israel he also has is a man who believes in the return of the 12th imam and that the highest honor that can befall a man is that he should die a martyr in facilitating the return of the 12th imam its a radical radical point of view bernard lewis once said mutual assured destruction in the soviet u s relationship in the cold war meant deterrence but mutual assured destruction with ahmadinejad is an incentive you have to be concerned about that
55546 no legitimate interest is served when oil and gas become tools of intimidation or blackmail either by supply manipulation or attempts to monopolize transportation and no one can justify actions that undermine the territorial integrity of a neighbor or interfere with democratic movements
55547 the energy sources that russia possesses must be used for our own people not to help development of democracies in neighboring countries
55548 when vice president dick cheney visited lexington monday he received a kentucky breakfast at the home of kelly and judd knight
55549 the technology to manufacture chemical weapons is simply too ubiquitous covert chemical warfare programs too easily concealed and the international communitys record of responding effectively to violations of arms control treaties too unsatisfactory to permit confidence that such a regime would actually reduce the chemical threat
55550 be careful watch out for drunk drivers dont set your drink down at the bar dont speed dont talk to strangers and look out for suspicious men
55551 we as a ministry must be prepared for the possibility our strategic facilities will be hit we have to be ready for the worst case scenario but nevertheless this drill is a test of readiness for us and should not be perceived as a threat to any of our neighbors
55552 an iranian strike on israel will lead to an israeli response that will devastate the iranian nation
55553 unfortunately after every visit of senior american officials in the region and the occupied territories we witness similar actions by the zionist regime
55554 dick cheney home from a 10 day tour that ranged from iraq and afghanistan to turkey and saudi arabia is not your regular road warrior
55555 so writes deb reichmann of the associated press who accompanied the vice president who travels with a green duffel bag stuffed with nonfiction books about military campaigns and political affairs an ipod and noise canceling earphones to listen to oldies and some country western
55556 quite remarkable progress in the areas of development and prosperity
55557 terror and rockets do not merely kill innocent civilians they also kill the legitimate hopes and aspirations of the palestinian people
55558 a negotiated end to the israeli palestinian conflict one that addresses the legitimate national claims of both peoples would have limitless value years of mistrust and violence have achieved nothing and the extremists who have stood in the way of a settlement have only caused further grief and suffering for the palestinian and israeli peoples
55559 i am reiterating the presidents commitment to his vision of two democratic states israel and palestine living side by side in peace and security reaching the necessary agreement will require tough decisions and painful concessions by both sides but america is committed to moving the process forward
55560 peace and security cannot be achieved through settlement expansion or erecting roadblocks around cities and villages or military escalation against gaza or continued incursions into the cities of the west bank or the arrests that have led so far to the presence of more than 11 000 palestinian prisoners incarcerated in israeli jails
55561 we have this problem of the iranians who want to build two satellites the hezbollah and the hamas in gaza nobody can control us and say that declarations by ahmadinejad are less serious
55562 we have to take it seriously irans only intention of developing ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads is to destroy israel and threaten the entire world
55563 theres evidence that hamas is supported by iran and syria and that theyre doing everything they can to torpedo the peace process
55564 hezbollah went through the dustup with the israelis in 06 theyve been completely resupplied by the iranians oftentimes providing materials through the syrians and then flying materials into damascus and then taking them by road into lebanon
55565 theres been a very close relationship over the years obviously between iran and hezbollah i dont think theres any question but what iran and syria have no interest in seeing the peace process succeed thats a conclusion that i arrived at not just on my own but also from talking with people in the region
55566 if every muslim pours out a bucket of water israel drowns
55567 the vice president of the white house gang of terror occupation murders and massacres whose hands are in blood is coming to turkey to seek turkeys cooperation and support against palestine or lebanon against syria and iran
55568 yes johnny the government is in fact all colorful flowers costumed characters and candy
55569 it would be a mistake now to be so eager to draw down the force that we risk putting the outcome in jeopardy and i dont think well do that
55570 i come away with a sense that theres been significant progress in the 10 months since i was last here that weve made progress not only on the security front but that theyve made progress in governing as well
55571 its clear that theres still a number of major issues that need to be addressed that they are focused on as a government you cant help when you come here after youve been here a few times over the years and watched these events unfold and focus on the fact this is the this week marks the fifth anniversary since we launched into iraq in march of 03 all that has transpired not only in the last what 14 or 15 months since the surge decision by the president and gen petraeus arrival with his counterinsurgency strategy its been a remarkable turnaround in the overall security situation and the level of violence both in terms of military and civilian casualties
55572 we have no intention of abandoning our friends or allowing this country of 170 000 sq km to become a staging ground for further attacks against americans all americans can be certain that we intend to complete the mission so that another generation of americans does not have to come back here and do it again
55573 five years ago this week we led a coalition to liberate this country from tyranny its never been easy but we know from history that its worth all the effort we put into it
55574 were helping them fight back because its the right thing to do and because its important for our own long term security
55575 remains a place where freedom does not flourish it will remain a place of stagnation resentment and violence ready for export
55576 theres just not a lot out there and some of that excess capacity represents high sulphur crude for example its not very attractive and not easily marketed you look at all of that and you look at the much closer balance if you will between supply and demand as well as the declining value of the dollar youve got a situation in which weve seen the price of oil rise fairly dramatically in recent months but it reflects primarily the realities in the marketplace
55577 remind them of their obligations under the road map peace plan
55578 i know saxby is going to win another term this november
55579 saxby of course is a very courageous man i know that because hes one of my hunting buddies
55580 as vice president the only real duties you have under the constitution is to preside over the senate and to cast tie breaking votes
55581 in fact before the constitution was written some believed the vice presidency was entirely unnecessary benjamin franklin said that if the office were to be created anyone who served as vice president should be addressed as your superfluous excellency thats a lot better than some of the things ive been called
55582 fighting against enemies who are determined to inflict great harm on this country
55583 its one of my earliest memories so i wasnt very old obviously at the time the vice president told a crowd of 5 000 sailors
55584 i had a lot of questions for him where had he been
55585 being only four years old i concluded that when dad was home he was just dad but when he went back to the navy he turned into some kind of bird you see very early in life i decided the united states navy could do just about anything
55586 i think any day you can talk to the second most powerful person in the world about your community is a good day
55587 vice president cheney energized people and let them know how important the race is its getting a lot of attention
55588 any time you have a sitting vice president campaigning for you it draws attention and builds excitement
55589 i dont see the vice presidents visit being any kind of last ditch effort or going to extraordinary measures to win
55590 soldiers experienced skin abscesses cellulitis skin infections diarrhea and other illnesses after using discolored smelly water for personal hygiene and laundry at five u s military sites in iraq
55591 supplied by the military and a contractor once owned by vice president dick cheneys former company
55592 was not speaking for me and for the rest of the people in this country when he called for an immediate pullout of american troops from iraq wars dont end they are won or lost
55593 its a great privilege to serve the people of the country in a position first occupied by john adams president bush and i have now begun our final year in office and were not going to waste a moment of it applause were going to take wise and careful steps to revitalize americas economy in a moment of challenge and well press on in the fight against enemies who are determined to inflict great harm on this country
55594 the absence of another 9 11 is not an accident it is an achievement
55595 when the last chapter is written itll be said that our nation became more prosperous and more secure because george w bush was president of these united states
55596 as courts have recognized using digital technology a video recording can easily be cut and spliced so as to embarrass and even humiliate a witness
55597 because the whole thing would probably be kind of funny cheney might even come out looking good if the vice president didnt insist on making everything so creepy
55598 we have a wonderful quail crop and hes a fabulous shot
55599 a welcome like that is almost enough to make me want to run for office again almost
55600 youve got an impressive lineup of speakers over the next few days among these are some fine citizens now running for office including im certain the next president of the united states
55601 questioned at a time when another attack on this country was believed to be imminent
55602 its a good thing we had him in custody and its a good thing we found out what we knew
55603 we are delighted that conservatives will have the opportunity to welcome both president bush and vice president cheney this year it will be a great opportunity for thousands of conservatives particularly the large number of students from across the country who attend to hear from the president in person and evaluate the accomplishments of his administration
55604 not so average think out of the box type company
55605 hes talking about hope again hes so idealistic and naive hes a hopemonger
55606 the surge isnt working weve reduced the violence but those damn iraqis just wont get their damn government together
55607 we have an urban core that is expanding and it has pierced through 277 into south end elizabeth midtown wesley heights and wilmore
55608 why did you leave buffalo and why did you come back
55609 i disagree with the nervousness about the buffalo job market
55610 if youre not happy you dont get to complain about it unless you are willing to do something to change your circumstances
55611 good things are happening move here we need more bodies
55612 there are zombies down there in case you havent noticed
55613 we dont have a phone were totally surrounded and there are zombies all over the lower level
55614 i guess we should go practice martial arts on the beach and prepare for the worst
55615 where there was a detailed discussion of this topic in the comments section for those who did not read through it i suggest a quick perusal of dimons comments my post and the discussion in the comments from the wsj com
55616 it has huge implications for the municipal bond market and for banks that may have to take another round of writedowns its just a mess
55617 american express said second quarter net income came in at 653 million or 56 cents a share vs 1 06 billion or 88 cents a share the same period a year earlier the latest results include 600 million that the company added to reserves to cover bad loans in the u s the company said there was also one other 136 million charge and a tax benefit of 101 million american express was expected to make 83 cents a share according to the average estimate of 16 analysts in a thomson reuters survey
55618 the second quarter results included a 600 million 374 million after tax addition to u s lending credit reserves that reflects a deterioration of credit indicators beyond our prior expectation and a 136 million 85 million after tax charge to the fair market value of the companys retained interest in securitized cardmember loans
55619 slim majority in state backs oil drilling off the coast

55638 fundamental contradiction between the rhetoric of the naval theatre and the reality of international affairs
55639 the primacy at land and at sea was beyond the resources of even such a great and diligent people as the germans

55642 as the logical continuation of the hanses attempt at establishing germany as a major sea power
55643 projection of military values and army tradition on to the navy

55890 provides a means to describe the structure of text based information in a document
55891 a family of current and future document types and modules that reproduce subset and extend html 4
55892 the need for a reformulated version of html was felt primarily because world wide web content now needs to be delivered to many devices like mobile devices apart from traditional desktop computers where extra resources cannot be devoted to support the additional complexity of html syntax
55893 making your web site section 508 or wai wcag compliant is a major part of any commercial project target was recently sued because their site wasnt section 508 or wai wcag compliant

55895 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority
55896 our main reason for doing this is were trying to cut down on the black population
55897 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
55898 i dont mind being punished for something i did not for something i didnt do
55899 there was no weapon present and no danger to the public
55900 it was preparing to turn and it appears the wheels got off the edge of the roadway
55901 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
55902 to see if anything could be done to facilitate our request
55903 took another look and decided that because this group had a parade 25 years ago this would not be a new parade and could be grandfathered in
55904 devoted to educating the public about the struggle to achieve american liberty
55905 your life views make a lot of sense to me

55911 well gwen i suppose id want to live in toronto
55912 me i suppose somewhere with a coast to an ocean any ocean im not picky and little to no city would be preferred some place with a pub not a bar because yes there is a difference and green not like the black and neon of a city but green like open spaces
55913 doubly suitable answer now what were you doin up there
55914 yeah so he calls me this morning to tell me hes getting remarried and needs me to give my mother the divorce papers needless to say she was a mess when i told her i mean this woman has spent the last couple years vying on the fact that if they remained married it meant hed come back maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but hed come back when he left she was a wreck and i hadnt seen her this bad since then
55915 yeah well things with my mom got really bad worse than her just going off her rocker when he first left she started using
55916 cocaine mostly but then it turned to anything that gets her high as a matter of fact i cant remember the last time i saw my mother sober
55917 if it were only that easy i tried to when i turned eighteen you know its not like i didnt try but things got hard she started coming to me for money and stuff i saw her in a bad place and i thought if i moved in with her she just might i dont know stop for my sake you know
55918 do you think your being funny it didnt work out as a matter of fact im pretty sure that was her dealer i saw walking in on my way up here wonder what theyre doing right about now
55919 look it sucks it does honestly yours is by far one the saddest stories ive ever heard is that what you want to hear by no means is it worth your life i mean think about it how many people out there right now are starving because they havent got food in their kitchens or for that matter they dont even have kitchens i mean come on you spout out all of this stupidity over that fact that mummy and daddy arent together anymore boo fuckin hoo my father walked out on my mum when i was just a bun in the oven ive never even met the man and dont think i dont notice when shes been crying over his picture at night or starts drinking cause she cant take the fact that he had somethin so much better to do than raise his own son
55920 im moving out i decided that if i couldnt go through with well with
55921 yeah aside from i told her tonight and she flipped she started screaming and we got into this really big fight she said she was kicking me out so it didnt matter anyway i mean she started to cry and then her phone rang and guess who
55922 ding ding ding we have winner i just went for a walk at first i got down the street and turned around i thought i knew what i wanted you know i thought i was happy but shes my anchor she holds me down i just i couldnt see it before
55923 yeah to be honest i had been looking at places anyway and there is a good amount a few blocks from here and i figure i wont go too far just in case
55924 well it sounds like you have got everything figured out my dear
55925 if not i have a pretty good idea of where it is im going what about you i mean how long are you in town
55926 but im moving here after that just going back to say goodbye to me mum and all pack the last of my stuff
55927 yeah you know me and my friends were going to this pub your 21 right
55928 well youre welcome to join us you know if you dont want to go back in there
55929 yeah but do you mind if i bum a cigarette first
55930 oh right well im on the twelfth floor so lemme go get one
55931 you are so much more indian than all these girls here i like it
55932 drop the lemon into the iced tea so it looks like beer
55933 hey dad how come when we eat inside mom does all the cooking and when we eat outside you do the cooking
55934 well you know son they say a womans place is in the home and if shes inside i guess she might as well be in the kitchen besides us men are better at rugged outdoor activities
55935 we never opened the box we have nothing to do with this box
55936 your children got no business going to the street for love theres no love out there
55937 all thats out there is lost young men looking for love
55938 i heard enough of it to know it was extremely exculpatory
55939 lets see if you can subpoena him to be here for a hearing on the 25th
55940 were going to see what we can do about the mysterious mr mikell
55941 i think it would help everybody because mcclinton is one of the main witnesses against o j
55942 it is not to be released or discussed with anyone
55943 every conflict at some stage has to end up at the negotiating table and it is our assessment that the moment for negotiations is now
55944 whatever arrangements are made about positions and allocations it has to consider the will of the people
55945 what we as leaders should do to resolve that crisis
55946 when you meet for the first after 10 years there is always a tendency of feeling this one has got horns this one has spears and all that
55947 but im sure that you cant have one and a half hours of dinner shouting at each other
55948 as i told the senator he can do more in six years that any of his opponents can do in 20
55949 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state
55950 he has done that over and over and over again whatever these charges are he deserves the respect and our admiration we should wait to see what actually happens before theres a call to do anything
55951 hes brought projects to the state hes put our people to work hes protected the labor agreements
55952 its hard to fathom or believe that a guy whos given his life to public service would jeopardize that for a viking stove and a good deal on a car and rebuilding his house
55953 think of all the thousands of families whose lives suddenly got better most folks in the lower 48 have no concept of that that seems like old news to them

55960 the situation has become critical and threatens the safety and security of the nation and its residents
55961 we are deeply disturbed by this imminent loss of communications service to vital public safety agencies
55962 in just a few days the navajo nation will lose its entire communications network including its public safety network as a byproduct of usacs mishandling of this matter
55963 sadly mothers are also no longer able to reach out and communicate with their children at war in iraq
55964 an internal navajo nation audit conducted during the summer of 2007 found problems with the contract between navajo nation and onsat and the bidding process that led to it
55965 the navajo nation is a place where you often can only get satellite connections and that is very expensive
55966 very little of that has been proven to be wasted it is a very complicated system so lots of schools are just unable to do the applications correctly
55967 if you have a life threatening situation with a student you might not be able to call 911
55968 for people who dont have a phone line or wireless which is a large number of people around here the nearest place to access the internet is probably page ariz which is about 60 miles away
55969 i think with the price of gas going up more people have been asking about the internet
55970 they didnt notice not having it but then they relied on it
55971 it became a real issue when it got switched off people were really upset there isnt really anywhere else around here for a lot of people to get online
55972 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
55973 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
55974 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
55975 it just feels so much safer than i ever thought it would
55976 we dont really go out anymore looking to go and fight the enemy things are stabilized so now were working more on helping the economy and getting people on their feet
55977 the fires of kirkuk will eat all iraqs cities and even the americans
55978 my soldiers ask me that every day i heard a rumor theyre reducing our deployment is it true
55979 when we used to walk the streets in april they were empty and we would be destroying buildings used by enemy positions
55980 now we walk the same streets that were covered in sewage and rubble and utter destruction and they are vibrant and full of people
55981 as the situation improves it feels more like the race is almost finished
55982 compared to youre in the middle of the race and you have a long way to go
55983 i knew it was safer but i refused to believe it i still had the same image of trash filled streets and decaying buildings when we drove through the city that first night i was in shock
55984 we are still in a country where there are people who wish us harm so i cant say i feel completely safe
55985 i was singing 9 to 5 and i choked and forgot the words in front of the president and in front of dolly parton whos like the president to me
55986 so many people want to bring me down and i cant wait to prove them wrong if they believe what they read about me they automatically persecute and torment me
55987 thats ludicrous he just wants me to be happy our whole family gets beaten but that just brings us closer so people are really doing themselves a disservice
55988 i was going through a lot of pain i didnt try anything to change my life other than dating different types of guys and conforming to their worlds i thought i had to be artsier more intellectual
55989 john believed in the jessica simpson thats within he cherished our love he helped make me t he woman i am today john is going to be an amazing man for someone but i know that i was supposed to be with someone else
55990 i had to record that theres nothing on my album that youre gonna hear that i dont relate to or that i havent experienced because the only way i know how to sing is from life experience i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in away that i would tell people to take their heart and run
55991 yeah sure its woo hoo for massachusetts like great for people in massachusetts and california and it definitely is a step forward but its not new york

56006 we will have some increased aspect of inspection and if deemed necessary will do more work in certain areas we identify as potentially unstable we will do some more scaling more drilling some more blasting some more remedial rock work put in some more bolts some more mesh
56007 theres been nothing to suggest in any recent surveys any imminent issues or imminent problems that would have required immediate work theres no red flag so to speak
56008 is there a contingency plan what is it when are they going to reveal it why have they not told us yet what that plan is
56009 i can absolutely assure you the contingency plans include how to deal with issues like rock slides how to move the public and the visitors in the event theres any interruption like that
56010 if the games started this morning and we were faced with a situation like this there would be a lot of things we would have to consider so that is the work thats still in front of us and will continue almost till the very end
56011 clearly what we will be doing with our partners is working with them to make sure any scenario will be covered off
56012 i turned around and the guy sitting right behind me was standing up and stabbing another guy with a big rambo knife right in the throat repeatedly
56013 i said give me a hand and lets get this guy and the other guy took off
56014 some people were puking some people were crying some people were shocked
56015 he just looked at us and dropped the head on the ground totally calm
56016 they were very brave they reacted swiftly and calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
56017 its not every day that someone gets stabbed on a bus i imagine it would be fairly traumatic for the other passengers on the bus and the way they reacted was extraordinary
56018 i tried to lay down at 4 oclock this morning and i was up 10 minutes later because every time i close my eyes i see this man in the window with some guys head i just smoked a cigarette with an hour before
56019 he seemed to be all right i didnt get to know him
56020 he just told me where he was going i told him where i was going
56021 what can you do when a mans got a knife the size of you know its a big knife so we just tried to stay out of the way
56022 no there was no tension the guy got on the bus sat down beside the fellow the fellow offered him the seat woke up said yeah go ahead fell back asleep next thing you know hes getting stabbed repetitively
56023 and then i guess he cuts buddys head off and he walks up to the door holds the head in the door and just looks at him crazy like and just drops the head
56024 people should always be open to looking at precautionary measures but lets keep in mind that as bizarre and tragic as this is it is extremely rare
56025 a satisfied customer is the best business strategy of all
56026 he told the police he had nothing to do with this
56027 will be undertaking outbound telephone calls to various sources including neighbours to verify the information supplied is correct
56028 earthquake measuring 9 0 on the richter scale has hit beijing causing millions of casualties and putting the 2008 olympic games at risk
56029 everyone else started screaming and it got so big so quickly
56030 all you see was a big old the whole store was filled with smoke
56031 the cops were telling us to evacuate and get out of there
56032 this thing is for real rest assured aol and intel will follow through with their promises for fear of facing a multi million dollar class action suit similar to the one filed by pepsi co against general electric not too long ago
56033 i thought this was a scam myself but two weeks after receiving this e mail and forwarding it on microsoft contacted me for my address and within days i received a check for 24 800 00 you need to respond before the beta test is over if anyone can afford this bill gates is the man its all marketing expense to him please forward this to as many people as possible you are bound to get at least 10 000 00 were not going to help them out with their e mail beta test without getting a little something for our time my brothers girlfriend got in on this a few months ago when i went to visit him for the baylor u t game she showed me her check it was for the sum of 4 324 44 and was stamped paid in full

56037 they are different and hard to understand so im going to stick to what i know
56038 this has been largely accomplished through the granting of 15 year unrestricted open licences to telecom fiji and vodafone fiji they benefit from a combination of certainty and flexibility rather than waiting for their former licences to expire in 2014
56039 the open licences for telecom fiji and vodafone fiji have been issued with no initial upfront charge representing a substantial saving
56040 fmf has returned and they conveyed the good news to us yesterday so we are very happy about that
56041 my company has resolved with mr narayan that we will work together and give our support to ftib from next year onwards however we need ftib to support export oriented companies
56042 our decision to pull out of the exporter of the year awards was based on the response of ftib to the recent struggle faced by the bottled water industry
56043 ftib did not provide any support or assistance towards the bottled water industry during this struggle and in fact ftibs chairman publicly supported the imposition of the unreasonable and draconian excise and export duties in spite of many of us trying to explain to him that his assumptions about our businesses were simply incorrect
56044 vmware esxi delivers dramatically quicker and easier installation of virtual appliances this enables our customers to deploy altor s virtual network analysis and security solutions even faster giving them instant visibility into their virtual network activity said amir ben efraim chief executive officer of altor networks with vmware esxi accelerating the pace of virtual appliance deployments in the datacenter the demand for virtual network firewalls also accelerates we are excited to be a vmware partner and support vmware esxi across our products simplifying the delivery and deployment of catbird s v agent virtual appliance via the open virtualization format ovf and vmware esxi is a terrific component of our goal of ensuring catbird customers have instant easy to use protection and compliance for their virtual environments
56045 the vmware virtual appliance marketplace is a great vehicle for our appliance and is a user friendly high value place to shop companies are rapidly deploying virtualization technology because of its clear financial benefits however the potential security threats are often overlooked said juliette sultan head of global marketing at check point software technologies our vpn 1 security solution fully supports vmware esxi implementations so customers can protect the data communication on their virtual networks with the same proven security used to protect their physical networks by utilizing the open virtualization format ovf for our virtual appliance mindtouch deki becomes even easier for customers to test drive and use
56046 the ability to easily import and deploy our virtual appliance with vmware esxi means fewer troubleshooting issues and a higher adoption rate two keys to advancing deki in the marketplace the spread of vmware esxi will no doubt contribute to the ongoing success of mindtouch deki
56047 vmware esxi represents an opportunity to vastly expand the overall virtualization ecosystem said punit minocha vice president of business development at trend micro business development
56048 vmware esxi confirms vmware s trajectory to keep layering on the breakthroughs said stephen dennis president of virtualappliances
56049 it has become clear to me that after the orchestrated politically inspired media event staged a few weeks ago that this campaign will ultimately be focused not on issues but on one unflattering photograph
56050 though i am innocent of these accusations against me i believe my continued presence in this state senate race will be a distraction
56051 have nothing to do with bonusgate they have nothing to do with bribery corruption misappropriation
56052 if you look at when these charges came down there is no reason at all why these charges could not have been deferred until after the election and allow the people to make their choice
56053 from the beginning of this campaign i have said that we need someone from outside the tired democratic political machine that supported mike veon and hand picked sean ramaley all that yesterdays announcement does is give that same set of back room political bosses the ability to change the name of their hand picked candidate and thats not the kind of change we need
56054 any time you have a tumult in a district it gives the opposition an opportunity for a pickup
56055 but how great an opportunity this is for republicans remains to be seen the republican situation is clearly better now than it was when sean ramaley was in the race and was not under indictment
56056 if you are elder vogel you would rather be running against an indicted sean ramaley than against a replacement democrat
56057 if he has to defend himself against such serious charges he wouldnt be able to represent the people in his district with the energy and time they deserve
56058 on who replaces him and how that person is chosen
56059 if the county committee chooses someone by a secretive process one without participation by ordinary democrats that creates its own problems
56060 there are some outstanding individuals who have expressed interest in running for the senate seat
56061 i believe the eventual democratic nominee will win in november
56062 brian has to be up there with the leaders at 18 miles
56063 the family was getting poor it was hard for me but i didnt see any future for my family i had to escape

56085 during and after working hours both on and off the premises and with the actual knowledge of his peers and superiors he used and continues to use his position of power and authority over vulnerable economically dependent and emotionally vulnerable subordinates to seduce or compel as circumstances might warrant intimate sexual relations of conventional as well as deviate nature
56086 im not this awful person and the allegations are not true
56087 i never heard any such claims until after she was fired and most of the allegations occurred while we were both with another firm and before i was with my new firm she called and asked to come to work for us

56090 the success of americas experiment in democracy lies in broad participation and deep civic engagement from the civil rights amendments to womens suffrage to the abolition of the poll tax and finally the ratification of the twenty sixth amendment we have witnessed a steady by difficult march toward a more inclusive nation to realize the full potential of these great strides the student voter act provides a pathway to participation for americas youth
56091 we held umbrellas we brought them pizza we got them excused from class so they wouldnt lose their places in line we did everything we could to ensure everyone who wanted to vote got to vote voting is our right that should never happen again

56093 several obstacles stand in the way of youth voting because so many students are first time voters they often are unfamiliar with how to register in some states including my own state of illinois first time voters must register in person in order to cast an absentee ballot for students who attend college outside of their home state or who do not have access to transportation these requirements can be cumbersome confusing and insurmountable

56202 israel considers this to be a real and serious danger
56203 the israeli enemys persistence in its violations of lebanese airspace territorial waters and territory especially during the past few days is an unacceptable provocative escalation that calls for condemnation and serious action on the part of the concerned lebanese authorities as well as the un bodies
56204 i think they are oiling up their 57mm guns again
56205 the israeli overflights have increased lately and it looks like the israelis are provoking hizballah into showing their deployments
56206 they are allowing diplomacy a chance in order for it to fail
56207 by filing a quite unprecedented complaint they are holding the un and the lebanese government accountable which means hizballah is paving the way for a military response
56208 they need to keep some surprises left in case of another war
56209 prosecutors said gerber had not found any evidence that its product had been tampered with and the man was charged with making threats and falsely claiming to have tampered with a consumer product
56210 we are aware of a recent posting on the internet and believe this is a malicious hoax
56211 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority we are taking this issue seriously and are cooperating fully with federal authorities
56212 sending threats and falsely claiming to have tampered with a consumer product
56213 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
56214 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
56215 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the un soldiers on the ground
56216 having in mind concerns raised by members of the council regarding potential developments
56217 its very likely some would say inevitable that we will discuss this again over the coming months
56218 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue

56247 im thinking that shes probably been there for a number of years
56248 part of the mystery here is that apparently none of these children were in school
56249 home schooling under this situation removes almost any chances of us catching up with these kinds of things until there is a catastrophe
56250 she was kind of secluded shed talk but not much

56256 pfc lavena johnson was raped beaten set on fire and worse army calls it suicide
56257 i told my wife i could let it go but someone would get away with murder and i couldnt live with myself
56258 women serving in the us military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq the scope of the problem was brought into acute focus for me during a visit to the west los angeles va health center where i met female veterans and their doctors my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 of the female veterans seen there say there were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military and 29 said they were raped during their military service
56259 so all the deaths and injuries at gitmo and abu ghraib were just sports injuries
56260 come to iraq and get rich and have all the target practice you want on real people
56261 i told my wife i could let it go but someone would get away with murder and i couldnt live with myself
56262 everything in war is barbaric but the worst barbarity of war is that it forces men collectively to commit acts which individually they would revolt with their whole being

56273 but you have to listen to it to understand it it can be uplifting sometimes and it can be degrading
56274 lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink when did we see you a stranger and make you welcome naked and clothe you sick or in prison and go to see you
56275 i tell you solemnly in so far as you did this to one of the least of these brothers of mine you did it to me
56276 in so far as you neglected to do this to one of the least you neglected to do it to me
56277 in the liturgy one feels the necessity to recover the sense of the sacred above all in eucharistic celebration since we believe that what happens at the altar goes far beyond what we can humanly imagine and so the faith of the church in the real presence of christ in the eucharistic species is expressed through adequate gestures and comportments different from those of daily life
56278 we are not in front of a political figure or a personage of modern society but before god when the presence of eternal god descends on the altar we must place ourselves in a posture more apt for adoring it in my culture in sri lanka we ought to prostrate ourselves with head to the pavement as the buddhists and muslims do in prayer

56283 as mens wear continues to evolve and becomes a little more casual without becoming grungy its not impossible anymore to be dressed up in shorts
56284 for women legs are a sex symbol where for men legs are more private

56286 the idea of being threatened by the objectified male body has gone the process is complete
56287 its so hot here in mid july and august that we wanted to combine the two issues

56289 its a pretty strait laced office and i quickly retreated from that position
56290 it seems so strange on an over 90 degree day to subject yourself to sartorial rigidity
56291 no one has ever spoken to me about it and if anyone decides they dont like it or they wont take me its their loss
56292 zones in which this kind of exposure is accepted are permeable
56293 i cant do sex but i can give you a stickjob
56294 she certainly didnt show she could be counted on to take care of her job here at home

56307 i just turned around right as it hit the ground and i just saw a white piece of plane fly up in the air and smoke and that was it

56350 there were people everywhere singing dancing and praying in groups
56351 it just wasnt sydney thats why it was so special as well
56352 i have never seen sydney so transformed from being a city whose main focus seemed to be money success and dont care for anyone else it became a city where everyone you passed was smiling laughing and more than ready to have a conversatioin with you no matter what country you were from
56353 the sheer joy of being a pilgrim shone on every face
56354 even though we were walking at least four kilometres a day waking up at six and going to bed at eleven if we were lucky sleeping on a classroom floor and showering in something that resembled a cupboard with only shower curtains to hide you from the person next to you no one was grumpy or sad
56355 teenagers were jumping up and down with excitement to see this holy man and teams of people were running as best they could through the crowds just to keep up with the pope mobile
56356 now that its over i find myself wishing that the pilgrimage had never ended
56357 i miss the atmosphere of it and the unaccountable happiness that was felt by all i met and saw
56358 i know ill never forget this experience and that ill treasure it all the days of my life
56359 there will be a lot happening and we are hoping people will come especially for the demonstrations
56360 we have also had service clubs provide funding and local business have been a great help as well
56361 this facility is imperative for our volunteers to train and it is the only one north of forbes in the central west so it will be used across the region
56362 there is unanimous support there to attract jobs and opportunities and we have now created the inverell development support group which will be chaired by cr johnston
56363 we are hoping that we will also be able to organise federal government funding as well which could bring the total amount to 700 000
56364 we need to be able to work together under these circumstances which is why the support group has been created
56365 the investment fund is definitely the best way forward for inverell
56366 i have also had a number of calls of a confident nature for businesses that are prepared to negotiate either expanding and possibly creating more jobs in inverell
56367 so despite the very devastating situation hopefully we can extract some opportunities and get those jobs to the community
56368 community relations have definitely improved with the company after last weeks announcement of the closure
56369 they have recognised the social and economic effects on the community and we are appreciative of the support the company has given us
56370 nestle will also be there for networking to attract business opportunities if they become available
56371 it is heartening to know that we are working towards getting back on track
56372 obviously it is going to take a bit of time but we have something to work towards now
56373 at this stage we are matching the funding received from the department and we will be a part of the support group
56374 we will be happy to talk to businesses who show an interest in the factory site and discuss the options that are available
56375 excuse me oops never mind i didnt see your sign
56376 nope we just pack our stuff up once or twice a week to see how many boxes it takes heres your sign

56393 we now face the ultimate test we have a decision to make because people dont vote for divided parties
56394 the core of microsoft growth is based around office the server products and sharepoint i think this is a huge announcement in terms of giving people the ability to choose
56395 we wanted to eliminate the advantage microsoft has with the office monopoly and this eliminates that advantage for microsoft because now a user can choose to use alfresco as easily as they would choose to use sharepoint
56396 if he beats his chest and says we are not playing fair or whatever like this is some closed secret of microsoft then i think that proves that sharepoint is the worse product but if its really as good a product as they say then should not be ashamed to have it compete fairly with alfresco
56397 theyre able to leverage other infrastructure investments in data centers maybe the java world maybe linux to be able to deploy a much more cost effective and scalable solution to meet their content management needs
56398 its very good news for the cio who clearly has had a tough time negotiating with a monopoly
56399 the hardware is a kind of box that consumers reluctantly buy in order to play our games
56400 its natural for the current customer to expect nintendo is going to once again do something different

56404 but your lack of education and supreme stupidity led you to believe
56405 we know archimedes did mechanical astronomy here 100 years earlier and this could be from his home city it could have been inspired by his work or it could have been a local tradition that he started
56406 there must have been an unbroken tradition of craftsmen doing this kind of work but they didnt write it down in books for the most part they were teaching through workshops and appreticeships so were not going to get much other evidence
56407 the machine as a whole was not just showing high science showing astronomy but was linking science to the cultural cycles of the greeks
56408 companies make a mistake when they assume that people will come when its built but then you go to a property and find out that its empty

56410 hezbollahs power grab in beirut this effort to undermine lebanons elected government needs to stop and all those who have influence with hezbollah must press them to stand down immediately
56411 working with the international community and the private sector to rebuild lebanon and get its economy back on its feet
56412 we must support the implementation of un security council resolutions that reinforce lebanons sovereignty especially resolution 1701 banning the provision of arms to hezbollah which is violated by iran and syria
56413 its time to engage in diplomatic efforts to help build a new lebanese consensus that focuses on electoral reform an end to the current corrupt patronage system and the development of the economy that provides for a fair distribution of services opportunities and employment

56421 we cannot build enough prisons to solve this problem and the idea that we can keep incarcerating and keep incarcerating pretty soon were not going to have a young african american male population in america theyre all going to be in prison or dead one of the two
56422 ok ill get in by they way why do they call it goemonburo
56423 oh thats because a villain named goemon was boiled to death in a furo just like the one you are in
56424 extraordinary moment because it marks the high water mark of all the many debates and resolutions weve had in terms of bipartisanship

56432 saddams goal is to achieve the lifting of u n sanctions while retaining and enhancing iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs we cannot we must not and we will not let him succeed
56433 the community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat iraq poses now a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists if we fail to respond today saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow
56434 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of september 11 2001 it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons should he succeed in that endeavor he could alter the political and security landscape of the middle east which as we know all too well affects american security
56435 i am absolutely convinced that there are weapons i saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out
56436 today was a major step in the legal effort to clear my name the court has not issued a ruling on my motion to withdraw my guilty plea for now i will continue my work in the united states senate for idaho

56438 i love these children deeply they are my family here when i am with them i feel as if i belong in this unknown place maybe it is because i make them feel like they belong we are all foreigners in this strange place
56439 this trip has served so many purposes in my life both academically and spiritually
56440 every day poses a new challenge and a new solution which i have discovered is probably one of the most thrilling things about teaching
56441 its been a wonderful experience to be able to listen to the unique view that the christian scholars who are our professors have on the monuments of avebury stonehenge londons buildings coventry cathedral salisbury cathedral and other churches that we have visited
56442 theres something about being in the same historic place day in and day out as historic oxford writers wrestling with the critical faith issues that were as pressing for us as they were for them
56443 the total experience has strengthened the connections between the students and the writers providing a genuinely fresh perspective from which to see life career and the world but sharing the experiences together while living in the same house working and playing hard has also strengthened the ties between all of us in the program here it has already turned out to be an unforgettable journey together
56444 ive been told by other people who have come back from oxford that it changes you and theyre right i have changed
56445 ive gotten used to a slower pace and ive become more confident trying to travel in a foreign country ive become more aware of who i am and what i believe not based on what other people have told me its been a real shaping experience
56446 it is clear that the presidency is now very much

56449 blackwater would not be doing business in iraq if we still had our 1991 military capability
56450 between 2001 and 2006 we were busy creating homeland security that clinton could have done after the first attack on the world trade center in 1993
56451 it is my contention in response to an attempt to kill thousands in the u s homeland clinton could have formed and funded something like a homeland security in 1993
56452 bush initially resisted the idea of a new department which had been championed primarily by democrats in the wake of the attacks
56453 i think its hard to project four years from now
56454 it is very difficult to know what were going to be inheriting

56473 if dont get married in the next two years im going to a sperm bank parker takes great offense at the vagina monologue productions and really tees off on women in the military im still a little uncertain how allowing women in the military leads to the demise of men but parkers pretty sure about this everything you need to know about the book gets nicely summed up in the conclusion as long as men feel marginalized by the women whose favors and approval they seek as long as they are alienated from their children and treated as criminals by family courts as long as they are disrespected by a culture that no longer values masculinity tied to honor and as long as boys are bereft of strong fathers and our young men and women wage sexual war then we risk cultural suicide
56474 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point
56475 for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season
56476 our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us
56477 we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation

56483 we would like to see self regulation make progress to give the public confidence that isps are taking reasonable steps to improve the safety of the online environment for internet users
56484 if isps do not act then there is a risk that regulation will be imposed as the community increasingly demands a safer internet netsafe recognises that isps are best placed to know what actions are required to create the safer environment we are seeking
56485 we have been progressing self regulatory models with isps for quite some time an industry led process will help providers become more consumer friendly and ensure they are taking sensible pragmatic steps to protect their customers
56486 if progress towards self regulation slows we could see growing calls from government and organisations like netsafe and others who wish for stronger online enforcement determining legislative action that could hurt telcos isps and the public at large
56487 internetnz has worked with isps to develop a draft code of practice that provides a framework for self regulation it is important that isps consider this matter seriously a pragmatic industry led process can still achieve public buy in and government support

56499 our position is that the ioc has always encouraged the beijing 2008 organizers to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet
56500 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
56501 this is a great opportunity for us to show chinese readers what first class journalism we can deliver but of course we will also want to check if the site is still available after the olympics have ended
56502 this is just the first step in a process that must be followed through with a firm and unwavering commitment from all sides that full internet access will be provided immediately at the press center
56503 anything short of that fails to meet the assurances provided by the ioc and beijing organizers that the media will be allowed to report the news freely
56504 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
56505 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
56506 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity
56507 it was better than i expected the organisation was great and the music and atmosphere were fantastic
56508 we did say that it would be difficult to get repetitions for the third guy now that hes getting some repetitions were doing it in a fashion that keeps it i guess you could say in all fairness if hes going to replace somebodys reps hell take those first team reps
56509 i had no expectations about when my reps would come
56510 its strictly about me being ready if they would have said the first day to jump in there i would have been ready if they say it a month from now im going to be ready its my job to be ready
56511 because with the limited reps hes had so far if it was all new to him this year he wouldnt be where he is
56512 thinking about if im more comfortable than anyone else is not an efficient use of what i want to be doing right now in camp
56513 its about preparing to come out here and play well and then playing well
56514 theres no question to me that j t osullivan is tough
56515 hes competitive hes resilient now if he can play quarterback thatd be great
56516 you want to be out there getting the reps but im just trying to get mental reps back there and be ready to go today
56517 its going to happen in fairness ive got three guys competing for it
56518 just because of the way reps are its difficult to be 100 percent fair with reps but were doing the best we can
56519 do you have a dollar i need it for the bus fare

56521 a residency programme is a high commitment so the internship is an opportunity for the university to ensure we have the right candidate and the candidate to ensure they are on the right track
56522 the training is the clinical equivalent of a phd it takes just as much time and effort but provides a different pathway to high end skills
56523 these people are in very high demand overseas theres an international market for specialists and its pretty hard for us to keep up with salaries overseas but we can provide a supportive environment and encourage specialists to stay on its a very real benefit both for the vet hospital the vet school in terms of teaching capability and for new zealand to have access to these very skilled vets
56524 i was happy being a general practitioner but i was becoming bored and frustrated by my surgical caseload and ability my skills werent quite what i would have liked them to be
56525 i had one case was referred to companion animal surgeon warwick bruce and was able to scrub in he made it look so simple fixing the fracture on a dog with precision and smoothness of the surgery i thought i am so far from this but i would like to get there
56526 moving to palmerston north is a lot better than having to move to the states
56527 this will have an immensely beneficial effect for existing staff who at present already work long hours and regularly return after a full day to attend to critically ill or debilitated patients as the referral centre for a large area of new zealand we regularly have patients arriving in need of very close care or monitoring it also enhances the quality of care we can offer clients and moves us towards receiving accreditation from the new zealand veterinary association as a bestpractice hospital a goal we would like to achieve to show our support for a very good initiative
56528 its a substantial contribution to vet education and one which both the institute and the wider profession will benefit from
56529 we are very excited to be able to support the massey vet teaching and to further enhance our commitment to the future of the new zealand veterinary profession

56553 there is no power problem really and the a03 stepping that is due in the near future has nothing to do with it in fact bumping the core voltage from 1 3v to 1 375v 1 is simply doing their part to make those pesky polar bears go away quicker not indicative of any problems silly customers polar bears can eat you
56554 fruit trees were originally looked at as a nuisance by some city officials they were never thought of as useful but there is value in fruit our project has value to people

56556 its their main source of fruit in the summer months they love it
56557 we hope this speaks to you the one out of step
56558 this is another set of competitive earnings for shell shareholders
56559 good operating performance combined with increased oil and gas prices offset the impact of weaker downstream conditions in the second quarter 2008 shell is making substantial targeted investments to grow the company for shareholders and help ensure that energy markets remain well supplied
56560 but they are having a difficult time apparently spending the money that they have
56561 but they remain uneven and are not adequate to meet current demand
56562 improved security across the country has helped reduce attacks on oil pipelines and the electricity sectors expanded operations and maintenance programs have helped increase production
56563 emblematic of this struggle is the fact that two thirds of the raw sewage produced in baghdad flows untreated into rivers and waterways
56564 they obviously have made enormous economic progress by virtue of improving their oil sector and theyve made significant security progress
56565 however on the governance and political front there are still hurdles
56566 for progress to really occur across iraq theyre going to have to remedy that
56567 the success of the program is evident in the fact that there have been no successful attacks on northern oil lines this year
56568 more needs to be done to bring iraq closer to the vision of the compact
56569 although it will take time for them to have their full impact and for this to be visible the effort shows the real commitment brought by the government to the compact process
56570 at a time when media attention is almost wholly focused on the difficulties and violence in iraq the progress achieved to date represents an important reminder of positive developments
56571 the report before you demonstrates the commitment of the government of iraq to the agenda of the compact it provides a good record of achievements and contains a very useful account of the situation in iraq showing both progress and constraints
56572 given the context of relentless violence in iraq the progress achieved thus far under the compact initiative is remarkable
56573 to do so the government and people of iraq require the sustained support of the international community in every way possible
56574 there must be more debt relief including more debt write off
56575 iraq is in a difficult situation it is at this critical juncture that the government needs the support of the international community so that it can face the daunting challenges ahead
56576 it will take months and years before specific tangible outcomes are seen on the ground by the iraqi people and the international community
56577 most dangerous threat to all iraqis we will continue to pursue them we will also continue our dialogue wherever and whenever possible with groups that oppose this governments policy strategies this is important both for iraq and regional stability
56578 immense contribution that the coalition forces have made to empowering the people of iraq and overcoming tyranny
56579 for both the us and the iraqi government to define more clearly the status of the coalition forces in iraq in the context of our partnership in the battle against terrorism and deterring regional predators
56580 before we can adequately attend to our own security would cause a disaster for iraq and the region
56581 it is only two months since sharm el sheikh and what we intend to do the governor al shabibi and i we will resume our consultations and visits to the capitals of the key countries saudi arabia kuwait bulgaria and others to really get more concrete disbursement of the commitments they have made
56582 we are currently negotiating with others in order to do the same or at least write off some of the debts
56583 were talking about a dozen companies most of them but not all significant multinationals who are looking at quite significant opportunities
56584 providing there isnt a fallback in the security position my sense is that security today would not need to improve further in order for us to see quite significant investment
56585 basra has got an awful lot of things going for it
56586 in terms of a number of other countries in the world that have perfectly successful healthy economies with growth and inward investment its much closer to those today than it would have been a year ago
56587 if youre used to operating in kazakhstan venezuela or the niger delta then actually you look at iraq in a very very different way than someone would sitting in london
56588 you have to balance it in terms of a world view of iraq as opposed to matching iraq to whatever countries in the world you would judge to be best in terms of governance
56589 theres no question that even on a one to two year view its actually quite easy to see that investment could be measured in billions
56590 i would very very much hope and expect that within this calendar year we would see some real movement on that its the next thing to happen
56591 iraq is a significant economic country certainly within the region but arguably within the world
56592 i am pleased that our stockholders have followed the recommendation of the eds board of directors and supported the combination of eds and hp
56593 not only does the combination of these two great companies create immediate value for our stockholders it also enhances our ability to achieve our customers needs
56594 if anything i thought it would promote and build traffic on the social media sites that we developed lists for
56595 hard charging financial tv commentator by day not so closeted homosexual by night
56596 i was blown away truly i had to sit down
56597 longtime bear tosses in the towel says new bull market is upon us
56598 i apologize to my partners and to my friends and especially to the sec for whom i have the greatest possible respect i never intended markets to be manipulated in this manner i was only trying to make some traders who have been having a tough year break a smile
56599 holy jumpin f ckin sh t balls jesus lord protector of all that is good amp holy deliver me from fat people in short pants
56600 i think a recovery has to start in the real estate markets where the problems originated
56601 thats what were looking for more than anything to play fast
56602 its a time to show how far along we are and to gauge how much work we have ahead of us
56603 for the young guys its a great chance to get into a game like mode to be out there without the coaches in your ear going through all your assignments and just playing football
56604 this weekend is especially important because it shows a little bit of game speed you have to show that you know what youre doing and that you know the offense you have to prove it
56605 its very critical with jeff and i getting maybe six reps a day if i do six right and he does six right thats not enough to tell whos the better player
56606 we give our quarterback a better chance to play well when we do things right when were where were supposed to be if we can do that for him everything will take care of itself
56607 i just hope our guys can do our part in the run and the pass
56608 we could come out here in spandex shorts and wife beaters muscle t shirts and im happy
56609 its just a different type of atmosphere around here right now on defense
56610 its about having the mindset of practicing every day like you want to play thats what coach zimmers stressing
56611 im reading a course by bernie schaeffer is it a waste of time
56612 yeah ive always gotten an angry lesbian vibe from eps blogs
56613 i dont even know what that means im imagining something hot dont correct me if i am wrong
56614 damn you paulson damn you and your treasury securities lending facility
56615 its not the tslf you ass its the damn primary dealer credit facility thats saving their bacon slap my ass and call me linda im going to have to cancel my trip to the vanderbilt spring festival now
56616 i just got fired from bear and no onell take my calls
56617 the only time im able to have sex with my girlfriend is when im thinking about chuck prince
56618 ive been invited to a six week long bridge tournament i really want to go but my companys in the shitter what should i do
56619 i am used to db just repackaging wsj articles and making posts out of them to pass the time but ep too
56620 i have become so bullish that i have decided to convert my dedicated short funds into long only partnerships
56621 equity private is comparing some annualized numbers to other cumulative numbers this is is exactly the type of shit right wing half wits try to pawn off on the american people as an honest look at the fiscal state of the government
56622 pgp thats pete g peterson told me unfunded pv liabils around 40 tril and thats not ugk tril im talking about rnp bun b or was it pimp c last night on pbs
56623 oh ep now that you posted your answers i went to look it up i see only 9 6 trillion in household equity in the z1 may i ask where are you getting your number
56624 how about some answers cut the benefits that go largely to the elderly thats not gonna happen there will be colonies of sick old people sleeping under bridges gross
56625 ep wants to make this a political site judging by her comments and the comments of a few in reaction to her post no thanks i have plenty of places to go for that this entitlement thing is not tabloid material unless you want tabloid quality discussion
56626 unless its easily looked up on google and everyone knows the answer im guessing the annual defense budget is more than 0 5 trillion
56627 q what is the difference between a jew and a pizza
56628 im hearing from more and more market participants pillow talk that monday was a great start but but they think that the fed will rent mortgages and they have to take a step forward and actually buy the mortgages have the fed use its balance sheet and just get in there and buy
56629 wow canada really i didnt think there were any bad people in canada
56630 what do you think the royal canadian mounted police are there for
56631 well i always thought they were supposed to make sure the moose only crossed at the moose crossing signs
56632 over nearly 60 years we have become a nation of debtors who rely upon borrowed money to fund incremental economic growth
56633 hey this is an opportunity to learn something entirely new
56634 too bad they didnt cut me a break on that but mikes a good guy and hes always been my friend
56635 we couldnt have done what we did had that great run without them thats for sure
56636 one of the things youve got to be able to do as a coach is handle different relationships and know how to motivate them its a really outstanding testament to emmitt
56637 i know all of us feel blessed to go in but to go in with those two young men that i had a chance to work with probably had some play in continuing my coaching career is the topping on all of it
56638 but no matter what i do or what i get involved with in the end i just want to be known as a skater
56639 one of you is risking your life for the mongolians and the other is a traitor to everyone and himself only i am dying for my heritage the jin
56640 my mom died when i was one year old when i was three years old i made my dad so angry he died i grew up crawling around in the forest eating twigs
56641 if it were someone else i would mind doing this
56642 if he marries someone else ill marry someone else as well but in his heart there will only be me and in my heart there will only be him
56643 it would be like a club football team training with the dallas cowboys coaches
56644 the no 1 concern if im going to take a stance is whats going to happen to the cincinnati reds junior had one or two years left and theres still the possibility that the injury bug could step in again
56645 he was a great kid and still is a great man
56646 i hope he gets a chance to play in the world series
56647 i would have liked to see him finish out the year
56648 gives him a chance to play in the playoffs and maybe the world series obviously cincinnatis not going there
56649 all the years ive been around in the 30 years i dont think i met over two or three people that didnt like him he was just that well liked and after the races he would drink beer with the best of them
56650 when it came to kids night you couldnt even see his car from all the kids being on it and around it
56651 its neat to see the kids get into it like that to see the smiles on their faces and stuff thats half the ballgame right there you darn sure cant do it for the money you do it for the love of the sport
56652 youd have your battles with him but he was a real nice guy he wasnt afraid to run me hard and i wasnt afraid to run him hard he was a true race car driver
56653 the last time i put on this uniform i was 8
56654 and you beat us 12 0 in the father sons game
56655 february 10 2000 february 10 2000 this day will go down in reds history and will go down in major league history as the day one of the biggest trades in our sport took place when the michael jordan of baseball came home to cincinnati he is the player of the decade an all century player a player who was born in cincinnati has become one of the best players in our sport and has come home
56656 i couldnt believe how loud it was and how long it lasted
56657 this has put cincinnati back on the baseball map on top of the entire baseball world
56658 played hurt all year ive had a sore hamstring ive refused to come out when im hurt
56659 you should check things out before you put things on the air
56660 did you ask me if i was ok didnt you see me limping do you even know ive had a bad hamstring for a long time
56661 im relieved because they told me it was only a strain and isnt like last years that one was more pain
56662 junior did what he is supposed to do he got into a rundown on that play
56663 he came toward third and stopped quick i dont know how you can stop something like that from happening but he did what he needed to do
56664 im not going to play again until im 100 percent healthy
56665 just when he was starting to get his swing down and it looked like he was about to take off
56666 that goes back a few years to when i wouldnt autograph a ball for him
56667 he rips me all the time so why would i sign a ball for him hes ripped me ever since he needs to grow up
56668 it wasnt me who threw a ball into the center field seats after blowing a save that hit a woman it wasnt me fighting my manager lou piniella when he managed the reds and dibble was in the bullpen it wasnt me ripping off my uniform on the field when he blew a game after giving up a game winning home run in new york to bobby bonilla hes just mad and bitter because he was never more than a 100 miles an hour set up guy
56669 three years ago nobody heard of this surgery never heard of a torn hamstring being fixed
56670 nobody was doing it with this type of injury there is no way griffey could ever again play center field or left field or right field or anywhere zero none
56671 conversations i had with the reds recently revealed that nothing was up as far as trades other than a couple of inquiries they told me he was going to remain with the reds and they never came to us to ask whether junior would accept a trade
56672 i hadnt heard about any kind of trade but i did think it odd that the front office told kent mercker david weathers and adam dunn they wouldnt be traded but nobody said anything to me and nobody asked me or my agent anything about going to any other team
56673 being on the disabled list is tougher than playing you work much harder when youre on the dl id rather be playing its much easier
56674 i owe it to the fans and to myself to retire as a mariner every athlete wants to finish with the team with which he started
56675 im surprised he can go through the airport metal detectors without setting something off
56676 he must really love the game because he doesnt need the money he has gone through a lot of pain and suffering i have to damn near drag him out of the lineup
56677 ive known tony forever bobby sparks was the first person i ever met when racing and he introduced me to tony
56678 through the years weve been friends finally everything came together and we teamed up
56679 some years you dont have a good year or have a few struggles

56690 so how should conflict about message and messenger biblically be handled in the blogosphere here are a few thoughts that i hope will prove helpful and be an encouragement to you
56691 freddie mac which has been stung by surging delinquencies will double
56692 she goes so fast that we try not to be too hard on her
56693 she goes to the adioo volo then the pa finals then her stakes are done unless we supplement her to a few if she continues to improve we may want to do that
56694 she had some bad luck at the meadowlands and kind of needed a break from there
56695 shes had a couple of issues just a couple odds and ends hopefully well move forward from here i think this will braven her up a bit
56696 shes had some bad luck drawing but i like everything about her
56697 shes a little aggressive at times but overall a nice filly very ladylike

56700 we synchronize the traffic lights by the actual time of day
56701 traffic lights are synchronized with each other so your chances of hitting a green are quite good when thats the direction we actually favor
56702 when you have a lot of traffic lights that are clustered up its much more difficult to make coordination good in both directions
56703 sometimes im able to get some green streaks straight through and sometimes its like red red red red
56704 every time i stop and then go its just wasting more and more gas
56705 quick stops and the fast starts thats what really will destroy your fuel economy

56727 he never sat still he never shut up he would never stop asking questions
56728 he just wanted to go from one thing to another
56729 he might be rocking on the kickboard as hes waiting to swim
56730 thats the thing if i dont want to lose i can focus
56731 he i guess saw something in me and really has never given up on me through good times and bad
56732 hes been able to help me grow from the little 11 year old swimmer who didnt really know what he was doing to the person i am today
56733 not accomplishing a goal no matter what it is for me just makes me want it that much more
56734 when i didnt medal i was like all right well then im going to do this
56735 within seven months he set a world record in the 200 butterfly
56736 hes got a lot of biological advantages plus that desire
56737 if i could sleep in the water and not leave it thats probably my safest bet
56738 i would never get hurt i would never have any problems
56739 when i first saw michael in 96 i looked at his stroke i looked at his body type and said this kid is going to be awesome
56740 i would have liked it but theres a time and place for everything and that wasnt the time or the place i guess
56741 hes going to do as we say a little schooling to the rest of the world
56742 when im swimming i can make myself relax in any way whether its dont kick or dont pull as hard
56743 in the prelim of a race i wont use as much legs ill just do what i have to do to get in the finals
56744 what you clearly saw in melbourne is michael was the best in the world from the time his feet hit the wall until he takes his first stroke
56745 when your lungs are burning and you can hardly feel your arms and youre battling a guy head to head and then all of a sudden he gets a turbo boost and youve got to run him down
56746 but my mind is focused on the job that i have to do
56747 its just easy for me to do that i dont know why
56748 tuduhan dibuat oleh pegawai khas beliau sendiri bukan oleh kerajaan tetapi beliau memilih membawanya isu itu kepada pengundi
56749 no presidents really asked the public to spend more or give up something
56750 people are so frustrated theyre at least willing to contemplate the idea
56751 the argument cant just be about big multibillion dollar plans over the next 30 to 50 years its got to be about things they can do now that will bring the price down
56752 the reason weve seen prices soften in last couple of weeks is that demand is down
56753 it shows you what can happen if people actually do something themselves
56754 we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania in brazil named cara maria burke
56755 wait a minute were your friends as well dont just focus on the big guys think about us
56756 theres no excuse for any number of heat stroke deaths
56757 false words are not only evil in themselves but they infect the soul with evil
56758 please god dont let this one be the big one
56759 but thus do i counsel you my friends distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful
56760 even a thin person can have fat around the heart
56761 the security council refused to allow some members to hold the peacekeepers hostage to sudans latest attempt to derail justice
56762 the us decision to abstain is clearly a vote against giving president al bashir a get out of jail free card
56763 the security council told the court to investigate the crimes in darfur and its members should stand by that commitment to seek justice there this attempt to halt the iccs work is blatant political interference with an independent court
56764 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
56765 es dif cil estimar si el consumo de chocolate es realmente bajo o si apenas est estancado y creo que el caso es el segundo
56766 la ca da del consumo se debe a que los fabricantes juegan con los tama os de las barras y las recetas industriales reducen la cantidad de chocolate utilizado lo que produce una ca da del consumo
56767 es improbable que el cacao quede exento de una disminuci n de la demanda de todo tipo de compras discrecionales mientras los consumidores ven que su poder adquisitivo est recortado por el aumento de la inflaci n
56768 el m ximo impulso provino del mercado de lujo definido como chocolate que cuesta 16 d lares la libra o m s el resto de la categor a ha tenido suertes variadas dependiendo del tipo de producto
56769 la demanda de chocolate es fuerte y creciente en regiones donde no se ha desarrollado plenamente una cultura del chocolate por ejemplo en china o donde existe una cultura del chocolate establecida que se est sofisticando como en rusia o turqu a
56770 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
56771 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
56772 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
56773 nobody said to me listen to this it will do you good it wasnt like eating your vegetables to me it was ice cream
56774 it was just out and out a way of getting girls sitting them down and playing them the trio which it has to be said almost always worked
56775 now what was that piece that symphonic piece you had that was playing between 11 00 and 11 30
56776 the romans have defiled our altars these are druids singing and we have to get rid of them and we have to stab them and kill them and make their blood flow like rivers
56777 yes there is but ive got to warn you it starts very soon its a long opera its five hours weve got berliozs les troyens on tonight
56778 transports you puts girls in the right mood and just makes you love life
56779 now we wont have to worry about eating or using the bathroom in shifts and the children all have a room of their own
56780 all we are doing is selling them this house at zero percent interest mortgage its their house they purchased it
56781 they called me and told me that they had reviewed my old application
56782 then they asked me if i would come out and submit a new application
56783 but when youre together all you have is each other
56784 this stuff is going to get worse unless the economy turns around
56785 shall not require a multiple regression analysis or anecdotal evidence for a compensation discrimination case
56786 in yet another powerful showcase of twitters potential power as a disseminator of information today several people received the first information via the micro me
56787 went after the collaborators with a sanguinary fury that drenched the land with blood
56788 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
56789 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
56790 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
56791 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
56792 i went back to the room after meetings heard it saw it just kind of chuckled because i have no idea where it came from i have no idea where those stories come from
56793 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
56794 i thought that would be something they wouldnt do or try to stay away from as far as here i like the guys we have behind center right now in kyle and rex and i think those guys can definitely take us through
56795 why do some songs mercilessly stick in our heads and repeat themselves over and over
56796 we are very pleased to announce that the fda has issued an approvable letter for stavzor and we offer our congratulations to the banner and jds teams for this successful result
56797 we are now working with banner to satisfy the conditions to final approval as expeditiously as possible banner has advised that it expects to respond to the fdas requests in the coming weeks concurrently the noven jds team has begun launch and production planning in anticipation of a 2008 launch of stavzor
56798 valproate the active ingredient in stavzor is recommended by the american psychiatric association as a first line therapy for patients living with bipolar disorder and experiencing manic episodes
56799 the small size and soft gel capsule formulation of stavzor should make this new product easy to swallow which in my experience is critical to helping valproate patients start and stay on their medication
56800 our research indicates that valproate patients would prefer a small soft gel capsule like stavzor that is easy to swallow
56801 in a recent survey of 400 valproate users more than two thirds reported difficulty swallowing their other valproate medications and 85 percent said they would have preferred a small soft gel capsule had it been available when initiating therapy these are some of the patients who we expect to help with the launch of stavzor
56802 the approval of stavzor is an important development for patients who use valproate products and for our company
56803 for patients it represents a new easy to swallow treatment option that may help with compliance for noven it represents a significant step toward our goal of establishing noven as a high growth specialty pharmaceutical company
56804 we are not seeking independence we are happy to be a part of the peoples republic of china
56805 should the culture and the people of tibet the land of snows face a catastrophe then the responsibility of preserving at any cost this world heritage this pristine spiritual lineage of tibet which is in the tradition of the ancient university of nalanda will rest with you the trans himalayan people living in free countries
56806 you used to could buy a new car for 500
56807 eh you know we cant say anything bad about them or well get put in prison
56808 but tell them its not just tourism tell them to think about the tibetan people
56809 maybe ill watch some of it on television im not clear
56810 we say the situation here is stabilizing you say its tense
56811 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
56812 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
56813 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
56814 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
56815 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
56816 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
56817 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
56818 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
56819 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
56820 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
56821 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
56822 excuse me may i ask your opinon about what i should do here
56823 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth even as it is in heaven
56824 one of the patients came forward and filed an initial crime report and from there we went forward and interviewed her and were able to contact several more victims
56825 these people were scared initially to react to do anything one because they felt they were in the states illegally and had no rights
56826 i do have two victims that he did he told them that he said if you do say anything i will report to the immigration department and that was one of the concerns why they didnt want to come forward nobody has a right to take advantage of people regardless of their legal status
56827 come forward this is my case im not asking for any legal identification or forms in order to be taking a report a crime report if a crime occurred a report will be taken regardless of your legal status
56828 now that your injuries seem to be taken care of you really should start taking classes again the only time ive ever seen you completely happy is when youre dancing

56837 no way of now knowing what was in the box or how it may have assisted the clients defense
56838 no way of assessing how the seizure of the box may have forever compromised the defendants ability to present an effective defense
56839 quash the subpoenas requiring rusch and dry to appear in court for the hearing
56840 weve used up our stupid quotient it is time to get it right
56841 treat every person who presents himself or herself to you as a potential leader with the utmost suspicion
56842 many people are working hard right now to orchestrate your choice of leaders they are employing sophisticated psychological techniques
56843 obamas revelations were not an issue during his senate campaign two years ago but now his open narrative of early bad choices including drug use starting in high school and ending in college as well as his tortured search for racial identity are sure to receive new scrutiny
56844 the hard lesson to the music business here is that it must license venues for music acquisition that fans prefer to file sharing networks or otherwise make the toleration of file sharing part of their business plans if even radioheads freely available album was torrented 2 3 million times in the first three and a half weeks how can more traditional offerings successfully clamp down on file sharing they cant pure and simple
56845 the shift began in the late 1960s when urban regions from financial centers such as new york and chicago to old industrial cities such as detroit and cleveland began to suffer a massive exodus of predominantly white middle class residents this left behind an increasingly impoverished highly minority population with very little proclivity to support conservative or even moderate republicans today in some cities mostly old industrial centers in the east and midwest this population remains dominant and is likely to vote in huge numbers for obama most of these cities suffer poverty rates at least 50 percent higher than the national average at the same time some other cities such as new york chicago boston san francisco seattle and portland have done far better they have done so by attracting a population of well educated white professionals pockets of this demographic to be sure also exist in some hard hit industrial cities but the new urban affluents tend to concentrate in cities with industries such as financial services and media that provide excitement and the prospect of high wage employment in a glamorous setting many new urbanites tend to be students or professionals enjoying city life during their first highly experimental years of adulthood at this point they are most open to liberal ideas and causes they have yet to worry much about taxes and crime issues that drive people to the center as they grow older marry and raise families many in this cohort particularly those who do not ascend into the upper classes leave the urban core for the suburbs or other more affordable regions
56846 if i read this to you and did not tell you that it was an fbi agent describing what americans had done to prisoners in their control you would most certainly believe this must have been done by nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings sadly that is not the case this was the action of americans in their treatment of prisoners
56847 people say that gitmo is the gulag of our time like a concentration camp thats not true at all
56848 detainees are very picky if there is a piece of fruit that has a bruise on it or is at all bad they send it back and the military just sends it back and give them something more fresher and since everything has to come from florida it comes in on a big barge and it has to be perfect if it wasnt perfect to us we just lived with it but the detainees were pretty upset about it sometimes
56849 open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction
56850 has a fully pro choice record and we are confident that as president he will be a champion for womens reproductive rights
56851 i dont necessarily like his obamas policies i dont like much that he advocates but for the first time in my life history thrusts me to reeally seriously think about it voting for a democrat for president
56852 righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people
56853 oh sir i miss my wife is very hard to be here when she is there you understand sir he knows my name but always calls me sir
56854 growing up in my country no sex without marriage sometimes i see good looking woman here and think would be easy but cant do that it would be wrong thing
56855 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them
56856 give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you
56857 so you want me to give you my body without commitment and regardless of consequence you want me to continue to be feminine and nurturing and supportive and even cook and clean for you as long as youre interested in being around you want me to give up all the traditional protections and privileges of women and you dont want me to compete with you in the marketplace
56858 do all things without murmurings and disputings that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world
56859 i didnt know nothin honest but i love the guy
56860 i strongly disagree with todays supreme court ruling i am extremely concerned that this ruling will embolden state legislatures to enact further measures to restrict a womans right to choose and that the conservative supreme court justices will look for other opportunities to erode roe v wade which is established federal law and a matter of equal rights for women
56861 the u s constitution prohibits a religious test for public office but that is precisely what is being posed now romney is well aware that an unconstitutional religious test is being applied to him
56862 t here are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his churchs distinctive doctrines to do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the constitution
56863 the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality
56864 conservatives unhappy with our republican presidential candidates seem to be drifting aimlessly toward fred thompson and mike huckabee in the misguided belief that these candidates are more conservative than rudy giuliani and mitt romney

56881 iberdrola renewables has two large wind farms in colorado and we would like to invest more in the state
56882 the new energy economy strategy adds to an already favorable investment climate the wind blows in many places around the world but coloradans make their state a great place to make electricity from the wind
56883 gamesa and iberdrola renewables sign the largest single purchase of wind turbines ever
56884 we have thus a 100 electric vehicle but which is mixed battery hydrogen with regard to filling up with energy providing great flexibility in its use
56885 filling the tank understanding this as the recharging of the vehicles batteries costs between 6 and 8 times less than a petrol driven engine with the same autonomy
56886 with the current mix of energy production we can say that emissions are reduced 80 at least
56887 a booming market in spain is rewriting market dynamics for renewable energy based inverters moreover new incentives for green electricity in portugal and greece are set to accelerate the pace of growth in the future

56892 the administrator robbi ferrell chief of staff of office of enforcement and compliance assurance the branch of the agency charged with making sure environmental laws are followed had turned the epa into a secretive dangerous ally of polluters instead of a leader in the effort to protect the health and safety of the american people

56912 were pleased that dwon clifton will be joining the baylor family
56913 his professional playing experience and ability as a former player to relate to young student athletes make him a great addition to our staff
56914 having coached dwon and then following his career after clemson it is nice to be able to mentor him in a profession that he really wants to pursue
56915 with his wife lucinda and son kingston joining our family it will make for an easy transition to begin his career
56916 i had interest from numerous other schools but whats unique about the opportunity at baylor is my tie with coach driscoll who recruited me to play at clemson out of high school
56917 i have tremendous respect for coach driscoll and his work ethic that hes always displayed even now his work ethic is the same as i remember hes the same person
56918 ive always wanted to work with the right people coaches that fit the description of what i want to become i felt that this opportunity will allow me to get to where i want to as a coach and as a person
56919 how tragical is this woman with nothing but books about whitehead and little nubs of carpenters pencils
56920 honey millions of people saw that finale some thought it was genius some were disappointed but no one sobbed for three days i think we need a little bit of professional help here
56921 i would want to spend 24 hours with tony soprano and then i would want him to shoot me in the heart
56922 the only way to get your heart blown to smithereens is to choose the psychopath
56923 every military conflict from the american revolution to the civil war to the first gulf war has spawned music that reflected the moods emotions and sentiments of the nations fighting men and women
56924 songs from the soul of service serves to capture some of this history
56925 while providing recognition to talented songwriters and diversion and entertainment to participants and nonparticipants alike
56926 its so honest and personal i think this contest truly personalizes the image of the military it shows civilians that as the troops we represent so much more than uniforms and duty this contest gives us the chance to showcase what might otherwise remain silent or be forgotten
56927 these songs provided respite unit bonding and an expressive outlet during trying times
56928 in some cases these songs will transcend their times and become permanent fixtures in the nations patriotic songbook
56929 i really need someone to explain this stuff so that i can understand it
56930 ok i will help you but i cannot do it now while everyone is watching me you will have to stay late tonight
56931 well i thought it would be just another one night stand but amanda was different she was so sincere and trusted me with all her heart i had never experienced that before and so i fell in love for the first time
56932 i guess that is the same as you you trust me with all your heart and your friendship is so sincere it changes something in me it must be an afrikaner thing
56933 slowly boy you take my clothes off and make love to me
56934 eh i think people shouldnt live like dogs why scrimp and save like some pathetic dunno what we should spend as and when we feel like it
56935 i like to give the director the attention and respect he deserves because when i wrote a play in college people didnt pay attention very well they didnt get the point and i felt frustrated

56940 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
56941 he told the police he had nothing to do with this
56942 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
56943 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
56944 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
56945 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
56946 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
56947 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
56948 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
56949 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
56950 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
56951 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
56952 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
56953 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
56954 whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
56955 when our sons and daughters put their lives on the line to defend the rest of us the last thing they should fear is being attacked by one of our own
56956 im thinking that shes probably been there for a number of years
56957 part of the mystery here is that apparently none of these children were in school
56958 home schooling under this situation removes almost any chances of us catching up with these kinds of things until there is a catastrophe
56959 she was kind of secluded shed talk but not much
56960 it was the ideal family i mean the children were so respectful just so easygoing

56995 there is simply no indication that the regulations constrain femas discretion to the point that it is bound to provide assistance to all eligible individuals
56996 the whole point there is that the whole country is focused on something so far from here and there are problems in our backyard that no one is paying attention to
56997 the idea is to show what the situation is like now its amazing how badly it sill looks in the non tourist areas
56998 freedom in its purest sense meant service a heretofore untraveled road by which he might resume his long stalled journey toward fulfillment the experience of helping someone who so desperately needed help proved a heady and self nourishing sensation especially when his efforts met with far greater success than he had dared hope
56999 even with oil prices coming off a recent high consumers will be squeezed by high petrol and food prices rising home heating bills come winter and the continuation of the credit crunch until well into 2009
57000 we forecast that sales volumes will contract in july september the first such fall since early 2006 the next 12 months are shaping up to be the slowest period for retailers since the early 1990s
57001 our quarterly surveys have shown that there were 29 profit warnings by general retailers in the first six months of 2008 the highest number of warnings ever recorded by the sector in the first half economic fundamentals we believe even tougher times lie ahead with little evidence of a retail recovery until 2010
57002 but although there is clearly a demand for electric cars the only way for them to become a viable option is to have a sufficient infrastructure in place

57014 the nrf inadequately considers the needs of non english speakers who may be foreign visitors or immigrants make the draft nrf readily available in spanish and other languages spoken by a substantial portion of the population
57015 make civil service positions less vulnerable to political pressures from above by embracing meaningful whistle blower protections for all emergency managers including those with security clearances and provide an effective and supportive mechanism for receiving disclosures of inadequacies in emergency planning exercising and response
57016 framework is indeed a more accurate name for this product but it is not entirely accurate what is needed is a different product a plan not a name change
57017 the description of the fema director and dhs secretarys responsibilities conflicts with requirements of the post katrina reform act
57018 shifting nrf implementation to the dhs secretary is not consistent with the intent of congress as described in the post katrina reform act the head of fema and not the dhs secretary should be in charge of coordinating federal emergency response
57019 some esf functions may be inappropriately combined partitioned or privatized
57020 not all lessons learned are publicly reported or followed up with changes to plans for example as topoff 4 prepares to being the topoff iii after action report still has not been issued
57021 federal exercises frequently ignore recovery or give it lip service if addressed at all ensure that adequate exercise time is allowed to cover long term recovery issues in reasonable detail
57022 logic suggests that the fema administrator would be the coordinator of the federal response not the dhs secretarys advisor the roles of the fema director and director of operations coordination appear to conflict calling to mind post katrina confusion
57023 will feature thousands of federal state territorial and local officials these officials will engage in various activities as part of a robust full scale simulated response to a multi faceted threat
57024 the full scale exercise offers agencies and jurisdictions a way to test their plans and skills in a real time realistic environment and to gain the in depth knowledge that only experience can provide
57025 the purpose of a national exercise should be to test the adequacy of emergency plans and procedures
57026 but the topoff4 exercise testing national preparedness for a dirty bomb attack is being held before the draft national response framework has been finalized and early comments on the plan indicate that major revisions are needed
57027 even if the exercise is declared an overall success which is virtually a given in government exercises the plan is unscripted and it is questionable whether successes could be repeated thus the exercise may provide an opportunity for dhs officials to reject changes requested by state officials that dhs locked out of meetings to finish a draft nrf
57028 dhs was counting on a lot of negative publicity culminating next week when all the comments were initially expected a large scale exercise deflects that scrutiny and lends the appearance that everything is under control with the national response plan in transition and a framework under intense scrutiny exactly what plan will guide the thousands of federal state territorial and local officials what is the point of spending 25 million to train around a plan that will soon experience a massive overhaul the photo ops from topoff4 will provide americans with a false sense of security this nation is not ready to deal with a large scale disaster and americans need to see through this pr stunt and demand substance over looks
57029 dhs has made limited progress in the areas of emergency preparedness and response
57030 the latest report confirms that homeland security and fema are dysfunctional there have been countless reports since katrina and many make the same recommendations over and over instead of hearing from homeland securitys top brass congress ought to hear from whistleblowers within the department
57031 we are in the middle of a hurricane season that produced two category five storms in as many weeks homeland securitys leadership should be investigated
57032 ignored hid and manipulated government research on the potential impact of long term exposure to formaldehyde
57033 any level of exposure to formaldehyde may pose a cancer risk regardless of duration
57034 failure to communicate this issue is possibly misleading and a threat to public health

57039 states are not agents of morality and peace they are instruments of force disruption disorder death dismemberment and war instigated by those who rule them and command others peace is not brought by bombardment shock and awe and machine guns
57040 they have always taught and trained you to believe it will be your patriotic duty to go to war and to have yourselves slaughtered at their command but in all the history of the world you the people have never had a voice in declaring war
57041 the state lies in all the tongues of good and evil and whatever it says is lies and whatever it has it has stolen everything it is is false it bites with stolen teeth and it bites often it is false down to its bowels

57046 the widely invoked phrase of never again following the wwii holocaust which could be considered an historic vow proved to be empty rhetoric and bankrupt as a policy upon which any state was prepared to act
57047 in reviewing the history of the english government its wars and its taxes a bystander would declare that taxes were not raised to carry on wars but wars were raised to carry on taxes
57048 abstract the 20 th century closed with many lamenting civilian killings by the state as its greatest evil by one estimate governments killed as many as 170 million civilians from 1900 1987 more than all the soldiers killed in wars of the 20 th century the century closed with a new euphemism for killing and deportation ethnic cleansing freedom from risk of being killed by the state and freedom from having your group being the target of violence is surely an important component of social well being power kills absolute power kills absolutely democracies can also engage in massacre and genocide a majority may agree on the killing of an unpopular minority famous examples are the democratic governments of australia canada and the united states who killed indigenous peoples it is an open empirical question whether democracy turns economic development toward benevolent ends
57049 half a century has shown that exaggerated nationalism is so perilous as to place in question mans very survival
57050 mortalities at hands of indian government include over 250 000 sikh men women and children since 1984 300 000 christians in nagaland and elsewhere 90 000 muslims in kashmir tens of thousands of assamese bodos dalits manipuris tamils and other minorities it is reported that more than 52 000 sikhs remain imprisoned without charge or trial under tada an act which expired in 1995 according to amnesty international tens of thousands of other minorities are also being held as political prisoners
57051 money rules the world with power to control the money supply you control the world thats just reality politicians all succumb to the powers that be once initiated their options become clear either expose the ruse and commit political suicide while potentially collapsing the economy or play the bankers game by the bankers rules politicians are the puppets not the puppet masters
57052 war is a racket it always has been it is possibly the oldest easily the most profitable surely the most vicious it is has international scope it is the only one in which profits are reckoned in dollars and losses in lives a racket is best described as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people only a small inside group knows what it is about it is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the vary many out of war a few people make huge fortunes
57053 with children they mixed in mob in crater and all died together
57054 can you imagine the profits of the military industrial complex from all of this do they really want the us public to know the truth about what the weapons they produce have done to iraqis who is really benefiting from this
57055 the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes
57056 the question of power and consequently of war is little else than a question of money those who stand ready to furnish this money are the real rulers the so called sovereigns of states are nothing more than tools employed by the wealthy they are simply the chiefs of different bands of robbers and murderers and these chiefs are dependent upon the lenders of blood money for the means to carry on their robberies and murders
57057 us forces and policies are completing the radicalization of the islamic world something osama bin laden has been trying to do with substantial but incomplete success since the early 1990s as a result it is fair to conclude that the united states of america remains bin ladens only indispensable ally
57058 nevertheless the first task of the iraqi occupation remains the first task of government to establish a monopoly on violence
57059 the trade of governing has always been monopolized by the most ignorant and the most rascally individuals of mankind
57060 good that we dont get all the government that we pay for
57061 if the government can take a mans money without his consent there is no limit to the additional tyranny it may impose upon him with his money it can hire soldiers to keep him in subjection plunder him at discretion and kill him if he resists
57062 democracy freedom patriotism proletariat general welfare the constitution fatherland war on terror
57063 in order to get power and retain it it is necessary to love power love of power is not connected with goodness but with qualities that are opposite of goodness such as pride cunning and cruelty
57064 power intoxicates men when a man is intoxicated by alcohol he can recover but when intoxicated by power he seldom recovers
57065 the few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent on its favors that there will be no opposition from that class while on the other hand the great body of people mentally incapable of comprehending will bear its burden without complaint
57066 by a continuing process of inflation governments can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens and while the process impoverishes many it actually enriches some the hidden process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which not one man in a million will be able to diagnose
57067 give me control of a nations money and i care not who makes the laws
57068 the best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency by a continuing process of inflation governments can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens
57069 remember democracy never lasts long it soon wastes exhausts and murders itself there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide
57070 all politics is grounded in lies deceits cover ups and distortions of reality
57071 the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country we are governed our minds molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of the invisible government tends to be concentrated in the hands of the few because of the expense of manipulating the social machinery which controls the opinions and habits of the masses it is not generally realized to what extent the words and actions of our most influential public men are dictated by shrewd persons operating behind the scenes
57072 to enforce the lies of the present it is necessary to erase the truths of the past
57073 it is the big bureaucrats and the corporates who are more corrupt than the poorest of the poor corruption has nothing to do with poverty it has everything to do with greed
57074 a q khan father of pakistans nuclear black market will remain off limits to the americans thats because khan has musharraf by the short hairs having hidden evidence of musharrafs complicity in nuclear deals with iran north korea and khan alone knows who else
57075 the indian state no longer generates public goods instead it creates private benefits for those who control it consequently the indian state has become so riddled with perverse incentives that accountability is almost impossible
57076 one of the saddest lessons of history is this if weve been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle were no longer interested in finding the truth the bamboozle has captured us it is simply too painful to acknowledge to ourselves that weve been so credulous
57077 the tradition among financiers of profiting from both sides of armed conflict the formula by which war is converted into debt and debt converted back into war
57078 it is nonsensical to consider the institution of a state as a solution to the problem of possible conflict because it is precisely the institution of a state which first makes conflict unavoidable and permanent
57079 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
57080 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
57081 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year

57092 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out

57094 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
57095 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
57096 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed

57098 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
57099 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
57100 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
57101 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
57102 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
57103 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
57104 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
57105 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
57106 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
57107 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
57108 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
57109 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
57110 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
57111 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
57112 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

57129 ye said unto me a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king
57130 and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place and when they forgot the lord their god he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe
57131 and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mothers brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mothers father saying speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i am your bone and your flesh and his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baal berith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons which followed him and he went unto his fathers house at ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left for he hid himself and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem
57132 and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over the trees and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees then said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees then said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon

57150 to coal and iron mines to freight trains to fishing fleets in december to dish washing clothes washing and window washing to road building and tunnel making to foundries and stoke holes and to the frames of skyscrapers would our gilded youths be drafted off according to their choice to get the childishness knocked out of them and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas
57151 they would have paid their blood tax such a conscription with the state of public opinion that would have required it and the many moral fruits it would bear would preserve in the midst of a pacific civilization the manly virtues which the military party is so afraid of seeing disappear in peace
57152 it may seem like a strange moment to make the case for national service for young americans when so many are already doing so much

57160 p eople cannot change their natures but can only change their situations there has been some progress in finding ways of effecting small changes in disorders of personality but management still consists largely of helping the person to find a way of life that conflicts less with his character whatever treatment is used aims should be modest and considerable time should be allowed to achieve them

57221 its not more than a forty minute drive from here
57222 a hot meal is just down the road if youre interested
57223 i live a quarter mile down the road and if i know my housekeeper theres more than enough food for both of us all we have around here are small privately owned shops i guarantee theyre all closed by now youre not going to get anything done tonight
57224 this is a big home do you have a family
57225 my wifes passed away several years ago we have one daughter married
57226 have a two year old grandson johnny hes my buddy chubby cheeks and all what about you
57227 youre welcome to stay the night if you want heaven knows i have the room ill call the tow truck in the morning for you you could rent a car if you want old sam down at the garage could probably have your car fixed by the time you get back from silver lake
57228 another sam huh must be good at what he does
57229 youre a long way from home if you dont mind me asking whats in silver lake
57230 no in chandler i followed a lead to the only living witness in a twenty year old murder
57231 i see i cant imagine its easy piecing old evidence together
57232 the aim is to help young people take the first step into a bright big future
57233 according to the country education fund one in seven young people live in a household where no adult works
57234 thats a damning statistic and we want to help do something about that
57235 another statistic is that only 17 per cent of the national university population comprises students from rural areas and we want to help lift that figure
57236 we want to get kids to take that first step look outside the box and broaden their horizons
57237 a cash handout but will help by paying some of the bills after theyve been incurred
57238 we both intend to vote and it makes it much easier to enrol at school
57239 during this years enrol to vote week we are reminding young people that between federal elections there are by elections and state and local government elections so enrolling to vote is always important
57240 we are reminding students that being enrolled to vote is an ongoing right and responsibility
57241 it is a day for the clients to sit and enjoy and celebrate the birthday its going to be a great day
57242 its really exciting to see hunter day programs in the forefront of new technology
57243 there is money out there i have a calendar of grants for the next three months that is eight pages long
57244 the coal and allied community trust motto is making a difference and we will definitely make a difference in the community
57245 for example singleton council has had a grants officer for three years and she has attracted 1 2 million in that area
57246 if there are five user groups of a certain area they might be able to work together to get larger or more grants than they could on their own
57247 its all about people working together to make things happen
57248 it would be good for me to have a point of contact in each organisation someone who can take charge of the grant writing process
57249 id like to see someone put up their hand particularly if their group is successful gaining money because there needs to be someone responsible for the acquittal process making sure the money is spent as it was said it would be collating that information and sending it back
57250 it might sound involved but its not a huge full time job
57251 if it takes a couple of hours to write an application and your group receives 3 000 its time well spent
57252 time is such a precious resource because were such busy people now and gaining grants far outweighs selling 60 scones at a stall
57253 but at the same time fundraising with scones or the like brings people together and it also can mean a different avenue to gain funding
57254 groups also need to recognise that a lot of grants are matched funding so the fundraising activities can still happen
57255 even in kind donations and volunteering your time can make a big difference because that can potentially attract money
57256 it did its best to keep above 94 us cents but it looks like it just gave way to selling pressure this morning
57257 the real danger for the rba as far as they are concerned is that they dont want to step in too quickly and start cutting rates when there is still inflationary pressures to some extent in the market
57258 they want to be very much certain that a rate cut is warranted
57259 we are of the view that it would be singularly unwise to be committing australian men and women into theatres of operation without a clear understanding why we are going there what and how we are seeking to achieve it and when the job is done and when the men and women are coming home
57260 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
57261 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
57262 sam qualified this moments later when he realised he had been taken out of context
57263 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment
57264 i think it was a slip i understood what he said i didnt take the double meaning in it i understand why people might
57265 i know james brayshaw did and he took it up with sam
57266 im starting to really in some ways sort of question if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair
57267 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think youve got to take him on face value
57268 i know other families have losses some even have the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child but to lose a child to murder shattered ones belief in humanity
57269 the thoughtless and selfish act took tania from us forever and put an end to the bright future that would have been tanias
57270 we have had to endure a journey of hell frustration and pain searing pain that still to this day rips through my body
57271 it todays squad is a great purpose of showing the players that we are very happy with in regards to playing in the world cup and being involved in that australian team
57272 and also for the players that havent been picked and think they should be there its a great opportunity to show over the next six weeks plus semi finals that they have the form to warrant a position in the team

57279 buyers will be stunned at how well this home lives like a detached single family home
57280 the profitability in june is not a fluke management has been employing various strategies that kept the banks ytd net interest margin at 4 19 vs peer group averages of 3 57

57282 the bank is in a very strong capital position with a tier 1 leverage ratio of 22 at june 30 2008 well above the regulatory definition of 5 for a well capitalized institution
57283 having 100 000 winners in july was a huge success viejas casino guests have enjoyed more payouts more often and are having a really fun time with these promotions
57284 viejas loves winners and because of the overwhelming success we are excited to award 100 000 more winners in august
57285 the employer is not bargaining in good faith based on taking nearly 6 months to get to the bargaining table after the election also on a number of items that the union has presented at the table the employer has just said no to everything and will not discuss the issues
57286 the company is showing us the employees a complete lack of respect
57287 we have said we want representation we want guaranteed wages real benefits and to be able to take care of our families it is time fred meyer starts bargaining in good faith with us it is time for us to get a contract
57288 we will continue to pursue the acquisition of the hydroelectric assets and revenues the hydroelectric plants estimated appraised value is 3 million the proposed acquisition cost is estimated to be 500 000 based on 48 monthly payments plus 25 000 000 shares of mopn restricted common stock mopn and bepco have been in agreement regarding the terms of this transaction however there are additional regulatory requirements and other approvals to allow an ongoing transfer of bepco revenues and all the hydroelectric plant assets the proposed acquisition includes revenues real estate equipment license and the utility contract
57289 we are pleased that the alj has determined that there was no violation of section 337 todays ruling maintains continued competition in the marketplace which will benefit american consumers during this time of rising food prices
57290 we are excited to be a part of exterran and are looking forward to taking advantage of the opportunities that exterrans expanded reach and customer relationships provide us we believe this transaction will have a positive impact on our customers our employees and the communities we serve
57291 we are very pleased that an outstanding group of emit employees will be joining the exterran team
57292 emit is an excellent addition to our contract operations business and highly complementary to our existing compression production and processing product lines we will continue to provide the quality service that emits existing customers have relied upon in their coal bed methane operations in the western united states and will also seek to expand these advantageous water processing services into other applicable oil and gas markets throughout the world

57296 our partnership with cca helps strengthen the spiritual bridge that supports many inmates from the time of their incarceration to their return home and beyond
57297 the work of the chauvins significantly impacts those who are directly served as well as those who are often overlooked the children of offenders
57298 the volunteerism of selfless individuals like the chauvins is a testament to ccas strong partnerships with faith based organizations
57299 child evangelism fellowship like the more than six faith based partners with which weve developed strong relationships believes in the power of inmates to change for the better this belief jibes with the daily work of ccas program professionals the addictions treatment managers and counselors educators and instructors and others who change lives one inmate and one day at a time
57300 many inmates are upset with their situation and dont know which way to turn
57301 theyre hunting for anybody who will give them a word theyre looking for some peace
57302 a lot of people reacted to the potential danger they thought wed face being behind bars but i actually feel more comfortable behind bars than i do walking down the street i dont feel the least bit nervous or concerned about my safety

57309 the doctors at cedars are stunned by our little fighter
57310 based on the condition ruby was in when she arrived at the hospital 12 days ago none of them expected her to have come this far in such a short time she has blown them away with her strength and her will to survive
57311 her smile is bright her eyes sparkle and her sense of humor is funnier than ever before
57312 we would like to thank everyone at cedars sinai for their excellent care
57313 their wonderful bedside manner was second to none and helped us tremendously throughout this entire ordeal we want to thank them for everything from the bottom of our hearts
57314 accce is pleased that the epa has recognized the tangible environmental and economic benefits the desert rock project will provide for the four corners
57315 the epa cited desert rocks environmental performance standards as the most stringent in the country and sets a new level of performance for coal fueled power plants
57316 desert rock will use proven emissions control technology to significantly reduce air emissions including particulates mercury and other greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide
57317 as a result the deployment of these technologies coupled with emissions reductions at existing facilities will dramatically improve air quality in the four corners region
57318 perhaps just as important desert rock will responsibly develop navajo resources in the most environmentally sensitive way and help turn these resources into tangible benefits for the navajo people
57319 the construction phase of the project will produce 1 000 jobs over four years and 400 permanent jobs thereafter
57320 the desert rock plant will provide more than 50 million in revenue and payments directly to the navajo nation accounting for roughly 30 percent of their entire budget
57321 technology plays a critical role in allowing coal to burn more cleanly and in turn produce enough electricity to meet our global demand and dramatically reduce emissions
57322 it is important that construction of plants such as desert rock not be hindered to allow for the continued development and deployment of clean coal technologies on a commercial scale and continue the path forward for the industry to achieve its ultimate goal producing electricity affordably and securely with near zero emissions
57323 accce recognizes coal will play a critical role in meeting americas growing energy demand therefore the organization is pleased when decisions are made that allow for the construction of coal fueled power plants to provide affordable electricity for working families in an environmentally sensitive manner
57324 i sat with my daughters in back to back concerts of the new kids on the block

57336 even with oil prices coming off a recent high consumers will be squeezed by high petrol and food prices rising home heating bills come winter and the continuation of the credit crunch until well into 2009
57337 we forecast that sales volumes will contract in july september the first such fall since early 2006 the next 12 months are shaping up to be the slowest period for retailers since the early 1990s
57338 our quarterly surveys have shown that there were 29 profit warnings by general retailers in the first six months of 2008 the highest number of warnings ever recorded by the sector in the first half
57339 in line with deteriorating economic fundamentals we believe even tougher times lie ahead with little evidence of a retail recovery until 2010
57340 the truth is 99 percent of the people involved in coffee commerce from roasters to baristas have never been to a coffee village
57341 is not fancy and does not require a ph d
57342 at the same time coffee companies throughout the united states were making the grossest of gross profits
57343 they could buy the beans for so little without dropping their prices to customers who were so unaware of the economics and true human cost of the trade
57344 this whole thing seemed a horrifying dead end what was at all possible to do here besides make a donation and run screaming home the despair was really sinking in i sat stoically but my great white hope veneer was cracking
57345 thats why the samples were so different the coffee we got last year probably came from different farmers than the ones who grew the samples this year
57346 i think about the blessings in my life that have flowed from this venture
57347 i have been able to travel meet interesting peoples and experience different cultures i get to help people work toward their goals and to top it all off it actually pays the bills

57376 this is not some document to railroad people this allows defense counsel to prepare their clients
57377 each defendant was provided a criminal defense attorney and it was up to those defense attorneys to ensure due process
57378 naiintindihan ko naman na hinahanap nila ang ginawa ko dati pero naging test din naman po sa akin ito na at the end of the day parang siyempre nandoon yung question sa utak ko na baka tinitilian lang nila ako dahil naghubad ako pero alam ko naman po na ang mga taong nagpupunta sa bench fashion show gustong makakita ng naka brief doon ako masaya
57379 okay masayang masaya po ako sa nangyari sa bench siyempre masaya rin ako na masaya ang network ko sa akin napaka weird nung night siyempre ang daming pressures sa lahat ng artista pero masayang masaya po ako sa lahat ng nangyari

57381 what i did is nag 50 50 ako at hindi ako nag overboard tulad ng palagi kong ginagawa pero siyempre ano rin hindi ako magdi disappoint ng mga taong nag aabang naghihintay ng gimmick sa tingin ko hindi ko naman sila nabigo dahil wala naman po akong naririnig na masama
57382 ako po personally hindi po ako nakikipagkumpitensiya kasi ako po bago po ako makipagkumpitensiya gusto ko munang maayos ang trabaho ko bago ko makipag compete sa kanila gusto ko na maayos ko muna ang trabaho ko at yun naman ang tinitingnan ko palagi ang trabaho ko
57383 siyempre meron may healthy competition pero more than anything else ako kasi ayoko ng nakikipagkumpitensiya dahil nakakaragdag lang ng pressure siyempre kapag nagko compete ka masyado kang nagmamadali at the end of the day madarapa ka rin sa kakamadali mo mas mainam na yung iniisip mo lang kung ano ang kailangan mong gawin
57384 basta ako masayang masaya na ako sa naging reaction ng tao sa akin at masaya ako dahil nandoon ang nanay ko tatay ko first time nila kong nakita sa ganoong klase ng environment at pag uwi ko naman proud naman sila sa akin
57385 at maging ang mga tao sa abs they called me they said it was a good show at least daw hindi ako sumobra masaya everyone was happy
57386 may nabasa nga ako sa isang diyaryo na laos na daw kami nina sam milby nina diether ocampo ang sa akin lang hindi ako mag e elaborate kung tinilian ako or hindi
57387 naiintindihan ko naman na hinahanap nila ang ginawa ko dati pero naging test din naman po sa akin ito na at the end of the day parang siyempre nandoon yung question sa utak ko na baka tinitilian lang nila ako dahil naghubad ako
57388 kung meron man nagsasabi na kinarma ako sa bench fashion show nagpapasalamat ako dahil napakaganda ng karma ko nung gabing yun dahil lahat ng gusto kong mangyari ay nangyari nung gabing yun
57389 well all i could say is im happy with what happened with bench i gave my best and i gave my 100 at na appreciate ko po ang suporta ng gabing yun sa araneta

57396 wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled there will her heart her benedictions and her prayers be but she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy she is the well wisher to the freedom and independence of all she is the champion and vindicator only of her own
57397 the great rule of conduct for us in regard to domestic nations is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very remote relation hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities

57415 conference sex is a rarely discussed but very real phenomenon

57451 is a real issue for the millions of americans who are trying to control their weight
57452 obama and mccain are obviously mixtures of both realism and idealism american statesmen have always sought to combine the two in some fashion and they are right to do so a foreign policy that is impractical will fail and one that lacks ideals is unworthy of the united states but the balance that each leader establishes is always different and my main point is that obama seems unusually for a modern day democrat highly respectful of the realist tradition and mccain to an extent unusual for a traditional republican sees the world in moralistic terms in the end the difference between obama and mccain might come down to something beyond ideology temperament mccain is a pessimist about the world seeing it as a dark dangerous place where without the constant and vigorous application of american force evil will triumph obama sees a world that is in many ways going our way as nations develop they become more modern and enmeshed in the international economic and political system to him countries like iran and north korea are holdouts against the tide of history americas job is to push these progressive forces forward using soft power more than hard and to try to get the worlds major powers to solve the worlds major problems call him an optimistic realist or a realistic optimist but dont call him naive

57465 in other iraq news the british government has announced there will be no prosecutions over the death of journalist terry lloyd despite an investigation that blamed us troops terry lloyd was shot dead in iraq in march 2003 along with a french cameraman and an iraqi interpreter two years ago a british coroner ruled that us troops should be prosecuted for the unlawful killing of lloyd who was a well known foreign correspondent for the british television network itn the coroner ruled that lloyd was shot in the back by iraqi soldiers then as he was being driven to a hospital in a civilian minivan lloyd was shot in the head by us troops
57466 coroner andrew walker concluded just under two years ago that terry lloyd was unlawfully killed by american troops and itn has done everything it could to try and ensure terrys killer is brought to justice we are disappointed that the cps has decided they cannot take this matter further and that despite the coroners call on the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions to demand that the americans bring the perpretator of a possible war crime before a british court of law the us authorities remain unco operative

57482 two years ago mr nader came to my high school
57483 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech
57484 i was a freshman and i was in world history class and my class didnt go i guess they thought that ralph didnt fit with world history
57485 yeah but ive been interested in mr nader since then reading about him and i want to help him
57486 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people

57499 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
57500 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
57501 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship

57512 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy sitting next to him repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
57513 when he was attacking him he was calm it was like he was at the beach
57514 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
57515 if an offer was to arrive from arsenal or from abroad we would block the bid
57516 however juventus certainly must be fairer in the evaluation of their players
57517 at the moment they are not giovinco may be young but he must be paid what he deserves
57518 we have a project and we are united to take it forward
57519 the young players are part of our future the old ones so to speak are our present
57520 juventus are the kings of the transfer market as sebastian giovinco drives me crazy
57521 he has amazing qualities he is unpredictable and he works well in the team
57522 he has to be patient at the start and i believe giovinco is juves answer to milans ronaldinho
57523 i saw giovinco last year at empoli and i may be crazy but he is just as good as lionel messi there is not much of a difference between the two
57524 the crime has signs of premeditation mohamed ali called cara to his apartment put the music on high volume and killed her with knife blows he then took her body to the bathroom and then he went off to a party
57525 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
57526 he served really well so it was always going to be a hard match
57527 i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open
57528 for the moment its just all a blur i mean its so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard
57529 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
57530 i dont know what to take out of this match
57531 theres always going to be a nothing match these type of matches it wasnt an olympics or a us open so i can live with that
57532 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
57533 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
57534 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
57535 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes

57541 this research provides a better characterization of the variables at the cellular circuit and behavioral level that contribute to the persistent nature of addictive disorders
57542 the researchers were able to illuminate why drug related memories are so stable
57543 their persistence is highly refractory to new learning which makes our jobs that much tougher and reminds us that treatment must recognize and address the high propensity for relapse almost anywhere down the road
57544 these results indicate that the ltp induced by self administered cocaine is more persistent than that produced by natural rewards such as food and that the ltp is not just a result of exposure to cocaine but also is linked to the drugs effects and the animals learning to obtain the drug
57545 these are important distinctions that will help us better understand how addiction develops and why drugs can overshadow other natural rewards and become the mainstay of an addicted persons life
57546 the clearance of the pathwork test is another step in the continued integration of molecular based medicine into standard practice
57547 in the past scientists have classified different types of cancers based on the organs in which the tumors develop with the help of microarray technology they will be able to classify these types of cancers in a standardized non reader dependent manner based on the patterns of gene activity in the tumor cells
57548 its like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room
57549 it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
57550 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
57551 now that we are learning how these drugs actually work
57552 we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects

57575 im just going to tell you right now and make the prediction vanderbilt will play in the college world series
57576 this kind of stuff todays loss is good for vanderbilt they went the whole year last year as number one and when youre number one the whole time its tough theyre a great team and i know corbin well so i hope he doesnt take this loss hard things went our way today and and i think vanderbilts got one of the best clubs in the country and you guys that are writing the polls and stuff just keep an eye on vanderbilt they didnt make it last year but that was a hiccup theyll be there this year
57577 i was talking to thomas and he was giving me a hard time about how i hadnt been hitting too well
57578 he said if i got above 300 by the time the sec tournament was over then i could shave his head
57579 i didnt realize that i had eclipsed the mark until after the game
57580 thomas saw me and we were just talking about the game and as i was walking off he congratulated me i didnt really know what he was talking about and then he kind of smiled and i figured it out
57581 he took his punishment just like a man and didnt try to get out of it or make any excuses
57582 im going to wear my hat and surprise her when i get home
57583 i think this time of year usually every team has three or four hitters at the top that you fear like we do
57584 but when you get the bottom half of the lineup hitting and contributing the way that they did it adds to the potential of your ball club
57585 if you look at the stats he white hasnt played a whole lot
57586 but as i told the kids this time of year someone who was not a factor during the regular season becomes a factor
57587 i was down about the way we played defense against kentucky
57588 we didnt hit the ball but run prevention has always been the theme in this program
57589 i thought we were going to play defense first and if we got offense fine but i wanted energy and clean baseball in the field and thats what we got
57590 hes just played a lot of games over at first and hes been out in the field in tough situations
57591 yeah he doesnt give you the typical first baseman numbers of 350 20 jacks and 60 rbi but hes alert i like his legs i like his mind and i like his alertness and that just kind of bleeds into the rest of the team
57592 to me its about trying to lessen the run production of the other team while trying to increase the run production of our team its paramount that we play good defense and i think that had a lot to do with the success of the weekend
57593 we werent getting people on base and when we were getting people on base we werent driving them in so i said forget it and lets just bump everyone up
57594 i think its just a matter of getting your best hitters up there and getting them as many at bats as they possibly can because when it really gets down to late in the game you want those guys back up there again
57595 steves a kid who was hitting about 220 for most of the year but it was the hardest 220 i had seen
57596 he was just hitting hard line drives and fly balls all over the place i think hes a good rbi guy he seems to pick up guys when they get on base and hes very aggressive with the bat
57597 my running joke with shea is that i dont need him for offense because he cant hit so just give me defense
57598 ironically all along we recruited him because of his bat and what hes given us in return is a solid bat
57599 as a coach you want to be playing your best ball of the year
57600 weve fought through a lot of adversities earlier in the year with injuries theyre not excuses but theyre thunderbolts and they hit you and knock your team down a little bit and you see how they react to them
57601 i think now were starting to bloom a little bit hopefully were playing our best down the stretch
57602 the feeling of what happened last weekend doesnt really deter where were going to go and what i think were about to do
57603 we need to take on the challenge of trying to win some more ball games down the stretch and try to become the best team we can be at the right time of the year
57604 coach corbin met with us monday and told us to put that series behind us
57605 weve got to learn from that and not let it happen again after fridays win we let a couple of games get away from us and we didnt play our best baseball thats for sure now we all of a sudden have to get ready for a series in knoxville
57606 i gave them two days off because i wanted to get them away from the field for awhile because i felt like a lot of things were piling up on them
57607 they had exams and a lot of things to do and i just felt like giving them a couple of days off at this time of year was the right thing to do sometimes you need that break more than needing to get right back out there so it was time to kind of cool the engines down a little bit
57608 now all of a sudden you become kind of like a pro baseball player where youre spending all your time towards baseball but you have to take care of your time now youve got a little free extra time and can spend it in the weight room or getting extra swings so it should help us
57609 if you dont play your best baseball on a weekend here sec youre done youre cooked because youre not going to have a shot of winning a baseball game
57610 its very difficult it comes down to a pitch an at bat or a play always i know thats been said many times before but its the truth and thats why its said so much
57611 weve got nine games in front of us right now that are very important to finish at the top of the conference and theyre very important in terms of postseason play the first goal is to try to get to birmingham and play in the sec tournament and i think thats paramount right now
57612 if you look at the sec its a tight race and nothings close to being resolved yet
57613 if you look at us our future lies ahead were got three sec weekends left and were playing three teams on our side of the conference that are right with us or ahead of us so these are a big three weeks and we kind of hold our own fate as far as were concerned
57614 no team is just dominating everybody its anybodys game right now and everyone just needs to play their hardest we need to play at the top level of our game in every inning and every out
57615 its a big series with the sec east being all bunched up
57616 its against our rival its instate and theyve kind of been the class of the east over the last couple of years its a big weekend this weeks probably got a little special meaning to it and were looking for it
57617 its just another opponent that you have to play well against in order to get to the next step
57618 outside of that i dont go into a war room and start slamming my fist on a desk saying this is a big rivalry and we got to have this game i dont treat it like that at all i treat it more like any other team we play
57619 i want it to be a heated rivalry and i want it to be great but i dont think its ever going to get to the point where were ever going to cross those lines lifes too short for that
57620 he coached with my mentor coach jack leggett so i have nothing but respect and admiration for tim
57621 there are so many ties between us and vandy that its going to mean more theres no question about it but our kids dont see that so it really doesnt come into play i wont even bring it up to our kids because theyre not getting into that deep with it
57622 we have a lot of common from the standpoint of were both northeast guys and we both worked for a head coach who put us in this position to coach where we are right now
57623 i was very supportive of him getting that job and i felt all along that he would do a great job i just felt like he would bring a mentality and a disposition to those kids that was different i thought once he got things together hed bring in a new energy to them that i think the kids would respond to i think thats been seen and theyve had a lot of good wins
57624 he thrives on getting hit walking or doing something to drive the other team crazy
57625 i think the element that hes added to his game is his ability to hit for extra bases hes driving doubles and hitting the ball out of the ballpark hes doing it from both sides of the plate hes become a very potent dangerous offensive guy
57626 as a leadoff hitter im just trying to get on base
57627 and fortunately im getting good pitches to hit and a couple of home runs have happened here and there
57628 he plays centerfield as well as anyone in this conference
57629 its not because hes a flyer out there its because hes got good instincts he makes good reads on the ball hes alert he can throw runners out
57630 i just go out there in the outfield and play as hard as i can in practice
57631 that way it carries over onto the field to help our pitchers out
57632 here is a guy that has played in the sec for four years and hes never slowed down one step whatsoever hes still laying out during batting practice when nobody is in the stands its what he is use to doing he carries that same mentality to the games
57633 hes hitting home runs stealing bases driving in important runs and making great catches hes doing everything
57634 to tell you the truth when i hit in the cages i tell the pitchers to hit me sometimes so i dont get out of the way when it comes to game time i guess sometimes it is something i work on im the leadoff hitter so i do whatever it takes to get on base to get those guys behind me to drive me in
57635 i just go in the dugout and locker room and be myself and i guess they think its funny and they enjoy it
57636 after sundays game i talked about how we had to break it down to the point were playing pitch by pitch inning by inning and game by game
57637 practicing hard and practicing like you play ultimately it carries over and we got a good week out of it
57638 once everyone starts doing well it just goes throughout the whole team
57639 when we got behind it couldve been a situation where they said oh boy here we go again but it wasnt like that at all
57640 we kept pecking away then when we won and i thought this could turn us around
57641 if you win a series like that youre doing things well
57642 i thought we had a pretty positive approach in all of those games that week
57643 weve got a long way to go we figured out something for the time being but it all starts again this week with lipscomb tuesday
57644 weve been on the road three times weve put them out there in adverse situations
57645 in sundays game the game was 4 3 with one out and the bases loaded
57646 every time we have a moment like that it builds upon itself every time they succeed they get more confidence the next time they go up there on the mound if i dont give them opportunities then i wont know how theyll react in the situation if i give a guy an opportunity like that and he reacts well to it then hell get the ball again in that same situation
57647 he never went down on the ground after being hit by the pitch and his face was all over the place
57648 hes your grinder hes your phil garner hes your guy whos just a battler and never takes no for an answer
57649 his injury is a loss because theres a confidence level he plays with that goes to our team the kid wants to play right now but hes not going to play for another two weeks
57650 i sincerely want to thank everyone who has supported me since my injury on saturday
57651 the cards i have received really mean a lot to me and i just want everyone to know that i am doing well and should be back in action soon
57652 im seeing somebody that wants the ball earlier in the year she didnt want to make the tough shot she didnt know that was going to be her role now she knows thats her role she wants the basketball she can find different ways to score tonight you saw her drive she got to the free throw line because they kentucky took her three point shot away which is what she has done so well she has been money from 3 and shooting very well she put it on the floor and then she also went into the paint and posted you saw her make post moves with her back to the basket she has all three things and its nice to have a player that is that complete especially as a junior she has other weapons to go through but also want to take and make the big shot
57653 christina really enjoys assists she really enjoys the team getting assists we were stressing so much ball movement sharing the basketball and running the offense now she has figured out that she is the best option to take it no matter where the ball is in the offense she has been more aggressive to get more shots that was really important early in the season she wasnt aggressive enough if the shot came to her she let the game come to her a little too much now shes going out to get the game
57654 i just like to win and it doesnt matter how
57655 i think we learned our lessons and its helped us to mature
57656 we went through some hard times and its helped us find out who we are and that makes us more determined to show what we can do
57657 i thought this team could be the best defensive team that weve had and we just werent doing that early
57658 i think we really can play a very high level of defense and rebound where our teams in the past were known to outscore people i think weve changed were just different
57659 were spending more time practicing defense then we ever have and thats because its something i thought would be the strength of our team
57660 nobodys talking about us and with a young team its not a problem
57661 our goal is to keep improving all season and to be the best team we can be in march i know the potential is there and right now the attitude and effort are there and were just building confidence
57662 even if you dont drive a 180 mph like i do its still risky driving with an allergy medicine that can cause drowsiness
57663 that was superb i was wrong and it was worth it i always liked boston people better when they felt bitter and unlucky
57664 i just realized that jared lorenzen is going to own a super bowl ring he can also use it as a cookie cutter
57665 i have a blue house with a blue window blue is the color of all that i wear blue are the streets and all the trees are too
57666 its a great honor to be 15 0 right now but we still havent played our best game yet thats something we have to strive for the umass game was a great game but we still had 20 turnovers we had some defensive breakdowns hear and there so that definitely gives us something to work towards and continue to get better at
57667 our main goal is to stay humble and hungry we need to realize that although our record is perfection thats not the way were playing unfortunately in a way its good because were able to win in situations where were not playing our best basketball as a senior ive been here when we havent played our best basketball and we lost its definitely a humbling experience and it makes us strive for perfection
57668 i think last year taught us that if we stay together then anything is possible especially with four seniors and everyone that was on last years team we take a great deal of confidence from winning in late game situations we feel like were the best team in the country whenever the game is close and that gives us confidence even when were not playing our best basketball or blowing opponents out we have a great deal of confidence were going to win
57669 i think its good for us because it will force us to continue to get better and bring our a game every night whenever you have teams going to play their best every night it forces us to be better both as a player and as a team
57670 we keep on them and make sure everyone stays humble and keeps their eyes on our goals we set for our team we need to keep getting better every single day as long as we do that like we did last year we will reach our potential whatever that may be things are looking pretty good so far
57671 they can look back in previous years for the last two years the ncaa champion has been florida that should tell you right there how strong our conference is its one of the toughest conferences in america every night is going to be a fight there are no easy games or giveaways everything is going to be a grind from here on out

57780 in photos there appeared to be a beak it was just a tricky angle its a dead raccoon thats what it is its undoubtedly a raccoon the same teeth paws the right size

57944 today i keep riding because i love maintaining my level of fitness and i have fun doing it
57945 i like the high end equipment because its very light more dependable and if youre having fun using it and not breaking down you will use it more often
57946 some people have too much fun overdo it and overextend their bodies
57947 i dont ride any more or less since gas prices got high
57948 theres a whole lot of talk but not a huge upswing in purchases
57949 but as time goes on they anticipate an upswing in purchases
57950 i will go back and tell them we are still up in the air on what to do
57951 is there any assurance from the purchaser that theyre not going to develop the land
57952 you could get mineral rights but it development lessens the value of that
57953 theres only one reason why people ride bicycles in this country recreation
57954 in other countries people look at it as a means of moving around
57955 by and large many of the people coming here are leisure type riders
57956 people are riding it not only for the beauty of the trail but also for the exercise
57957 more and more as they become more aware of their health and the need to exercise they realize how beneficial cycling is
57958 we see people who are coerced into it riding by their friends have a good time and figure ill give it a try
57959 for the inner city bike shops there is talk about more bike sales for commuting
57960 motor homes travel trailers boats or other recreational vehicles or trailers shall not be stored or parked outdoors in a front or side yard for more than 14 days

57963 id always ridden bicycles before but thats when i started commuting
57964 with gas the way it is 35 miles round trip thats 6 to 8 a day at 3 to 4 a gallon

57968 the core of microsoft growth is based around office the server products and sharepoint i think this is a huge announcement in terms of giving people the ability to choose
57969 we wanted to eliminate the advantage microsoft has with the office monopoly and this eliminates that advantage for microsoft because now a user can choose to use alfresco as easily as they would choose to use sharepoint
57970 if he beats his chest and says we are not playing fair or whatever like this is some closed secret of microsoft then i think that proves that sharepoint is the worse product but if its really as good a product as they say then should not be ashamed to have it compete fairly with alfresco
57971 theyre able to leverage other infrastructure investments in data centers maybe the java world maybe linux to be able to deploy a much more cost effective and scalable solution to meet their content management needs

57975 hekhsher tzedek is a holistic celebration of jewish tradition uniting ethical practice with ritual observance in the production of jewish food
57976 jewish law is concerned not only about the smoothness of a cows lung but also about the safety of a workers hand as well as the impact that kosher food production has on the environment hekhsher tzedek grows out of jewish tradition it does not seek to redefine kashrut as much as enhance it

57985 its a tight labor market with wages at least 21 percent higher overall now than before katrina

57995 i try to find out whats going on with each patient as scientifically as i can
57996 the training for an allergist really allows them to improve the life of a patient
57997 these patients were able to lead lives without the impact of allergic symptoms and without the use of daily medications to control allergic symptoms
57998 people were all over but they would find me and call for medical advice
57999 one day my son called me up and said someone is trying to get in touch with you theres comment on nola com from one of your patients looking for you
58000 they are just a really loyal and energetic group of people
58001 four of our office staff lost everything but they were here to get us up and running
58002 things are more stable now and starting to grow maybe its not in the numbers yet but things are improving
58003 i just fell in love with the whole way of life
58004 then i took a job as an orderly at west jefferson for a summer i got really interested in the technical side of cardiology
58005 back then there wasnt much you could do for heart attacks

58007 now we can save their life and were doing it every day
58008 ive learned the tricks to find safe and effective solutions
58009 ive had experience with a lot of complicated procedures and seen so many variations of these complicated and life threatening conditions
58010 he was being shocked up to four times a day these defibrillators dont prevent the rhythm from happening they just shock you out of it
58011 it got to the point where they were discussing dnr a
58012 they worked hard to guarantee salaries to keep faculty here that was tough when theres no revenue in the city its really tough to keep a practice going
58013 i thought that people should come back to new orleans to help with the redevelopment of the medical center at louisiana state university and the rebirth of new orleans
58014 the people here are some of the best people so i wanted to come back to do something for new orleans
58015 when i was growing up in a small town in west virginia my family and i had a wonderful family physician who really influenced me to become a doctor
58016 i would talk to him about what it was like to be a doctor he encouraged me and told me that it was the best thing to do because it was always interesting not only could you learn a lot but you could help people in a very direct way
58017 it involves everything that makes us human what allows us to reason be awake and solve problems
58018 there was a young woman who developed guillain barr syndrome
58019 actually she was engaged to be married to a pathology resident just a few months later
58020 so she was in the icu couldnt move and on a ventilator months before she was getting married
58021 the team worked together and diagnosed her condition and treated her over the next two or three months she made a full recovery despite some weakness in her feet
58022 it was actually reassuring she was a young woman in her early 20s and this couldve killed her or she couldve been severely disabled but we treated her and she was able to go and get married and have a nice life
58023 i think we need to rethink the way we deliver healthcare the access to it the quality of it
58024 i dont suppose that i have all the answers but i am always willing to listen to other peoples ideas
58025 if you or a loved one needed a doctor in your specialty and you couldnt treat them yourself to whom would you refer them
58026 best doctors never takes compensation of any kind from doctors or hospitals in return for listing doctors in its database nor does best doctors pay doctors to participate in its survey process
58027 doctors displaced and or relocated due to hurricane katrina have been updated to the best of our ability unless significant changes occur in a doctors practice doctors who relocate retain their best doctors status when they change geographical locations any doctors we have been unable to locate remain in our database for further research but were removed from the list submitted due to their inaccessibility to your readers all doctors we were able to locate were sent voting invitations for the best doctors 2007 2008 review
58028 veterans of the work camps and barrelhouses who didnt tickle the keys they crushed them the trick was to make yourself heard and the best way to do that was to play and sing loud to hammer out the beat with your left hand and not try anything with your right to put the beat in front where it belonged and keep it there all night
58029 we can control all variables all facets everything will meet our standards
58030 the city and the people have been beaten down here is something positive a center delivering the highest standard drawing people from los angeles boston israel theres a little spark maybe that means something

58041 dr lutz committed malpractice and caused damages to my client
58042 failed to inform the plaintiff that blood tests including mean corpuscular volume mean corpuscular hemoglobin and platelet levels were abnormal as a result of the malpractice of dr lutz the plaintiff has been placed at an increased risk of thrombosis stroke heart attack leukemia hemorrhage myelofibrosis and other diseases and conditions
58043 perhaps no other situation in clinical medicine has caused otherwise astute physicians to intervene inappropriately more often than thrombocytosis it is commonly believed that a high platelet count must cause intravascular stasis and thrombosis however no controlled clinical study has ever established either association the focus should be on the patient not the platelet count
58044 should have discussed an abnormal finding with the patient but that not discussing the result did not cause the patient any damages
58045 as a result of the panel opinion plaintiff will likely file suit in the near future
58046 please be advised that dr lutz is not interested in settling this matter i look forward to seeing you at the upcoming trial
58047 the jury did not believe that that durante had proven any damages your records could have been better but we didnt think you did anything wrong

58092 and what ive noticed about doctors is that when you go to see something and they treat you for something they make money everyone wants to make money especially people whove gone to school for an extra eight years to make that money so oftentimes doctors will prescribe things to you that arent entirely necessary

58099 i think the trinamool leaders and others opposing must understand the implications of their agitation the state government is always ready to talk to them so that we can have an amicable solution on this issue and we are not averse to any discussion to settle the matter the government will see that construction goes smoothly and the state government will leave no stone unturned to maintain the law and order situation there
58100 tell me what you eat and i will tell you what you are
58101 the man of the family the one that people could lean on even though i was 11 i cried once maybe twice then i closed the book and that was it
58102 the minute he died i stopped crying because i became a man and thats what made me strong enough to be a successful racer
58103 had he been alive i dont think i would have had the freedom to do my career the way i wanted to have done it
58104 he was a very strong character it would have still been his career in his mind
58105 that could have pushed me away from racing had he been alive because ive always been a very independent person
58106 when your name already exists you get to your first race people expect you to get the pole and to win the eyes are already on you
58107 it can make you a lot stronger make you more independent make you work under pressure so it gets you used to that
58108 so you either become very good very quickly or you disappear within six months and you just lose it
58109 when i was in champ car and started f1 nascar was for the most part nonexistent for most people that i knew
58110 when youre a young driver you either are a sports car driver nascar driver or an open wheel racer youre very stuck up with that mentality and nothing else exists and youre above that
58111 only once youve become a professional racer and youve done it for a while then you really open your eyes to everything that exists and it is easier for you to determine what is good and what is bad and why it is good and why it is bad
58112 i was starting to think of how to do it
58113 f1 is the top level of one kind of racing nascar is totally different but it is the top level of that kind of racing
58114 i knew they were good i just didnt know how good they were
58115 before getting on the track when you see how close everybody is together then you tell yourself that even the average guy is pretty good
58116 in nascar there are extremely good drivers very good drivers good drivers and maybe one or two average drivers
58117 you dont have the paid drivers like you have in f1 that makes it extremely competitive
58118 they werent actually that mean they were very sound comments
58119 i guess they expected me to be angry about them because i come from f1 they were a tenth of what the comments would have been in f1 for a similar situation
58120 drivers would come to me and ask why i wanted to drive stock cars after driving those amazing cars mainly because they would want to drive an f1 car like it is for juan pablo montoya its more exciting for us to drive these cars right now once youve done something for so long you want to know what the rest is
58121 at first there was some doubt about why i was wanting to do it
58122 was i really still passionate about racing now they see that i am really working hard on that
58123 there are a lot of other things that i could do i could race in europe i could make a lot of money racing other things
58124 thats been my life not because i dont have any other interest in life i have a lot of things i love in life but thats what im good at
58125 its a road course its not useful in nascar because theres hardly any road courses teams really dont care if a driver is good on a road course
58126 this is home and if i didnt do it that would also have a negative effect because i would be a snob
58127 i love racing it will be a big crowd whatever happens ill be having fun and ill be going for it
58128 when i make a decision then ill carry it for as long as it can possibly be carried ill make it happen but you cant control 100 percent of your destiny
58129 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
58130 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
58131 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
58132 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
58133 i went back to the room after meetings heard it saw it just kind of chuckled because i have no idea where it came from i have no idea where those stories come from
58134 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
58135 i thought that would be something they wouldnt do or try to stay away from as far as here i like the guys we have behind centre right now in kyle and rex and i think those guys can definitely take us through

58138 i think theres nothing at all good about it save the field of wheat the mountain the orchard the olives with the blue hills and the portrait and the entrance to the quarry and the rest says nothing to me because it lacks individual intention and feeling in the lines
58139 that head of his has been occupied with contemporary societys insoluble problems for so long and he is still battling on with his good heartedness and boundless energy his efforts have not been in vain but he will probably not live to see them come to fruition for by the time people understand what he is saying in his paintings it will be too late
58140 the olive grove with a white cloud and a background of mountains as well as the moonrise and the night effect the starry night are exaggerations from the point of view of arrangement their lines are warped as in old wood

58175 the hike in fares and atf prices on thursday is unrelated and it is purely due to commercial reasons
58176 definitely the fares will go up the airlines feel that the market can still take an increase of 10 per cent in fares maybe the low cost carriers stay away from raising fares but full service carriers fares will go up
58177 we did expect a marginal hike in atf prices and thats what it has been though the oil prices had cooled down in the last week or so the average price of oil still remained on the higher side and so this hike was natural however if the price holds at these levels we do expect atf price to come down next month
58178 we are not taking any decision on fuel surcharge increase as of today thursday we would like to wait for a couple of days and since the hike has been marginal probably its impact would also not be much however we would wait till monday

58273 initially williams was brought in to run the campaign even though solis doyle was still there the result was confusion for the staff who werent sure who was really in charge the source said

58285 only two things really matter and they matter a great deal the first is foreign policy the lines are clearly drawn mccain would continue what he sees as a long war against terrorism until it is won obama or clinton would pull our troops out of iraq immediately and rely on a series of conversations with the likes of to produce peace for our time
58286 scrapping the existing zero and reduced rates of vat perfectly consistent with eu rules would raise around gbp23bn if gbp12bn of this extra revenue were spent increasing means tested benefit and tax credit rates by 15 this would leave the poorest three tenths of the population better off on average while still raising gbp11bn to cut other taxes or to spend in other ways
58287 it would also have only a modest and temporary effect on inflation increasing the non housing retail prices index by around 0
58288 a stronger argument for having different vat rates on different goods and services is that the government should impose a lower rate on work related items such as commuting costs and a higher rate on leisure related ones so as to offset the overall disincentive to work created by taxation
58289 however the study suggests that we cannot be confident that the potential efficiency gains from differentiating vat rates in this way would outweigh the costs of greater complexity and the advantage of a single rate in making it easier to resist political pressure to provide favourable treatment to particular sectors or items
58290 the study also argues that the government should urge its fellow member states to remove a range of outdated exemptions under the common eu vat rules notably in respect of financial services given this freedom one potentially attractive though as yet untried reform would be to treat all cash inflows into financial services companies as vat able sales by them and all outflows as purchases while zero rating transactions with registered businesses
58291 removing exemptions in the financial and other sectors would raise revenue for the government cut compliance and administration costs and reduce distortions to competition and trade that are likely to become increasingly problematic
58292 action at the eu level is also required to provide a lasting solution to
58293 given that smokers die early saving the rest of society a considerable sum in pension and old age care costs it is far from clear that the current high rate of tobacco duty can be justified on the grounds of the external costs of smoking but given peoples lack of self control and tendency to take decisions today that they will regret tomorrow high rates of tobacco duty may be appropriate to help protect people from the consequences of their own decisions
58294 high levels of alcohol duty may be justified by the cost of drink driving and other criminal behaviour but it is not a particularly well targeted policy duty levels high enough to curb abusive drinking by a minority impose significant welfare costs on the majority of non abusive drinkers
58295 differences in the external costs of drinking and smoking from country to country suggest that it would not be desirable to impose uniform levels of excise duties across the eu but big differences in duty rates do encourage smuggling and tax evasion which in turn encourages countries to set relatively low rates this suggests that it would be sensible to increase the existing floors on excise duties imposed by the eu to a level which would help prevent inefficient downward pressure on duty rates
58296 vat is widely recognised as one of the most efficient taxes in the policymakers armoury but these contributions to the mirrlees review suggest that there are real improvements to be made both through domestic reform and efforts to change eu rules

58300 this is the right thing to do for our country during this economic downturn this law expands and improves the low income housing tax credit which is the largest source of federal support for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing it also increases volume limits on housing bonds to finance low income rental housing and first time homebuyers while also providing states with greater flexibility on how to use those bonds efficiently
58301 i also want to thank treasury secretary henry paulson who worked closely with democrats in congress to pass this legislation and ensured that the president would sign it into law

58361 we knew at the time that really the nascar brand was nonexistent in the mexico market and we were starting from scratch
58362 the race in mexico city was part of nascar s overall expansion into the southwest and in particular was meant to expose the sport more directly to the hispanic community i think it succeeded in that primary purpose

58435 i am in receipt of a communication from the department of state advising me that there is to be held in europe an international zionist conference it is not stated when or where this conference will be held but i believe that it will be highly desirable to obtain some information concerning the same and i am communicating this information to you in order that you may possibly communicate with the military attach abroad for obtaining definite information as to the transactions of this conference
58436 the recent emphasis in american public opinion placed on the part of the jews have been taking in world events has seemed to warrant the state department in undertaking a preliminary study of the particular matters in controversy and also the larger question of the scope of jewish influence in world affairs among the more important points around which controversy has raged are the various phases of the polish question a whether the jewish anti polish propaganda in the united states has been based on actual widespread jewish pogroms in poland or b whether on the contrary the stories of pogroms have been greatly exaggerated as a part of deliberate zionist propaganda to get for the jews in poland minority rights which both factions of american poles publicly denounce as amounting to the creation of a state within a state the important thing for us however is the fact that americans in the main do not sense the situation nor appreciate its dangerous possibilities
58437 of the german commissaries commissars 25 out of 32 are jews the early efforts of the bolsheviki to get control in russia were financed by the german imperial government largely through the german jewish banking firm of m n warburg and company of hamburg practically all of the men who participated in the negotiations with the bolsheviki in turning over these funds were jews
58438 we have mentioned several times the disagreeable fact that the russian bolsheviks were jews these jews are at the present moment in control of the russian government and they have powerful friends in all the allied countries who are helping them we have appealed to the british jews but appealed so far in vain to disassociate themselves formally from a cause which is doing the jewish people terrible harm in all parts of the world in reply the jewish press shower upon us not only abuse but threats
58439 when dr simons formerly a resident of russia made the statement that 90 of the bolsheviks in new york were jews the entire radical element rose in arms and vilified a man whose only crime was being too modest in his calculations i am satisfied that instead of 90 it should be nearer the actual amount to say that 95 of the bolsheviks were jews only recently i had the opportunity to look over the records of one soviet branch in new york out of a membership of 700 625 were jews
58440 a number of men in positions of power commissars in the cities here and there in russia had lived in america
58441 it is true that there have been some outbreaks against the jews for special reasons due to upset conditions and tales about jewish profiteering particularly from russian bolshevik jews who are trying to upset the polish national spirit i remark with wonder that the leaders of americas greatest jewish societies are lending themselves to this movement for all the agitation in america is only helping germany and bolshevik russia whenever one jew has been hurt in poland jews say ten were killed and germans say a thousand if a jew is killed in conflict like the jews in vilna or vilnius lithuania was then a part of poland who fought against the bolsheviki the press immediately spreads a tale of a polish pogrom
58442 in its horror and system the acts recalled the worst epochs of the middle ages
58443 a bitter and vituperative attack on mr gibson charging that gibsons report is necessarily based on merest hearsay parroting repetition of what has been told him in court circles
58444 it seems quite possible that these jewish leaders realized that an honest report would destroy the ammunition for their anti polish propaganda and show up more strikingly the utter unfairness of the attack on mr gibsons confirmation
58445 jewish employers in america have discharged polish workmen and jewish landlords have evicted polish tenants
58446 have the jewish zionists as a part of a definite propaganda campaign to get for the jews of poland minority rights deliberately exaggerated the stories of pogroms in poland the bill of rights adopted at the american jewish congress at philadelphia on december 19 1918 requested the peace conference to grant to the jews in new or enlarged states to be created by the conference autonomous management of all jewish communal institutions and insisted that such autonomy be a condition precedent to the creation of any such state poland being the largest and most important new state thus to be formed it was natural that jews should center their efforts on establishing the principle there to quote from one of their own number israel cohen in the washington post may 30 1919 there is only one way in which the civil equality of the jews can be preserved and that is by their being given the rights of a national minority the jews should be given autonomy as far as the administration of their religious cultural social and charitable affairs are concerned but they should also be constituted a separate electoral college with the right to proportional representation in the polish parliament
58447 the army is very largely composed of poles upon the passage of the draft law 90 of the jews of the country called for what is known as the blue ticket which is an exemption certificate given to those who are aliens incidentally this has an important political bearing as being an official announcement by 90 of the polish jews that they consider themselves not poles but jews per se
58448 a careful reading of the prominent articles concerning alleged atrocities began appearing simultaneously in the leading american papers shows a striking similarity in form in substance in form in substance and in headlines a similarity so striking as to have no other reasonable explanation than that of a thoroughly planned propaganda confidential dispatches from copenhagen describe a german inspired organization abroad to supply news of pogroms for publication in the american jewish press
58449 contrast this with the statement of rabbi tittlebaum concerning the persecution of the jews of southern russia in which he tells of the killing and wounding of thousands 5000 being killed in the town of proscorof alone there has been little publicity about this in the united states probably because it would defeat the purposes of the zionist propaganda as showing the outbreaks against the jews in poland were more restrained and acceptable by much less loss of life than those in other places where chaotic conditions prevailed such as southern russia
58450 were killed in the house to house fighting by which the poles took the city from the bolsheviki
58451 it should be noted that both judge mack and mr marshall as well as jacob schiff are all members of the executive committee of the jewish kehillah in new york which committee has as its chairman rabbi judah l magnus an open and avowed advocate of bolshevism both in russia and the united states as to the kehillah itself while it is ostensibly interested solely in jewish community work some question has been raised to its alleged pro bolshevik tendencies
58452 an attempt by the jews to prejudice americans against the new polish government
58453 the fact is not that the jews wish well to the new state but that the jews are at this moment using all their keen intellectual activity and their deep racial loyalty working all over the world at high pressure to prevent the new polish state coming into existence at all
58454 as a result of the publicity given these jewish and weimar german inspired anti polish protests both in this country and abroad the poles were defeated and the combined jewish committee of the world headed by mr louis marshall were able to secure 1 the special provisions set out in the polish treaty and 2 the general acquiescence in these provisions on the part of the american press the american poles however are more bitter than ever in their denouncement of these articles as undemocratic and un american
58455 the poles privately maintain that the jews are disappointed in the development of poland into a free and independent nation as the situation of jewish leaders for many generations has been to make of poland a jewish economic state commanding the commercial and financial channels of eastern europe
58456 that the treatment of the jews by the poles is liberal and humane and is proved not only by the dispatches of our representatives but by the testimony of many polish jews themselves only the other day we received a letter from a prominent polish jew warmly protesting against the anti polish propaganda which we can assure those engaged it if is doing great injury to their polish co religionists he described how the imperial and later weimar germans had for 100 years followed a policy of setting the polish jews against the christian poles and had even gone so far as to force polish jews to take derisory german names which are even now he argues a great obstacle in the way of assimilation he asserted that they polish jews desire to take polish names and cooperate with the christian poles in creating a polish nation
58457 but they cannot hope to do this as long as jewish nationalists zionists and german propagandists stir up the jews against the poles and the poles against the jews those english jews therefore who are carrying on propaganda against poland are doing very ill service to their kindred in that country the british foreign office is being used by these jewish zionist propagandists to harass and insult poland at this most critical and dangerous time
58458 during the bolshevik advance july august 1920 all the parties except a small communist group rallied to the support of the polish government the communist party is believed probably with much right to be led by younger jewish elements especially by the russian jews as opposed to those who have lived for centuries in poland the preponderant role of the jew in bolshevik russia is realized even by the most ignorant polish peasant during the critical days of july and august military gendarmes patrolled the streets of warsaw all day and night those not having the proper papers were arrested formed into squads and marched out to work on the trenches if they appeared to be deserters they were sent to prison anyone who saw these squads could not fail to remark that 90 were jews
58459 undoubtedly there were many jews who joined the polish army and fought as poles but the fact remains that to the polish soldier and to the polish population the small percentage of jews at the front to those who were not there was evident on every side as to stories of wholesale pillaging of the jews they are often true the pole and all other soldiers in this part of the world live as in medieval times largely by pillaging but the jew was probably less pillaged than the peasant from all evidence at hand it is my belief that in general the jews at first welcomed the bolsheviks in some cases they went out to meet the invader with bands
58460 how far sighted were our wise men of old when they said that to attain a serious object one must not stop at the means nor should one count the victims sacrificed to the cause we have not counted the victims from among the goys those seeds of cattle although we have sacrificed many of our own we have already given them in return an undreamed of position on earth the comparatively small number of victims from among our own people has been a guarantee from destruction

58519 tax havens can also facilitate investment by allowing investors to reduce their tax burdens
58520 love one another as i have loved you so you must love one another
58521 we for confirms on mars dragonflytv phoenix discovery surveyor mission phoenix lander guide
58522 everthing i know i learned from tv philosophy for the unrepentant couch potato
58523 all i can is that we are proud of that commercial we think americans need to know that i believe that we should base this campaign on what we can do for americans here at home and how we can make america safe and prosperous and thats the theme of our campaign
58524 it wasnt too long ago that sen mccain and his campaign were talking about straight talk and civility and pledging to run a respectful campaign based solely on the issues sadly each and every day each and every hour they seem to take a turn in what the st pete times said today in an editorial that the straight talk express has taken a turn into the gutter it seems like we hit a new low note every day with this campaign
58525 weve got people struggling with high gas prices with wage stagnation rising health care costs weve got growing security concerns in afghanistan this is an election and moment of great consequence and john mccain unfortunately seems to have made a strategic decision to rather than engage as the focus of his campaign on these substantive issues character assaults and negative advertisements and this is not the john mccain the voters thought they were going to see in this presidential campaign
58526 correct mistruths that are put out by the mccain campaign
58527 and unfortunately its probably going to be something that were updating with great frequency every day
58528 given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and health care and jobs and our foreign policy youd think that wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i mean i do i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this elections about is that what is worthy of the american people
58529 im not interested in getting into a tit for tat these negative ads these negative attacks spending all this time talking about me and instead of talking about what hes going to do thats not going to lower your gas prices thats not going to help you stay in your home if youre falling behind on the mortgage thats not going to help you find a job if its been shipped overseas it doesnt do a single thing to help the american people its politics as a game but the time for game playing is over thats why im running for president of the united states
58530 i would say that is it beyond dispute that he has become the biggest celebrity in the world its a statement of fact its backed up by the reality of his tour around the world he has many fans the question that we are posing to the american people is this is he ready to lead yet and the answer to the question that we will offer to the american people is no that he is not
58531 the point we are making if it hasnt escaped anybody is that you know these images of celebrity status and the way he has conducted his campaign to date both in the kinds of events that he has and what he says at these events owe more to the development of an international celebrity status than it does to a traditional campaign for president
58532 maybe thats what the obama campaign has intended and we think it is worthy of some attention by our campaign in the early aspects of the ad we have images of other celebrities that demonstrate that the focus of the obama campaign has been as much to create that celebrity status of his as it is to discuss the hard issues that the american public are forced to debate during the course of this campaign
58533 i would add my voice to those who believe that sen mccain cant possibly mean this because he has been a great public servant and a real genuine american hero i suspect that he is under pressure to take steps like this because he is showing in many ways that the republican party and he doesnt mean to do this but that it is a party that is running out of ideas
58534 its probably premature to speculate although sometimes it is fun to speculate
58535 the dynamic that is out there right now some would say its a slim chance that tim kaine would be the pick but if it were the decision between bob mcdonnell and bill bolling would have a different dynamic i guess so obviously thats something to speculate about
58536 but with him running again for that position i really had no interest in challenging him
58537 i still consider myself very much a republican and a leader here in the republican cause there have been some issues here locally that will just have to be sorted out over time but i dont intend to push the issue
58538 we as republicans would be better served if we just focused on working to elect republicans bob goodlatte locally for congress and john mccain nationally having that common goal will bring us together in effect there really is i guess no reason for us to be sidetracked with these intraparty differences that will be sorted out at some point but right now i think the more people who subscribe to the republican party platform are willing to support republican party candidates thats what its all about so hopefully thats what everyone will be doing that like to think of themselves as conservatives and support the platform of the republican party
58539 i think what will have to do over time is work on getting along and supporting all republicans and doing it in a positive way yeah there are still some rumblings out there there are some that because of the efforts against me that consider me the enemy i dont envision myself in that way i think we just need to keep our roots deep and broad so that we can build the party
58540 mountain valley republicanism has been around for a long time and it has stood the test of time in that its conservative but it also has a strong element of common sense associated with it and it also has to do with demeanor you dont have to be mean about it you dont have to be in anybodys face just speak to your issues and be consistent
58541 there are some that think being conservative is being anti government i dont think that could be further from the truth
58542 i think we should be proud really of our country and the government that allows us to create the opportunities that it has
58543 i dont believe that but what i do believe is occasionally we have to refocus on those elements that make us a great nation and certainly our constitution which provides the underpinnings is a significant part of that but its also the people so we collectively need to get our act together because our government at any one point in time is a reflection of all of us
58544 i know baby now get under the table right now
58545 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness
58546 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
58547 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
58548 this is very rare unique occurrence bus transportation is one of the safest modes of transportation this is highly unique that something like this happened
58549 our drivers are trained to provide the safest travel for all our passengers and every time an incident occurs they know to pull the bus over and call 911
58550 were never closed to looking at how canadians can be more safe and more secure
58551 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare
58552 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
58553 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
58554 i dont think the guy knew him at all i think he was really crazy the poor guy he didnt see it coming
58555 i felt bad that all the young people and old people had to see that
58556 the first thing i heard was something like a terrible type of yowl and that was from the guy who got stabbed
58557 my daughter said oh my god and everybody else started screaming
58558 we are going to do whatever we need to provide the passengers with counselling or any other measures to make sure theyre taken care of
58559 well the rural nature of our network doesnt allow us to have airport style security doesnt make it practical for us to do that were working with transport canada to review inner city bus security
58560 were working with them to make things as safe as possible
58561 and now i have a word for you who brashly announce
58562 if the master wills it and were still alive well do this or that
58563 as it is you are full of your grandiose selves all such vaunting self importance is evil in fact if you know the right thing to do and dont do it that for you is evil
58564 hey ive got an idea how about we go to our pharmacy benefit management division and get the medical profiles of our members and prospective sub here
58565 i dont think you can boot russia out of the g 8
58566 you have to ask how did they get there in the first place
58567 i dont see the europeans joining because it would undercut the u n ultimately it will go nowhere
58568 we are looking forward to bringing tna wrestling to dublin for the first time and playing a venue with such an incredible history
58569 wrestling is about so much more than what happens inside the ring
58570 with the tna mobile game fans will get to experience and control the action both in and out of the ring
58571 tna is consistently searching out new media platforms to better serve our fans worldwide and mobile gaming will put our brand at the cutting edge of gaming

58578 it took just a few months after the united states invasion of iraq for the world to find out that saddam hussein had long abandoned his nuclear biological and chemical weapons programs he was not training terrorists or colluding with al qaeda the only real threat he posed was to his own countrymen
58579 we cannot say with certainty whether mr bush lied about iraq but when the president withholds vital information from the public or leads them to believe things that he knows are not true to justify the invasion of another country that is bad enough
58580 thats bad dont do that again now eat your spinach
58581 i have seen some strange things recently such as stray dogs snatching bites out of bodies lying on the streets
58582 there is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people

58596 the fact that mr rupert may or may not have a shady background depending on your point of view and the fact that as a paid agent he might be suspect as a witness at any rate are neither here nor there
58597 brennans continued detention without bond appears to serve no end that is consistent with the interest of the united states to foster a lasting peace in northern ireland
58598 and provisions in the law to waive his prior unlawful presence in the us mr brennan ought to be granted the opportunity to contest the charge of removal with the privilege of release on bond
58599 his continued detention is not justified for the security of the united states or its people nor is he a flight risk
58600 investigations will be put on hold until a decision on this application has been made
58601 the best appointed constituency office of any party in north antrim if not further afield
58602 the fact that mr rupert may or may not have a shady background depending on your point of view and the fact that as a paid agent he might be suspect as a witness at any rate are neither here nor there
58603 yeah ishmael went down with all his buddies and got drunk so he hasnt come back yet
58604 mark hearing gods word from the roots up has really been an amazing thing now i am gods kid and whenever i see others from other villages that dont know we always get into conversations about god and his word
58605 mark they are just so very confused like we were when you guys first came in here to live with us
58606 i joined in their conversation and i turned it around to talking about god and his word they had so many questions for me when i talked they just sat there with their mouths open they could not believe what they were hearing
58607 mark i just started right back in the beginning with adam and eve and told them the old testament stories then i told them about the old testament sacrifices that the people had to do and then about how jesus christ was the last sacrifice it was so much fun by the time we were done talking we had talked for four hours together
58608 i thought this man has the holy spirit in his life to teach and to guide him and he is taking gods talk wherever he goes
58609 and to think that in my weak faith i did not trust that he could stay away from a drinking party he was evangelizing those around him instead
58610 do you want me to sing to you ill sing all night if it will keep the bad dreams away
58611 what this unit what it do me confused op japan
58612 there is no doubt in my mind that major league soccer in portland would both add a tremendous amount to the league and have a phenomenally positive impact on our community and state
58613 we have the most ardent and authentic soccer fan base in the united states and soccer city usa deserves a major league soccer team
58614 if you grasp and cling to life on your terms youll loose it but if you let go youll get life on gods terms
58615 no one will dare to call you plain when im through with you
58616 i dont think mccain would ever do something like that
58617 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face
58618 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
58619 raising taxes during a slowdown is the worst thing for the economy that kind of pledge from obama rings hollow
58620 this is not something our treaty anticipated this is a danger to every human in the area
58621 the cells in the body react to emfs in cell phones just like they do to other environmental toxins including heavy metals and chemicals
58622 cell phones give off radiation any time theyre turned on so that they can communicate with base stations
58623 the radiation emitted however is stronger and more frequent when youre talking or messaging
58624 yes since childrens nervous systems are still developing and they have thinner scalps and skulls than adults they should use cell phones only in emergencies

58640 i think its ridiculous that karl rove thinks that he doesnt have to follow the law
58641 and nobody in this country should be above the law
58642 from our perspective its a traditional historical name given by the folks who lived there

58650 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
58651 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
58652 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
58653 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour

58666 is a talented indvidual but he should be ashamed of these lyrics
58667 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
58668 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue

58675 money is kind of tight and you have to spend wisely
58676 weve been preparing for it actually for the last two or three weeks making sure that weve got everything in and in place
58677 im kinda window shopping but id be more inclined to maybe actually make a purchase tomorrow

58687 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
58688 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
58689 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
58690 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
58691 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
58692 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
58693 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
58694 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
58695 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

58704 the ruler should be discreet in keeping silence and profitable in speech lest he utter what should be kept secret or keep secret what should be uttered for just as incautious speech leads men into error so too unseasonable silence leaves in error those who might have been instructed often indeed incautious rulers being afraid of losing human favor fear to speak freely of what is right and in the words of the truth do not exercise the zeal of shepherds caring for the flock but serve the role of mercenaries for when the wolf appears they flee and hide themselves in silence wherefore the lord reproves them through the prophet saying they are all dumb dogs not able to bark
58705 choose life then that you and your descendants may live by loving the lord your god heeding his voice and holding fast to him
58706 you may vote for a person who is pro choice if you feel you have a moral reason to support the candidate for his stand on other issues
58707 its hard to find a candidate who supports all of the churchs teaching
58708 its a difficult time to decide how were voting especially this year
58709 for those who want to be told what to do this document does not tell them
58710 the reason this is important is no candidate this year and few candidates historically have perfectly lined up with catholic social teaching
58711 there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia
58712 catholics who vote for republican presidential candidate john mccain because of his anti abortion record also are voting for a candidate who supports the war in iraq a war pope benedict xvi clearly has opposed
58713 if you vote for someone who supports the war be actively involved in trying to change his mind

58733 i remember when de mello who was at the u n got killed in baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good mans life
58734 i was playing golf i think i was in central texas and they pulled me off the golf course and i said its just not worth it anymore to do

58757 in the past we have had scout groups and other organized groups utilize the park with special agreements however the complaints we are now receiving appear to be that individuals are camping on the island without permission and keeping others from enjoying the park

58759 we need to ensure that all our visitors to these islands are able to enjoy their uniqueness

58783 senator obama still has a comfortable 7 point lead but as in the primary he still is struggling among white blue collar workers
58784 its just raising a red flag to us that somethings not right with this
58785 is not a way to instill confidence in the integrity of the board and the process
58786 we see these threats from bluhm and contractors that they want to see this go through and yet we cant get information we should have

58790 rather it is a special interest electric transmission corridor the result of special interests seeking to reshape the electricity regulatory structure to enrich their bottom lines
58791 i am concerned that the scope of the implementation and the potential overuse of the new federal power line siting authority go beyond the narrow backstop authority that the committee intended when it crafted the provision
58792 the mind set is to keep your head down and get these power lines up and get this over with
58793 the federal government can be very arrogant when it comes to policies that affect real people

58804 i am a person who will be out there and i will continue to be out there across pennsylvania i speak out on numerous public issues that impact the general assembly and government in general and im going to continue to be a very open and accessible public servant
58805 but theres nothing to prevent the attorney general from giving voice to issues important to taxpayers
58806 something i have believed in for a long time is that wherever tax dollars flow there ought to be sunlight how this state has allowed millions of dollars to be spent in the dark is beyond me
58807 i would be more than happy to audit the general assembly or any other area of government

58816 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
58817 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
58818 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
58819 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
58820 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
58821 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
58822 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met

58829 tax rebates have been a very effective way of propping up the economy in the second quarter and less so in the third quarter
58830 to fix the economic growth problems you have to restore liquidity to the system
58831 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
58832 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
58833 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
58834 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
58835 none of us have ever seen an economic development cd
58836 the videos theyre a waste of money people biking through the local park it doesnt influence any of us
58837 quality of life is never on the matrix because every city has it
58838 im not going to take a company to a drug infested area by the time were short listing 20 to 25 sites quality of life is not a factor its a given
58839 what communities need to focus on is quality of place
58840 the reality is were not all cut out to do that theres not a demand in the marketplace for that many history grads
58841 im looking for a lot of big things from myself im expecting a lot out of our team this year im expecting to be more involved in the offense this year
58842 im looking forward to it but hines is still our go to guy
58843 we need those first downs we need those small catches across the middle we need a big game play from hines hes still going to be there for us
58844 im used more so as a deep threat everyone would say but at the same time i think my opportunity will come to become the leader of the team
58845 one thing i like hes a great student of the game hes always asking when i tell him something its not oh i know he says i see what youre talking about
58846 he definitely has leadership skills you dont have to be a vocal guy just lead by example because theres always somebody watching you
58847 we have heath at tight end santonio myself nate sweed we have a one two running back punch
58848 ben has weapons around him so the excuses shouldnt be made
58849 i had actually started crying and i said to the other people that i was golfing with you must think im just crazy assuming this but i just have this really bad feeling i felt he had gone down in the bridge i just i felt it
58850 and i kind of explained to them that there was a bad accident and that the bridge fell down and daddy was on the bridge and died so now he is with grandpa in heaven
58851 you can never put enough money on somebodys life i mean i wouldnt care how much money you gave me it wouldnt give me what i had with my husband
58852 its been almost a year but there is not a day that goes by that i dont talk to him or i think about him and its not just once a day its many times a day it just doesnt change in a years time i think some people think ok the first year is over you can move on and it doesnt work that way
58853 its always unfortunate to lose trees but certainly theres a lot more devastation with the airport accident trees can be replaced
58854 it is a good community we all work together we all help one another so well pull though
58855 but she thinks i could rope the moon in her eyes there is nothing i cant do when i think its out of reach shes the reason i still try she thinks i could rope the moon
58856 giving this award at this time sends the wrong message to the community at a time when minneapolis and the police department are working hard to strengthen connections with the community and i dont want this to happen again i have directed chief dolan to review the mpd process for giving awards and report back to me within one month on ways to prevent situations like this in the future
58857 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
58858 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
58859 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
58860 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
58861 collaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others
58862 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
58863 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
58864 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
58865 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
58866 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
58867 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
58868 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
58869 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
58870 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
58871 i had no idea you were going to be here at this meeting
58872 captain alphas said this meeting was so urgent i should have come
58873 as you all know this meeting is very urgent our attention has been called to something very interesting that we could use for the good of the world
58874 we have just recently found out that there are ancient relics hidden somewhere in hyrule they were created by a twili girl known by the name of demora
58875 you should be sorry you better watch where youre going
58876 you know what im not sorry and youre a jerk
58877 do you want to know something i have been very nice to you for a very long time ever since i met you i have been sick of trying to cope with you
58878 you are just a pathetic low life who doesnt even deserve to live here you were born pathetic youll die pathetic and only the peasants and low lives just like you will mourn over you
58879 so you managed to defeat my bandits now didnt you
58880 you killed my family and friends you burned down my home and i bet you killed many others too but the attack on this village is the last time youll harm any innocent lives
58881 throw her in the river not far from here and let her drown
58882 please caroline come back to me why did you run away why
58883 dont go caroline hyrule is counting on us its counting on you please dont let it down please dont let my father down
58884 what about us we were supposed to be together i love you i dont want you to go please caroline dont leave me
58885 it was only a nightmare its alright its all over
58886 why dont women run the world maybe its because they dont want to
58887 think of all the problems that disappear overnight we dont have to think about family leave or after school or the day to day grind or the tough challenges of work and family
58888 when we saw women starting to drop out in the early part of this decade we thought it was the motherhood movement women staying home to raise their kids
58889 we did not think it was the economy but when we looked into it we realized that it was
58890 this shows what can be done if the banking industry looks beyond just saying lets foreclose
58891 what were doing allows you to use solar panels 24 7 because you can use the fuel that they generate any time you want
58892 thats a typical scenario in these wage and hour cases which are kind of prevalent now across the country
58893 in order to avoid paying overtime pseudo titles and titles that dont normally reflect the responsibilities of that individual are given
58894 i think we have a lot to be proud of
58895 exxons profits are excessive shells profits leave us shellshocked and bp now stands for bloated profits
58896 its the most selfish group of companies that ive ever seen and the most hypocritical
58897 its not down but its marginally up in the low single digits our debit card spending on the other hand has continued to grow and is very robust
58898 weve been looking for a starter home here for years
58899 builders are paying about 500 000 for a smaller home on a 10 000 to 12 000 square foot lot and tearing it down
58900 the buyers for new houses are from surrounding communities such as newton or are trading up from within the town or relocating here from out of state
58901 for the same money in newton youd get a house that needs a lot of work
58902 multi use buildings in suburban downtowns are the coming thing
58903 buyers are looking to be near the train and be able to walk out the door to shops and restaurants
58904 the same thing in boston or brookline would have cost over 1 million
58905 needham center has all the features of a nice downtown restaurants shops a hardware store but its considerable less expensive
58906 people used to say needham was a meat and potatoes town
58907 we like to believe that we helped change that by bringing ethnic food here
58908 the town has great demographics for a restaurant like mine
58909 co opting its supposedly independent research department to help sell auction rate securities
58910 the inarguable fact is the number of auctions that had failed in nearly two decades of ars sales was small in 2007 there were no failed auctions of securities sold to retail clients and in fact none to these clients until late january 2008
58911 if a leader isnt passionate about the strategy he she wants others to follow then the results will be marginal and difficult to measure
58912 good communication skills and passion create something intangible that drives an organization forward
58913 actually she might be treated better than my kids because unlike my teenagers she always wants to be with me and doesnt consider me embarrassing
58914 i like tinkering i like looking at things and trying to make them better being involved in running a smaller company was very appealing to me
58915 when you look at a profit and loss statement what you see is an average but its an average comprised of a lot of different components
58916 if you can deaverage it you can understand each part of the business and what makes sense and what doesnt ive done this at staples at cvs and for clients at bcg
58917 it was hard for people to give up all those products they wanted to develop and instead focus on just a few
58918 we still have all 150 in the pipeline but now theyre in a parking lot
58919 travel in packs run red lights and make unsafe u turns
58920 my biggest concern about this issue is my right to say no
58921 a rock star out of bed at 8 a m
58922 you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother
58923 although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother
58924 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being in our hearts
58925 id be afraid if they caught up with him he might say if i cant have her nobody can
58926 but she never was a child he never gave her the chance he was trying to make a child prodigy of her
58927 he never let her play with other kids he said she might catch something
58928 he said oh no she cant have any of that
58929 the whole thing is constructed to keep him in control
58930 was always trying to give the best to snooks the attention she deserved
58931 it will be interesting to watch but my gut feeling is that mannys going to love it here
58932 he died he died in our arms i dont know how they brought him back
58933 you know what the way my body feels today i cant say im surprised
58934 every time you played him you knew he was going to be a force and you knew you were going to get hit
58935 as soon as the game was over and you went in the training room to get iced down it wasnt because of anyone else but andre tippett
58936 as you look back at it he and lawrence taylor changed the course of pass protection
58937 you could no longer make a running back responsible for the blitzing linebacker in those 3 4 fronts you had to account for him with a tackle and a lot of times that wasnt enough you had to have a tight end over there too
58938 on offense we always wanted to create mismatches defenses tried to do the same thing and getting a guy like andre on a 210 pound running back that was a mismatch
58939 seven concussions later i cant recall the details but ill tell you what the bottom line is he was one of the most dominant defensive players i ever went against
58940 you hope hes going to get blocked but you know going in that hes going to get you once or twice a game the majority of times i never knew who hit me until i watched it on the film but i never really had to look when i was playing the team stats it was always no 56
58941 he came in and got me at the old meadowlands and when you got hit there there was the whiplash effect they said the back of my head hit the turf and bounced i thought i was fine but i went into the huddle on the next series and couldnt even spit out the play so they pulled me out and i didnt play the last half
58942 okurowski was doing ironman when i didnt know what the sport was and i had no clue what a triathlon was
58943 he said if you already can swim and you can already run you can learn to bike and i slowly learned over time what the sport was about
58944 i kind of realized after my junior year of college that my running was good but it wasnt winning ncaa championships it was going to be kind of hard for me to take that next step in running so i started playing around with triathlons my senior year
58945 i had a great swim in the qualifiers and i came out of the water 25th
58946 that was good for me but i think i can do better
58947 ive worked really hard on my swim and in the past that had been my limiter if i dont do well in the swim you cant be sure a good run will help you catch
58948 i honestly think thats one of the cool things because i know i can do it on that course
58949 i think that gives me a little extra confidence going into it because i think that course is good for me
58950 courses can be very different this course is very much a strength course compared to other courses that are totally flat this course has a nice big hill and a long downhill and the run is really tough i know all of it
58951 i dont read the newspapers dont listen to the shows dont go to the internet sites
58952 we wont know until we get to the games and we see how things shake out there
58953 theres always the potential to be one of the best and thats always the goal
58954 but at the same time its not very realistic to say that until we actually go out there and go against some people we dont go against every day
58955 but i havent read much into what people have said up to this point its always our goal to try to be the best out there and that can be said for every team in the league
58956 we got friends on other teams and i know a lot of jibber jabber goes on
58957 but my deal is to stay humble and modest about it and keep my mouth shut and let everything take care of itself ive been fasting away from tv i havent watched tv movies havent read newspapers nothing
58958 ill say this about senator obama he sure raises peoples hackles
58959 ive never seen anyone so roundly criticized for such grievous offenses as giving excellent speeches and urging people of different backgrounds to take a chance on working together how dare he and 200 000 people turned out to hear him in berlin unforgivable
58960 the country we love is in trouble in truth we are in grave danger of declining as a nation if we do not act quickly that decline will become dramatic
58961 when something bad happens people are there to help you
58962 but ive never done it as much as now doing a mural is big and its going to be up for a year
58963 we all decided we wanted hands holding up the bridge the bus on it and the mural going from dark to light
58964 this did occur but its not how you define your whole life
58965 small market drugs big price tags are drug companies exploiting people with rare diseases
58966 i understand that we have a market based economy klobuchar told the committee
58967 its fine for companies to make money on the products they sell
58968 i dont think this is the law of supply and demand
58969 an elderly woman from park rapids minn who suffers from cutaneous t cell lymphoma was forced to pay over 8 000 in out of pocket expenses for mustargen a drug sold by ovation pharmaceuticals whose single dose price increased from around 50 to nearly 550 after the company acquired the rights to the drug
58970 we invited ovation to take part in this hearing and they declined to come
58971 my testimony is not a rant against the industry as a whole for this industry has produced extraordinary advances in health care from which we all benefit
58972 rather my concern is focused on the practices of some specialty pharmaceutical companies and the questionable pricing of some older drugs
58973 it has been on the market for more than three decades so this dramatic price increase cannot be attributed to the high cost of research and development as purchasers the childrens hospitals have had no other options there have been no other manufacturers of indocin
58974 effectively one company has a monopoly and can use it to price gouge
58975 ini gerakan moral kita betul betul dikejutkan soal rencana pembelian mobil baru untuk anggota kpu itu
58976 kita akan bawa tujuh mobil itu untuk memudahkan kita akan beri nama anggota kpu setiap mobilnya mudah mudahan kita bisa bertemu mereka
58977 ini yang kita catat betul kabar ini mengejutkan hal ini tidak boleh dibiarkan karena pengadaan itu tidak pantas dan tidak sesuai bila diukur dengan kinerja kpu selama ini kan selama ini kinerja mereka buruk dan kacau balau
58978 sekarang ini kan ada mobil lama dan eks anggota kpu lama kalau alasan mogok pertanyaannya ke mana anggaran perbaikan dan perawatan itu kalau rusak apa sudah dilakukan audit bahwa itu tidak bisa digunakan

59059 in derbyshire county council v times newspapers ltd 1993 1 all er 1011 house of lords the plaintiff a local authority brought an action against the publishers of a newspaper its editor and two journalists claiming damages for defamatory articles about the local authoritys investments and control of its superannuation fund it was held that a local authority and so public authorites and governmental bodies had no right to sue for defamation in respect of its governing or administrative reputation if no actual financial loss was pleaded or alleged lord keith stated that it is of the highest public importance that a democratically elected governmental body indeed any governmental body should be open to uninhibited public criticism the threat of a civil action for defamation would inevitably have an inhibiting effect on freedom of speech
59060 the facts in the case are fortunately refreshingly simple in two issues of the sunday times newspaper on 17 and 24 september 1989 there appeared articles concerning share deals involving the superannuation fund of the derbyshire county council the articles in the issue of 17 september were headed revealed socialist tycoons deals with a labour chief and bizarre deals of a council leader and the media tycoon that in the issue of 24 september was headed council share deals under scrutiny the council leader was mr david melvyn bookbinder the media tycoon was mr owen oyston it is unnecessary for the purposes of this judgement to set out in any detail the contents of these articles it is sufficient to say that they question the propriety of certain investments made by the council of moneys in its superannuation fund with mr bookbinder as the prime mover in three deals with mr oyston or companies controlled by him excerpts from the articles giving the flavour of the allegations made will be found in the judgement at first instance to which those interested may refer the council is the administering authority of its superannuation fund under the superannuation act 1972 and the local government superannuation regulations 1986 si 1986 no 24 made thereunder
59061 of and concerning the council and of and concerning the council in the way of its discharge of its responsibility for the investment and control of the superannuation fund
59062 by reason of the words published on 17 september 1989 and the words and graph published on 24 september 1989 the plaintiff council has been injured in its credit and reputation and has been brought into public scandal odium and contempt and has suffered loss and damage
59063 in the case of two if not three departments of our manchester city council bribery and corruption have existed and done their nefarious work
59064 this is an action brought by a municipal corporation to recover damages for what is alleged to be a libel on the corporation itself as distinguished from its individual members or officials the libel complained of consists of a charge of bribery and corruption the question is whether such an action will lie i think it will not it is altogether unprecedented and there is no principle on which it could be founded the limits of a corporations right of action for libel are those suggested by pollock cb in the case which has been referred to a corporation may sue for a libel affecting property not for one merely affecting personal reputation the present case falls within the latter class there must therefore be judgement for the defendant
59065 this action is brought by the mayor aldermen and citizens of the city of manchester to recover damages from the defendant in respect of that which is alleged by them to be a libel on the corporation the alleged libel is contained in a letter written by the defendant to the editor of the manchester examiner and times which charged as alleged by the statement of claim that bribery and corruption existed or had existed in three departments of the manchester city council and that the plaintiffs were either parties thereto or culpably ignorant thereof and that the said bribery and corruption prevailed to such an extent as to render necessary an inquiry by a parliamentary commission now it is for us to determine whether a corporation can bring such an action and i must say that to my mind to allow such a thing would be wholly unprecedented and contrary to principle a corporation may sue for a libel affecting property not for one merely affecting personal reputation this does not fall within the class of cases in respect of which a corporation can maintain an action but does fall within the second class commented on by pollock cb in his judgement in the case of the metropolitan saloon omnibus co ltd v hawkins 4 h amp n 87 with which i fully agree a quotation follows the charge in the present case is one of bribery and corruption of which a corporation cannot possibly be guilty and therefore in my opinion this action will not lie
59066 that a corporation at common law can sue in respect of a libel there is no doubt it would be monstrous if a corporation could maintain no action for slander of title through which they lost a great deal of money it could not sue in respect of an imputation of murder or incest or adultery because it could not commit those crimes nor could it sue in respect of a charge of corruption for a corporation cannot be guilty of corruption although the individuals composing it may but it would be very odd if a corporation had no means of protecting itself against wrong and if its property is injured by slander it has no means of redress except by action therefore it appears to me clear that a corporation at common law may maintain an action for a libel by which its property is injured
59067 i have considered the case and i have come to the conclusion that the law of libel is one and the same as to all plaintiffs and that in every action of libel whether the statement complained of is or is not a libel depends on the same question viz whether the jury are of opinion that what has been published with regard to the plaintiff would tend in the minds of people of ordinary sense to bring the plaintiff into contempt hatred or ridicule or to injure his character the question is really the same by whomsoever the action is brought whether by a person a firm or a company but though the law is the same the application of it is no doubt different with regard to different kinds of plaintiffs there are statements which with regard to some plaintiffs would undoubtedly constitute a libel but which if published of another kind of plaintiffs would not have the same effect
59068 with regard to a firm or a company it is impossible to lay down an exhaustive rule as to what would be a libel on them but the same rule is applicable to a statement made with regard to them statements may be made with regard to their mode of carrying on business such as to lead people of ordinary sense to the opinion that they conduct their business badly and inefficiently if so the law will be the same in their case as in that of an individual and the statement will be libellous then if the case be one of libel whether on a person a firm or a company the law is that the damages are at large it is not necessary to prove any particular damage the jury may give such damages as they think fit having regard to the conduct of the parties respectively and all the circumstances of the case
59069 just as a trading company has a trading reputation which it is entitled to protect by bringing an action for defamation so in my view the plaintiffs as a local government corporation have a governing reputation which they are equally entitled to protect in the same way of course bearing in mind the vital distinction between defamation of the corporation as such and defamation of its individual officers or members i entirely accept the statement made in gatley on libel and slander 6th edn 1967 p409 para 890 a corporation or company cannot maintain an action of libel or slander for any words which reflect not upon itself but solely upon its individual officers or members then there is a quotation to merely attack or challenge the rectitude of the officers or members of a corporation and hold them or either of them up to scorn hatred contempt or obloquy for acts done in their official capacity or which would render them liable to criminal prosecution does not give the corporation a right of action for libel i stress the words solely and merely in those passages the quotation given in gatley there is from a united states case warner v ingersoll 1907 157 fed r 311
59070 day j seems to put his judgement on two grounds first that a corporation may sue for a libel affecting property and not for one merely affecting personal reputation if this was ever right it has in my view been overruled by south hetton coal co v north eastern news association ltd 1894 1 qb 133 134 135 where substantially this argument was used by the defendants and by national union of general and municipal workers v gillian where the manchester corporation case 1891 1 qb 94 was cited the other ground seems to have been that a corporation cannot be guilty of corruption and therefore it cannot be defamatory to say or write that it has been guilty of corruption this was based on the obiter dictum of pollock cb in metropolitan saloon omnibus co v hawkins 1859 4 h amp n 87 and was repeated later by lopes lj in south hetton coal co v north eastern news association ltd 1894 1 qb 133 141 the manchester corporation case is severely criticised in spencer bower on actionable defamation 1908 pp 279 and 280 in fraser on libel and slander 7th edn 1936 pp 89 and 90 and by oliver j in willis v brooks 1947 1 all er 191 where he said at p192 that after reading the national union of general and municipal workers case he agreed with the editors of fraser who say at p 90 it is respectfully submitted that the above statement of the law by day j is unsound in principle and would not be upheld in the court of appeal oliver j in willis v brooks 1947 1 all er 191 193 said counsel for the defendants who incidentally were sir valentine holmes and mr milmo did not seriously contend that an action for libel imputing something very like corruption as in this case would not lie in any circumstances at the suit of a trade union and he awarded the plaintiffs gbp 500 damages as i have said the manchester corporation case was cited in the national union of general and municipal workers case and the libel in that case seems to have imputed among other things something very like corruption
59071 the actual decision in the manchester corporation case can perhaps be supported as mr waterhouse suggested on the argument that the libel there was not capable of referring to a corporation consisting as the plaintiffs did of the mayor aldermen and citizens and not as here of the chairman and councillors i think that that case is distinguishable from this on that ground and also on the ground that in my view none of the statements in the leaflet in this case actually impute corruption but i hope that the court of appeal will soon have occasion to consider the manchester corporation case
59072 the fundamental right of freedom of speech is involved in this litigation and not merely the right of liberty of the press if this action can be maintained against a newspaper it can be maintained against every private citizen who ventures to criticise the ministers who are temporarily conducting the affairs of his government where any person by speech or writing seeks to persuade others to violate existing law or to overthrow by force or other unlawful means the existing government he may be punished but all other utterances or publications against the government must be considered absolutely privileged while in the early history of the struggle for freedom of speech the restrictions were enforced by criminal prosecutions it is clear that a civil action is as great if not a greater restriction than a criminal prosecution if the right to criticise the government is a privilege which with the exceptions above enumerated cannot be restricted then all civil as well as criminal actions are forbidden a despotic or corrupt government can more easily stifle opposition by a series of civil actions than by criminal prosecutions
59073 it follows therefore that every citizen has a right to criticise an inefficient or corrupt government without fear of civil as well as criminal prosecution this absolute privilege is founded on the principle that it is advantageous for the public interest that the citizen should not be in any way fettered in his statements and where the public service or due administration of justice is involved he shall have the right to speak his mind freely
59074 in a free democratic society it is almost too obvious to need stating that those who hold office in government and who are responsible for public administration must always be open to criticism any attempt to stifle or fetter such criticism amounts to political censorship of the most insidious and objectionable kind at the same time it is no less obvious that the very purpose of criticism levelled at those who have the conduct of public affairs by their political opponents is to undermine public confidence in their stewardship and to persuade the electorate that the opponents would make a better job of it than those presently holding office in the light of these considerations their lordships cannot help viewing a statutory provision which criminalises statements likely to undermine public confidence in the conduct of public affairs with the utmost suspicion
59075 i am prepared to assume for the purposes of the present argument that the crown may at least in so far as it takes part in trading in competition with its subjects enjoy a reputation damage to which could be calculated in money on that assumption there is certainly force in the contention that it would be unfair to deny to the crown the weapon an action for damages for defamation which is most feared by calumniators nevertheless it seems to me that considerations of fairness and convenience are on balance distinctly against the recognition of a right in the crown to sue the subject in a defamation action to protect that reputation the normal means by which the crown protects itself against attacks upon its management of the countrys affairs is political action and not litigation and it would i think be unfortunate if that practice were altered at present certain kinds of criticism of those who manage the states affairs may lead to criminal prosecutions while if the criticism consists of defamatory utterances against individual servants of the state actions for defamation will lie at their suit but subject to the risk of these sanctions and to the possible further risk to which reference will presently be made of being sued by the crown for injurious falsehood any subject is free to express his opinion upon the management of the countrys affairs without fear of legal consequences i have no doubt that it would involve a serious interference with the free expression of opinion hitherto enjoyed in this country if the wealth of the state derived from the states subjects could be used to launch against those subjects actions for defamation because they have falsely and unfairly it may be criticised or condemned the management of the country such actions could not i think be confined to those brought by the railways administration for criticism of the running of the railways quite a number of government departments as appeared in the course of the argument indulge in some form of trading on a greater or a lesser scale moreover the government when it raises loans is interested in the good or bad reputation that it may enjoy among possible subscribers to such loans it would be difficult to assign any limits to the crowns right to sue for defamation once its right in any case were recognised
59076 1 everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers 2 the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary

59273 last year the unions claimed that productivity gains in the industry were a direct result of good weather
59274 these reports shows productivity gains have been sustained and are not due to climate change effects
59275 this report categorically puts to bed union calls for the abolition of the abcc and further confirms what contractors have been reporting that the construction industry has seen a significant and permanent lift in productivity and industrial harmony since the abcc was established in 2005
59276 the gains made in recent years will be lost if the abcc is abolished immediately and if the powers of its replacement body are watered down in february 2010
59277 this would risk turning back the clock on the significant gains made over the past four years and potentially seriously undermine the economic gains which have delivered so much to the economy chief executive heather ridout said in a statement

59373 thats just not something theyd do they started talking to the favres about this shortly after he retired
59374 he felt it was important to let brett know face to face that he was serious about a long term relationship regardless of his intentions to play football

59381 its a reflection of this administrations inability to deal in a rational way with complex issues such as immigration
59382 this gives illegal immigrants the chance to leave the country without any harm being done and under very controlled circumstances

59393 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
59394 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
59395 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation
59396 the nations news organizations continue to generate dismal diversity numbers year after year ten by 2010 is a significant step in the right direction
59397 katya now you have to tell me how did you start painting
59398 i started painting in my young years i was growing up in moscow in a city full of history and art and i guess i took everything for granted around me hardly noticing grand columns powerful bronze horsemen and festive fountains
59399 you had access to a lot of art when you were young
59400 yes everything was steeping in history and art as i remember nobody would stop and say what an amazing building it is nobody was admiring buildings unless they were tourists
59401 do you remember what painting in particular had an effect on you some early paintings you remember
59402 18th 19th century there would be portraits of some aristocrats or landscapes scenes with peasants etc
59403 many artists and among them were repin savrasov levitan etc they had an impact on me
59404 his drawing style full of detail expressing character he really would get into a personality
59405 and what about the content of his paintings what did you like about his subject matter
59406 he would put people and nature in some sort of a correlation
59407 so there was a kind of silence that constantly accompanies your visit to the gallery i like that
59408 no not sure i think it gives you an opportunity of exploring yourself without being told what to do and unless you have a guided tour you can do whatever you like you can go to contemporary classic or ancient art and spend time there
59409 levitan and the painting is called march this is one of my favourites
59410 we have a number of extraordinary painters and the russian school of art is one of the best i always felt sorry i could not pursue art as a profession
59411 i admire abstract art but i think i have to understand what the artist wants to say just a splash of colour would not interest me very much
59412 oh yes there was not a big variety of paints you definitely could get watercolours temperas i found out that the st petersburg watercolours are some of the best watercolours in the world as they are produced with real pigments good brushes made from squirrel and you could buy them really cheaply
59413 i did a bit of copying i would say i looked at faces and tried to get the same expression or did drawings from imagination i wanted to copy the gesture
59414 yes my mum and dad encouraged me to do it they looked at it as a way of passing my time once when i was 10 i did a drawing completely from my imagination of some french women dancers i had this idea of some beautiful women in fine clothes dancing how on earth i came to this idea i do not know and i did not see toulose lautrecs paintings a family friend konstantin glagolev saw my drawings and said he would like to take them to show to an artist friend in a couple of weeks he brought the paintings back and said that he showed my drawing to the artist and the artists opinion was that i expressed a lot of movement in my drawings i think it was an encouragement for me to continue
59415 no i had another friend a book illustrator i still have her as a friend a lovely woman tanya gnisyuk she always would encourage me to paint she would say just do some painting she will give me a small wooden board in a hardware store and say you can paint what you like it can be a fantasy or you could look at something like flowers she showed me reproductions of some russian folk art that is how i got the idea i still have my first cheese board that i painted at tanyas home which represents a vase with stalks of wheat and chinese lantern flowers in it
59416 did you have any friends of your own age who would paint
59417 unfortunately not i went to study physics and languages and there was nobody around me interested in art i got support from my mum i have to explain that there were no free venues for artists in the soviet era to display ones work there were exhibitions only for artists who were part of the artists union supervised by the state there was no freedom of expressing yourself poor artists could not sell their work could not show it to anybody when perestroika happened i must admit there was a rapid change in freeing of the arts the first sign of this was a vernissage an exhibiton of art and craft in the park in moscow i guess it is like montmartre so in moscow it is the arbat street it was so extraordinary that little freedom that artists gained
59418 yes i did i had a teacher olgaivanovna from year 5 she loved my work and she gave a lot of tasks as she knew i could do really well
59419 it is a very interesting question i felt that pressure there was one task in particular when i was summoned to the blackboard with another student to do a poster for the labour day there was a competition and it was unpleasant i lost it as i did not draw the hammer and the sickle in the right way
59420 you did not remember which way the hammer and sickle are turned
59421 you were not paying much attention in your life to it
59422 no because i did not like this symbolism false symbolism the teacher said to me i will still put excellent for the term but you failed this competition finally that was my farewell with propaganda i realised i would never participate in any propaganda art
59423 yes in a way the other girl chose a simple thing she did dots stars and balloons we were 10 at the time i tried to make it symbolic and it was too hard for me
59424 no i did not say anything i was just unhappy
59425 that nasty experience what effect did it have on what you wanted to paint in the futu re
59426 i realised that i did not want to participate in any propaganda anything artificial reinforced by state we were surrounded by socialist realism everythere i just loved nature observing animals i wanted to do something soft and unthreatening i still loved portraiture but not painted in socialist realism where things are pushed onto you that put me off straight away
59427 yes a sense of nature poetic description of villages run down churches and things like that that was my interest
59428 did you see any modern art abstractions and big works like jackson pollocks paintings
59429 allegations of such abuse should be thoroughly investigated by school districts and if the allegations are substantiated the media may request records containing the identity of the perpetrating teacher
59430 but the most unfortunate consequence and one that is completely unacceptable is that if predatory teachers are undetected children will continue to suffer at their hands
59431 mere fact of the allegation of sexual misconduct toward a minor may hold the teacher up to hatred and ridicule in the community without any evidence that such misconduct ever occurred
59432 under our holding the public can access documents related to the allegations and investigations subject to redactions thus maintaining the citizens ability to inform themselves about school district operations
59433 concerning the teachers private lives and are not specific incidents of misconduct during the course of employment
59434 the material in a teachers file relating to allegations of sexual misconduct involving students is not information that is protected by the right of privacy
59435 it does not pertain to the intimate details of ones personal and private life but is instead information about alleged specific instances of misconduct occurring in the course of the teachers performance of his or her public duties a kind of information that this court has specifically identified as not encompassed by the right of privacy
59436 where a letter simply seeks to guide future conduct does not mention substantiated misconduct and a teacher is not disciplined or subject to any restriction the name and identifying information of the teacher should be redacted
59437 this result protects both the public interest in overseeing school districts responses to allegations letters of direction give citizens a complete picture of a school districts investigations and accompanying procedures and the teachers individual privacy rights

59462 i really enjoy the experience competing with the top shooters
59463 i want to go to college shooting and im hoping to get a scholarship
59464 the national matches are the world series of competitive shooting as far as the conventional shooting community is concerned
59465 the national matches are important because they display the importance of the competitive shooting discipline in the way that builds citizenship especially in young shooters
59466 it teaches self reliance and self discipline in an adult activity and provides a foundation for the rest of their lives because it provides an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of adulthood
59467 shooters like the fellowship and you see people who take a week of vacation just to come here and shoot its a like a camping trip
59468 one of the greatest no preparation miracles ever you do it anytime anywhere with any can and any coin and its guaranteed to kill
59469 this is a great trick you are crazy for releasing it
59470 the impromptu nature and startling power of this effect is a rarity in the magic world buy the dvd you will not be disappointed

59474 its great news patrick is so well and there are a lot of offers for him
59475 everyone wants him to star in a dirty dancing sequel its just a matter of him making his mind up
59476 we wanted an apology from rajinikanth and an apology meant that rajini should seek apology from all the five crore kannadigas for that he has to call a media conference and announce that he regrets for what he had spoken in chennai on the day when the tamil film artists had organised a protest rally the kfcc is always acting against the interests of kannadigas we do not believe a letter to the president of the kfcc will dilute the feeling of hurt among kannadigas we are sure to block the release of the film in any part of the state
59477 we are told he is coming here secretly for some of his personal work if he publicly visits bangalore our volunteers are sure to question him about his remark on the hogenakal issue
59478 the threat of protest was there even during the release of rajinikanths previous film shivaji and even kamal hassans previous film dasavatharam but both the films were released without any problems we are sure that
59479 but every channel is different as are the commercials why oh why do those d mn commercials have to be so loud

59487 el incremento del precio del petr leo unido a la dependencia de pa ses importadores del crudo para la generaci n con combustibles f siles viene incentivando cambios en la matriz energ tica de los pa ses
59488 factores como el crecimiento de la demanda de energ a el ctrica el cambio clim tico el agotamiento de los recursos naturales y las exigencias de protecci n ambiental son las fuerzas impulsoras que vienen orientando la planificaci n de nuevas centrales el ctricas
59489 para hacer cualquier cambio de tecnolog as de generaci n se necesitan por lo menos dos o tres a os de implementaci n
59490 entonces mientras los precios de los combustibles sigan donde est n esta estrechez va a continuar por lo menos por dos o tres a os m s
59491 las energ as renovables requieren una inversi n inicial cuantiosa
59492 pero una vez hecha sta la energ a e lica puede ser tan barata como la hidroel ctrica por ejemplo y ya la generaci n con combustibles f siles est casi en el mismo precio
59493 estas centrales requieren una planificaci n previa de muchos a os desde la identificaci n de los recursos hasta una posible convocatoria para su ejecuci n

59507 kadar pulangan mestilah lebih tinggi daripada kadar faedah pinjaman dan indeks harga pengguna cpi supaya syarikat bas mendapat untung dalam kes malaysia kadar pulangan itu boleh ditetapkan sekitar 12 hingga 15 peratus
59508 melalui kedua dua indeks itu kita akan dapat mengkaji dan menentukan kenaikan harga tambang sewajarnya yang mengambil kira kepentingan pengusaha bas dan penumpang
59509 permintaan menaikkan kuota bersifat menyeluruh dan tidak terperinci serta boleh menyebabkan ketirisan pihak syarikat bas yang benar benar terhimpit akan lega tetapi syarikat bas lain akan mengaut keuntungan berganda
59510 kalau kerajaan meluluskan kenaikan tambang itu adakah pengusaha bas boleh memberi jaminan kualiti perkhidmatan bertambah baik terutama dari aspek keselamatan
59511 ini kerana keadaan kos bahan api akan kembali seperti sebelum kerajaan menaikkan harga diesel daripada rm1 58 kepada rm2 58 seliter awal bulan lalu

59516 no nos suben el sueldo todo se va a pagar impuestos
59517 el problema es que pemex est al l mite de su capacidad para producir y abastecer combustible
59518 finalmente lo que vamos a tener es una reforma no muy sustantiva
59519 hasta ahora el efecto de los ingresos petroleros es hacia arriba porque la producci n no ha bajado tanto como para contrarrestar el incremento en el precio del petr leo
59520 tarde o temprano se terminar el actual ciclo de precios altos del crudo y debemos prepararnos para enfrentar un entorno futuro menos favorable
59521 con este n mero una empresa privada ya hubiera quebrado
59522 si hablamos de otros indicadores como tecnolog a propia y experiencia internacional pemex queda en un lugar rezagado
59523 la compa a tiene 300 localizaciones que no ha perforado en aguas someras y profundas por falta de dinero
59524 no tiene ning n sentido darle dinero a pemex si no lo puede ejercer
59525 a pemex le dicen te voy a dar 100 pero s lo puedes ejercer 80 los 20 restantes los dejas en los bancos

59542 well what should we do about it i mean should we tell the police
59543 its not likely that the government will impose the capitalgains tax while the stock market is still struggling
59544 i am perfectly happy living in my own little world everyone here likes me

59557 im all about my dollars what the f ck is 50 cent
59558 i put prodigy in his place on that summer jam screen
59559 you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart i will be found by you
59560 the sign of a superior mind is the ability to hold two opposing thoughts at the same time
59561 if you had been courting me then this would have been your death as it is you are still my friend but youre an inconsiderate asshole
59562 but my father didnt live in minneapolis he wasnt a season ticket holder and nobody in los angeles ever lied to him
59563 i wrote those articles before the oklahoma city guys started lying to me
59564 this is an extremely sensitive area requiring some difficult moral and ethical issues to be resolved
59565 in any new surrogacy law it is important that the first and foremost consideration should be the interests of the child
59566 the world at his fingertips a classmate who did not wish to be named told theage com au
59567 he was school captain so everything that comes along with that he was in everyones good books just a vibrant person liked by everyone he knew everyone knew everything
59568 he was good at sport good at school he was an amazing graphic designer he had it all set up
59569 honestly the fact that people are saying he had a fight is ridiculous hes so not that sort of person at all hes not confrontational
59570 i believe so much in god and i believe every one of us have god within us and im sure some good soul would have seen something that has happened to my son and i want them to come and help me so that this will never happen to another child or anybody
59571 it shouldnt have happened and it shouldnt have happened to anybody
59572 as far as i know he has never been into any trouble he is an excellent student and he is my eldest son
59573 he was so keen in coming to melbourne because his cousins and all are here and he keeps chatting to me and saying im very fine here dont worry about me im loving melbourne and hes happy
59574 he becomes very emotional he starts tearing up when he sees me
59575 i havent got a bad word to say about the place
59576 weve got our first trial game in a couple of weeks and then four weeks after that our first home game
59577 everyone has talked up the toulon crowd and i cant wait to run out there and be a part of it
59578 they find you a place to live and give you a car straight away when you get here when the season starts they will put me into french school as well
59579 i think if i could have picked one dream club to come to when i obviously parted way with the force it would have been toulon
59580 i think its an attractive option for the top australian players that are earning big money in australia but they could earn a lot more over here without the salary cap put on them
59581 and its an attractive place i suppose for fringe australian players
59582 theres 14 teams in france and only four in australia so theres a lot more opportunity over here to get a start and play in a premier competition whereas the opportunities in australia may be a little more limited
59583 every player that is australian always has a dream of playing for the wallabies and i have not closed that door and hopefully the aru hasnt closed that door on me either
59584 but i am just concentrating on these two years over here and seeing what that presents first
59585 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
59586 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
59587 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
59588 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 per cent or 30 per cent or 18 per cent
59589 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
59590 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
59591 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
59592 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
59593 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
59594 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
59595 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
59596 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
59597 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
59598 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
59599 they ask us about the economy they want to talk about our plans for keeping the country safe and thats the campaign were running
59600 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity
59601 it was better than i expected the organisation was great and the music and atmosphere were fantastic
59602 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
59603 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
59604 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
59605 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
59606 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
59607 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
59608 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
59609 without the elected president and if there is a freak result within two or three years the army would have to come in and stop it
59610 hansens fastball has historically topped out in the high 90s and he consistently hit the mid 90s
59611 athletic outfielder with a very strong arm excellent approach at the plate good swing with a refined power and on base ability hits to all fields slightly above average speed for a right fielder solid in the field tough competitor fantastic teammate and individual who takes joy in playing the game moss possesses a good mental approach to the game able to evaluate his mistakes while still not harping on them moss began a transition to becoming a part time 1b in late 2007 and hes handled it rather smoothly
59612 the pattern is different so you have to look and think and find and grab while your doing the obsticle
59613 the pattern is different so you have to look and think and find and grab while your doing the obsticle
59614 at the end of the day that is certainly a very local government type issue
59615 again being held in judgment by the most incompetent state labor government in history dismissing a council that was extremely proactive in so many outcomes and projects for our area
59616 a living breathing city needs these sort of things to make them greater cities so as part of our vision for a world class city by 2025 a gallery is part of that
59617 we are absolutely committed to disciplined economic management but we must also recognise the underlying strengths of the australian economy and the fact that our surplus gives us a buffer against international uncertainty
59618 i think customers will be absolutely filthy if the banks do not pass on within a reasonable time any official cash rate reductions
59619 they have been seeking to slow our economy that has been their policy and we have asked them how many jobs is this going to cost what is it going to mean to people paying off their mortgages
59620 they have been hell bent on slowing our economy down and now they are getting exactly what they wanted
59621 well this aspect of christianity does not pass scrutiny but what about the other episodes is the doctrine as a whole credible
59622 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo
59623 im not positive of the reasons behind this past years infestation but we have invaded their territory
59624 also the heat and very little rain have probably caused them to be more active in order to find food

59629 nous devons donner lexemple et si nous avons demander dautres de prendre des mesures nous devons le faire aussi
59630 it was clear that this bill was necessary when our subcommittee learned at a hearing in june 2007 that an fps security guard contractor had failed to pay 600 d c area federal security officers and to make other important benefit payments to pensions health benefits and the like our subcommittee intervened when an action by the fps and the immigration and customs enforcement bureau a division of dhs where fps is placed was reported to us
59631 the effects on the security of employees visitors and the federal agencies alike could not be ignored in todays post 9 11 climate
59632 i think that this bipartisan bill is necessary to pass
59633 its certainly no secret that illegal employment is what drives illegal immigrants to come to the united states
59634 by using e verify employers are no longer expected to be document experts the liability of determining the legal status of an employee is placed on the government not the business owner
59635 making e verify mandatory will protect american workers and law abiding businesses from the unfair competition created by a massive illegal workforce
59636 an important alternative procurement strategy for research and development programs
59637 programs authorized to use ota other transaction authority are free to negotiate provisions that are mutually acceptable to all parties such as intellectual property and indemnity provisions
59638 this encourages non traditional contractors to develop cutting edge technologies that would otherwise be unavailable to the government
59639 the current financial reporting model costs too much and delivers little useful information to government decision makers
59640 many of our survey respondents question the value of much of the work that they must do especially in meeting compliance mandates
59641 all signs point toward a bleak fiscal future for the federal government massive deficits and the costs of overseas conflicts mean fewer resources for programs and some tough budget decisions if cfos stay on the present path of financial management they will be of little use in making those decisions
59642 we are getting as on our tests but not learning anything
59643 there is a sense in the federal community that cfos are not relevant because they are consumed with issues that have nothing to do with managing the mission of an entity
59644 if compliance requirements are about things that are not important to running an entity and they consume a lot of time then the system is broken
59645 what a hollow victory it would be if in the future more entities succeeded in meeting more and tougher financial compliance requirements yet added little value to government missions and operations
59646 its time to go in a new direction one in which program offices and nonfinancial executives are the main customers for financial information not just auditors
59647 continuing resolutions hurt us the most in the area of program integrity which is funded last in priority program integrity includes risk management facility maintenance etc in continuing resolutions people abandon looking at return on investment and do the immediate thing rather than what will be important in the long term
59648 hr lob providers such as avue were required to prove their solutions through a rigorous screening and evaluation process including four days of operational capabilities demonstrations and on site visits to assess it security
59649 tsa failed to conduct even a single demonstration or site visit instead it relied exclusively on written proposals one oral presentation and one follow on q amp a
59650 the unnecessary expenditures associated with this award alone will wipe out that return
59651 cannot ascertain why tsa would award the contract to lockheed if purely on the merits
59652 does not have an operational technology platform and must develop a new one for tsa
59653 another step down the wrong path by a troubled agency
59654 afge believes that lockheed martin would like to take over the duties of the federalized screener workforce and so stands to gain by demonstrating that the federalization of screening duties has been a failure

59698 it did its best to keep above 94 us cents but it looks like it just gave way to selling pressure this morning
59699 the real danger for the rba as far as they are concerned is that they dont want to step in too quickly and start cutting rates when there is still inflationary pressures to some extent in the market
59700 they want to be very much certain that a rate cut is warranted
59701 i know other families have losses some even have the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child but to lose a child to murder shattered ones belief in humanity

59706 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
59707 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
59708 for cooperation among the various greek american congressional lobbying groups
59709 our local justice for cyprus committee has been working since 1955 on the issue of cyprus both nationally and in the chicago area yet the major greek american congressional lobbying groups have not worked together and this lack of unity is hurting our cause we need collaboration and a national strategy otherwise our time effort and money will continue to have limited value it is a shame that we cannot obtain a meeting with the u s secretary of state because she would have to meet separately with each lobbying group as assistant secretary of state nicholas burns did in 2006 by being divided we diminish our effectiveness
59710 i do not believe the local communal talks between the greek and turkish cypriots will succeed and the eu will not admit turkey in this era of islamic extremism we have concluded that only firm action by the u s government will effect a settlement in cyprus it is our hope that a unified greek american lobby and a new administration in washington will be a catalyst to that end

59720 lets use the example of friendship and how removing the element of life from a verb can drastically alter a relationship if you and i are friends there is an expectancy that exists within our relationship when we see each other or are apart there is expectancy of being together of laughing and talking that expectancy has no concrete definition it is alive and dynamic and everything that emerges from our being together is a unique gift shared by no one else but what happens if i change that expectancy to an expectation spoken or unspoken suddenly law has entered into our relationship you are now expected to perform in a way that meets my expectations our living friendship rapidly deteriorates into a dead thing with rules and requirements it is no longer about you and me but about what friends are supposed to do or the responsibilities of a good friend
59721 but despite not always understanding my dad or agreeing with him i love him
59722 there are so many variables and it seems like all the people in my life want something different from me then i wonder when do i get a vote

59740 mr pickens figures that his plan would save the u s about 300 billion a year in addition to cleaning up the environment but theres a vicious circle in place wind cant become a bigger part of the electricity mix until theres a new batch of transmission lines and nobody is willing to foot the bill for new power lines until theres a lot of juice to move plus a lot of communities hate the idea of big power lines plowing across their land mr pickens says hes ready to pay for his own private transmission lines to get his wind farm spinning but to really take off nationwide wind power needs a national solution the senate heard western governors are teaming up with counterparts in mexico and canada to build their own clean energy networks across state boundaries but so far the patchwork of federal and state regulations and permits is acting as a brake on wind powers growth that means washington has to act mr pickens said by tackling prickly questions like eminent domain and right of way across big swathes of federal land
59741 hydrocarbon fuels created america gave us the technologies and living standards we enjoy today enabled us to eradicate diseases that plagued earlier generations and boosted our life expectancy from 50 in 1900 to nearly 80 today
59742 u s offshore oil drilling is not perfectly tidy its only 99 999 percent clean indeed since 1980 as mms figures indicate 101 997 barrels spilled from among the 11 855 billion barrels of american oil extracted offshore this is a 0 001 percent pollution rate while offshore drilling is not 100 percent spotless this record should satisfy all but the terminally fastidious ironically in terms of oil contamination mother nature is 95 times dirtier than man some 620 500 barrels of oil ooze organically from north americas ocean floors each year compare this to the average 6 555 barrels that oil companies have spilled annually since 1998 according to mms
59743 its not a situation where you would expect any world records to be broken
59744 athletes breathe in ten times as much air into their lungs as spectators
59745 the pollution will cause their lungs to decrease in diameter so they will not be able to take as much air into their lungs which will affect their performance
59746 some of the athletes will suffer severe reactions and all will see impacts on their health
59747 they are pushing their bodies to their limits so pollution will have serious consequences
59748 douching itself offends me and is part of a patriarchal marketing conspiracy to make women think they smell bad down there
59749 so calling someone a douchebag is not an insult to women but an insult to those who make retarded products
59750 the issue of umnos offer to pas therefore does not arise
59751 we have decided anyone can meet but such meetings must be informed to the party just like in the past where the party was informed
59752 i only said meetings in general you can call it by any name
59753 i have said before that this issue must be solved according to islamic principles
59754 umno must not forget its partners mca mic and gerakan although they are only a shadow of their former selves tunku abdul rahman once said that if mca only has three members he will still stand by them
59755 so any negotiation must involve their partners as well sabah and sarawak feel they deserve better treatment and if there is any goodies being given to pas they wouldnt like that
59756 of course datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi would like to achieve his two thirds majority and he can get it if pas joins barisan nasional pas on the other hand is not very happy with being the smallest party in the opposition where the biggest say goes to pkr parti keadilan rakyat
59757 it is like crossbreeding a cat and a kambing goat we know that it is now a science but it is a difficult science and we have not been able to make such a clone yet
59758 i would like to see how pas gives up hudud law islamic criminal law and umno embraces it
59759 it is sad that we should play host to a war criminal
59760 thus the malaysian government has agreed that it has no right to touch the causeway even on its side of the strait of tebrau unless it obtains the permission of the singapore government
59761 any attempts to delay the by election which must be held within 60 days after the election commission is notified or to arrest him or charge him in court will be seen by his supporters as a form of victimisation
59762 also he is already scheduled to address the people in permatang pauh this saturday its a well thought plan to pre empt bns efforts to derail his political agenda
59763 im not surprised if anwar can increase the number for the constituents they know they are going to vote for a prime minister
59764 it will even be better than the recent general election we have received news that the local pas leaders will begin to mobilise their election machinery to help us even dap members are excited about this
59765 hey if youre in there youre about to get locked in
59766 coping with the inevitability of change our challenges chances and choices
59767 most retailers charge more for their premium low turnover inventory than for their high volume mercandise its just basic business fundamentals at work
59768 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
59769 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof

59774 having financial partners that know our business is critical to ensuring that they have the expertise to contribute to our success
59775 the dph has been tremendously concerned with the number of fatal and nonfatal opiate related overdoses in massachusetts
59776 weve seen a dramatic increase since the late 90s in fatal and nonfatal overdoses
59777 that to me speaks to the tremendous need for the program
59778 we had known from speaking to parents groups of their desire to use narcan but the breakdown of addicts to relatives enrolled in the program has been surprising to us
59779 narcan is a very safe nontoxic drug that is not difficult to administer
59780 from my experience its not a good drug to just be out there
59781 you better be sure you know what youre doing when youre using it
59782 people have expressed to us that having the medication gives them peace of mind when they are living with a loved one who has an opiate addiction problem
59783 narcan distribution hopefully will begin to bring people and communities together to meet a common goal saving lives
59784 belushi hunted me down and found me in an arbitrary home in santa cruz
59785 this cocaine dealer came up and yanked on my pant leg and said john belushi wants to meet you

59790 youve got to ask ray charles about it ray charles plays piano on it not only that he arranged the song
59791 i started bringing him records which consist of count basie magic sam little walter sonny boy williamson howlin wolf slim harpo jimmy rushing on and on
59792 i got up on stage and i shook up a beer and sprayed the audience so the audience shook up their beers and sprayed the band
59793 so belushi and aykroyd went out and bought the best band money can buy and this phone call was about what do i think of this band
59794 curtis is one of the top five soul singers in the world
59795 belushi hunted me down and found me in an arbitrary home in santa cruz
59796 this cocaine dealer came up and yanked on my pant leg and said john belushi wants to meet you
59797 i was headed toward the girls and this guy grabs my arm and shakes my hand
59798 i go like hi what he goes my names john belushi i go yeah nice to meet you i was kind of cocky you know i dont care ive got other things to do and i dont know who he is
59799 i start picking up that this guys an actor or something
59800 so then he says hes in this show saturday night live and ive never seen it so now he figures out i dont know or care who the f he is then he says im doing this thing with ray charles on the show and i flipped
59801 youve got to ask ray charles about it ray charles plays piano on it not only that he arranged the song
59802 i started bringing him records which consist of count basie magic sam little walter sonny boy williamson howlin wolf slim harpo jimmy rushing on and on
59803 i got up on stage and i shook up a beer and sprayed the audience so the audience shook up their beers and sprayed the band
59804 so belushi and aykroyd went out and bought the best band money can buy and this phone call was about what do i think of this band
59805 curtis is one of the top five soul singers in the world
59806 they gave me painkillers and i said lord have mercy i remember this
59807 when i got clean i probably had half my liver that was fine after 20 years hepatitis had eaten my liver to the point of level 4 cirrhosis theres only five stages after that its end stage liver
59808 it was cancer and i had eight months to live
59809 and was it scary when they give you eight months yeah its either get this out or youre dead
59810 i think its a rough spot now for anyone who is self employed
59811 self employed and or a musician if you have to take off a couple of months for any illness its pretty hard i mean we find it hard to take two weeks off for vacation
59812 the money has been loaned to him throughout all of this and he certainly does owe a great deal of debt
59813 if youre self employed or an artist or whatever its just so expensive to buy health insurance
59814 a lot of people dont because they would rather keep their touring van in working condition theyd rather pay their players a little more money because their so grateful for how hard their working for people like candye and curtis not only do they have the medical payments they havent been able to work
59815 a lot of other countries would see a curtis salgado and realize this is an artistic treasure of our country lets fund these people
59816 curtis was the first person to call me in the hospital
59817 he said i was just calling you for a new years gig you cant die i have to go before you be careful what you say it all came around horribly wrong for us
59818 i had eight months in a miracle i got the liver out in seven
59819 they said youve got a 50 50 chance it will come back
59820 it did into my lung so now my left lung is smaller than my right lung
59821 so far ive had two clean checkups in a row and im hoping for three four five and six
59822 when that starts to happen then they start saying we think we missed it but right now im high risk
59823 on the road more than any of us he makes wisecracks
59824 i visited him in the hospital in omaha when he was waiting for a liver
59825 he just kicked deaths ass and said no way man im not ready whenever i get whiny i think about curtis and a couple of other friends and what theyve been through and i shut the f up
59826 he handled it well for someone who was told they only have so many months to live
59827 all he wanted to do was play his music and hopefully survive theres a couple of weeks every three months where he keeps quite you know hes thinking about it
59828 none of us want to go it drifts across your consciousness then you dont think about it then one moment you think about it the doctor said it would screw with your head im very very lucky so far i have been blessed ive dodged the bullet twice
59829 i drank my share and i used drugs my share
59830 twenty years of being clean and sober and alcohol and drugs still took me people dont realize that what they do young is going to catch up to their body later on your body remembers
59831 its all about the ensemble and the sound hes helped me learn how to take a look at the team and make the whole band sound better
59832 when i was a kid i could go thats buck clayton on trumpet thats walter page on bass thats jo jones on drums thats freddie green on guitar thats count basie on piano thats lester young on tenor saxophone thats eddie
59833 the thing that really put me over the edge was hate to see you go by little walter
59834 it was the toughest damn blues album ever after that paul butterfield kind of drifted out of there
59835 we go from 1958 b b king then jump to muddy waters then to sly stone funk you have to know the little idiosyncrasies thats what makes it fun for me
59836 he was cool about making sure i knew he wasnt a jerk about it but theres no beating around the bush its been an amazing learning experience
59837 when i joined the band my gramma said he may be white but he sounds just like b b king
59838 it raises the issue how much of how we feel how much of who we are as people is dictated in terms of our immune system
59839 a little depressed behavior is a survival mechanism in that sense
59840 one of my most positive patients had been battling cancer for years yet four weeks into the cytokine therapy she was distraught
59841 she told me i love my husband and my children but i dont want to be around them
59842 depression was the first sign we had that an animal was sick
59843 people would call in and say that the dog is sleeping more than usual they give the dog its favorite treat and it only nibbles at it and then drops it or theyd say the cat looks scruffy
59844 while in the cave the organism rests but keeps one eye open
59845 its a good thing if youre running from a tiger
59846 youd want to rev up your immune system to prepare for an injury
59847 the fact that stress can activate the innate immune response has been a major breakthrough
59848 among other things we see a drop in levels of serotonin the feel good chemical
59849 would provoke a high rate of side effects mainly gastrointestinal pain and possibly bleeding
59850 the further upstream you go towards the cytokines the more far reaching the effects on the body if you move downstream to block cells that are activated by the inflammation you may have a drug that is less toxic
59851 the evidence is clear at this point that inflammation events can lead to a depressed mood
59852 ideally there could be a drug where one size fits all but that doesnt seem to be the case
59853 we want to bring to peoples attention the interaction between factors
59854 people who dont respond to those therapies seem to have increased levels of inflammatory markers
59855 from inflammation to sickness and depression when the immune system subjugates the brain
59856 the evidence is clear at this point that inflammation events can lead to a depressed mood the issue is how often this is the case
59857 team splash water haha j p that joke was horrible but team spalsh is looking to soak their competition damn another weak joke but anyways on this occasion
59858 i was surprised to see us play so well considering it was our first time playing together
59859 there is no way you guys remix will beat highlander

59861 the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe
59862 your father was a good man he understood the value of life and only wanted to protect you
59863 last night she made a casserole with 147 ingredients and it still tasted bad its hard to believe that out of 147 ingredients not one of them tasted good of course i ate it anyway if you dont eat it mom gives you the speech on hard work and how the hungry children in wheretheheckistan would just love her casserole it seems to me the kids in wheretheheckistan have enough problems without dumping moms casserole on them too
59864 in the midst of the shootout were moua who is khangs wife and their six children who range in age from 3 to 15 moua said her family has since abandoned the house and can no longer afford to keep it

59867 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
59868 this is the first time im out with my friend naked ive never done this before
59869 what kind of music do you like to listen to
59870 when you go into a record store pick up billboard magazine and go to rock you have hard rock you have adult contemporary you have all these different sub genres of rock
59871 country music is the only genre still to this day that has not been sub categorized
59872 you go to the record store and you got hank williams sitting next to kenny chesney and its two completely different things
59873 when youre talking to somebody about this kind of music you have to say that youre alternative country just to make them understand that youre not kenny chesney or tim mcgraw
59874 i believe wayne hancock said it best when somebody told him his music was alternative country and he said the alternative to what
59875 she bought a hank williams cd and put it on while we were driving home
59876 14 years later i still listen you know just about every day ill have something to do with him
59877 its just a product of the society we live in
59878 i mean look at everything else how much other stuff do you see out there today thats really authentic everythings got this over glossed type of mentality the realistic side of life you know the pain death and bad things happening i guess its just better off to pretend its not there
59879 duh bosen banget aku harap aku juga punya pacar yang bisa berbagi waktu denganku

59895 its like a death in the family i went through steps in grieving at some point depressed sometime angry that it didnt work out
59896 its pretty amazing its pretty amazing so many individuals who werent trained to do that sort of thing were offering assistance rather than standing back and being in awe of everything
59897 having an anniversary on the bridge almost doesnt seem right people lost their lives people were hurt and it just doesnt seem like something you should celebrate

59908 full of striking power chords and tons of destruction austrian death machine does have a solid rhythm section that rivals any metal group recently or from the past
59909 there are elements of metalcore and thrash and every song has a blazing guitar solo the songs are very catchy and the cheesy lyrics make them that much more memorable its a fun project from tim lambesis that will make you laugh and the quality of the music makes it more than a novelty

59913 the united states olympic committee paralympic program act of 2008
59914 over the coming weeks as the olympic and paralympic games unfold we will witness the power of sport to bring nations together to promote fair and friendly competition and to inspire us with great performances
59915 sport also has the power to rebuild lives as weve seen so often through the paralympic programs and events we host in colorado including at the united states olympic training center in colorado springs service members and veterans who are recovering from an injury or a disability should have broad access to these programs this bill will help by establishing a strong partnership between the va and the usoc and by providing additional opportunities for our veterans particularly those who are returning from iraq and afghanistan to engage in paralympic sports i am proud that this bill has the support of the american legion the paralyzed veterans of america disabled sports usa and the international wheelchair and amputee sports federation and look forward to working with my colleagues to pass it
59916 we are of the view that it would be singularly unwise to be committing australian men and women into theatres of operation without a clear understanding why we are going there what and how we are seeking to achieve it and when the job is done and when the men and women are coming home
59917 it would just be bad bad policy to do that
59918 the relevant agencies were unable to provide us with the level of mental health data the level of detail that we required
59919 you feel that you have done 120 per cent for the australian defence force and the country and when you come back you become ill and all the adf seem to be doing is wanting to get rid of you
59920 the dni is firmly in charge now and thats a good thing
59921 this is part of a systemic problem of the administration and i said im not going to take it anymore
59922 we understand that this research was conducted up to a year ago our own more recent research shows that young people are supportive of the games coming to london and want to be part of it
59923 weve undertaken a lot of activities in the past year aimed at young people in particular
59924 we took a road show to 27 cities all around the uk last year and over 50 000 youngsters tried a new sport at these roadshows we are taking a similar roadshow around london in the next few weeks
59925 they are not going to build all those stadiums in time it just isnt going to happen theyve already spent billions more than they should have

59932 first there is no clear international standard second there is no clarity about the justification for customs action in relation to goods in transit or transshipment third all transshipment cases cannot be dealt with on the same basis fourth in sa at least the laws are contradictory and do not take into account the ordinary principles of criminal procedure fifth customs are not really equipped to deal with the problems and last the issue is more often than not one of fact and not one of law
59933 about two dozen bombs were discovered in the city some at unlikely places tucked behind hoarding bills and up on trees but no one appears to know who first spotted a bomb the police seem to have been tipped off about most of the bombs by one group of bjp activists but in most cases they werent the ones who spotted the bombs they were told about it by others now in being asked they seem to have forgotten who were the people who told them about the bombs
59934 theyve had good experience working with her i checked with everybody i could check with within the university groups and she came out as the consensus favorite everywhere that i checked so i have great confidence that she can restore the facultys trust
59935 i think the trust is going to be hopefully built based on what faculty see as the result the next time around
59936 in my opinion it would be naive to think that the summit itself could restore trust
59937 i think were going to have to see some positive results and that wont happen until the spring
59938 the summit was a good first step and i think some good work came out of the summit how all that plays out this year will be the test as to whether weve made progress but i will say this i trust elizabeth completely to understand the process and let the process work as it should
59939 davis is viewed as very competent and very fair so i think this bodes well if we can keep up this consultation between administration and faculty
59940 i do not think we will have any trouble filling up the building especially now that hillcrest and scott amp white are partnering
59941 if i was sitting here with no sales and no buildings up yes i would be very concerned
59942 but waco nissan is in place and theyre starting work on incommons bank and other than the transitional care facility and the restaurants all the other deals weve talked about are closed and funded meaning they will get done

59950 our results strongly suggest that the reason that some children whove been given antibiotics appear to develop asthma is because they had a chest infection and the symptoms of the chest infection in young children can be confused with the start of asthma antibiotics are then given to treat this respiratory condition which may or may not be asthma and are not a cause as has been previously suggested
59951 however our study still leaves open the possibility that antibiotics have something to do with the development of eczema and itchy skin by four years and allergic hypersensitivity by 15 months
59952 devon butler is an eight year old who dreams of being a cop he watches police tv shows knows police procedures and plays cops and robbers with his friend ray one day while snooping around in a warehouse he witnesses a murder he goes to the police who want the information but wont get it until they make devon a cop the police then team him with veteran cop and child hater nick mckenna and the two team up in comic series of events to find the killer

59964 its going to be highly virtualized in all dimensions from the servers to the storage to the network and even application virtualization
59965 its green by design so the building has a high degree of recyclable materials and it is very energy efficient
59966 from a workload perspective this facility will show ibm using the cloud computing model and the service delivery model to deliver services in a much more scalable and economic fashion to our outsource clients
59967 we are delighted to have reached this important point and are looking forward to seeing the cars in showrooms shortly
59968 animals and birds are lucky they dont keep acquiring things the way men do you can teach a monkey to drive a motorcycle but i have never known a monkey to go out and buy a motorcycle
59969 im not reading that but it was interesting and i really fell in love with the characters
59970 now i am wanting to venture out and read more
59971 this is a government that has come to the end of its road
59972 the right thing to do when the prime minister goes is to let the people choose who will lead them
59973 i believe we will have elections in february or march and until then olmert will be prime minister
59974 but to say its realistic i dont know i see very large obstacles in the way
59975 estilo de juego que le atrae y que le va bien a sus cualidades
59976 the fact is that the machinery of american democracy is broken mistakes inaccuracies chicaneries snafus frauds fiascos and disasters debilitate almost every race everywhere every two years with the result that increasing numbers of americans report feeling alienated by the voting process its no exaggeration to say the problem has reached the level of a national emergency
59977 what happens if some it comes into our real life
59978 es como una m quina del tiempo para la web
59979 hay una innegable necesidad de buscar filtrar e interactuar con el volumen de noticias e informaci n que se transmite por twitter cada segundo
59980 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
59981 china has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future
59982 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
59983 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
59984 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
59985 sleep disordered breathing and mortality eighteen year follow up of the wisconsin sleep cohort
59986 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
59987 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
59988 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
59989 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
59990 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
59991 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
59992 our impact measure more accurately gauges what is going on in the classroom which is the way schools really should be evaluated if were trying to determine their effectiveness
59993 we cant evaluate schools assuming that they all serve similar kinds of children
59994 if we evaluate schools that way things change quite a bit as far as which ones we would identify as failing
59995 it suggests that many schools serving disadvantaged kids are doing a good job with children who face a lot of challenges
59996 these schools may be serving children from advantaged backgrounds who do well on achievement tests but the learning rate for their students isnt dramatically faster when they are in school versus when they are not in other words these schools are not having much positive impact
59997 we are not pressuring the schools that need to be pressured
59998 when you shift the focus from achievement to impact there are still schools that do very well and some that do poorly
59999 but they are not necessarily where you think they are there are high impact schools in every kind of neighborhood serving every kind of child the same is true of low impact schools
