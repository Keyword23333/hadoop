60000 if theres a school that rates high in educational impact but low on achievement maybe the school should have a summer program with those same teachers who are having such a positive impact
60001 thats certainly more appropriate than saying something must be wrong with this school because of the low achievement scores
60002 rather than use those six tests for low quality information lets redistribute them differently to get quality information about the schools
60003 we would have the same number of tests but information that is substantially more useful
60004 with working memory youre just keeping it active until you use it
60005 thats the test where we really saw the most striking effects with estradiol
60006 rats treated with estradiol are definitely a lot more active and make a lot more lever presses
60007 women take them thinking theyll be a safe alternative to hormone replacement therapy and they might help hot flashes
60008 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
60009 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large in our particular study a six fold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
60010 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
60011 people who have or suspect that they have sleep apnea should consult their physicians about diagnosis and treatment options
60012 sleep apnea as an independent risk factor for all cause mortality the busselton health study
60013 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunologic approach to exploit this window of opportunity
60014 the good news was the surprisingly nice t cell response patients had to the flu vaccination even relatively soon after completing chemotherapy
60015 that shows that the general idea of using immunotherapy following chemotherapy to prevent recurrence is not a flawed one chemotherapy depleted the immune system but we could restore it
60016 was not very immunogenic we have a long way to go to optimizing this vaccine
60017 foreigners must respect chinese laws while in china and must not harm chinas national security or damage social order
60018 we found that both men and women with sleep apnea in the general population not patients mostly undiagnosed and untreated had poorer survival compared with persons without sleep apnea given equal bmi age and sex
60019 i was surprised by how much the risks increased when we excluded people who reported treatment with cpap
60020 our findings suggest but cannot prove that people diagnosed with sleep apnea should be treated and if cpap is the prescribed treatment regular use may prevent premature death

60024 wandering through the quadrangles and medieval bastions of learning at the university of cambridge one overcast sunday afternoon a few months ago i found myself ruminating on how this venerable place had been a crucible for the scientific revolution that changed humankinds perceptions of itself and of the world the notion of cambridge as a source of grand transformative concepts was very much on my mind that day because i had traveled to england to meet a contemporary cantabrigian who aspires to a historical role similar to those enjoyed by francis bacon isaac newton and william harvey aubrey david nicholas jasper de grey is convinced that he has formulated the theoretical means by which human beings might live thousands of years indefinitely in fact perhaps theoretical is too small a word de grey has mapped out his proposed course in such detail that he believes it may be possible for his objective to be achieved within as short a period as 25 years in time for many readers of technology review to avail themselves of its formulations and not incidentally in time for his 41 year old self as well like bacon de grey has never stationed himself at a laboratory bench to attempt a single hands on experiment at least not in human biology he is without qualifications for that and makes no pretensions to being anything other than what he is a computer scientist who has taught himself natural science aubrey de grey is a man of ideas and he has set himself toward the goal of transforming the basis of what it means to be human
60025 hvis det er rigtigt s er det rgerligt at vi ikke dengang gen nemskuede direktivets konsekvenser

60027 det kr ver ikke den store akademiske uddannelse at gennemskue at det direktiv bet d fri indvandring til danmark
60028 det har vi sandelig ogs gjort ved masser af lejligheder vi stemte nej til det direktiv som regeringen sagde var endnu en velsignelse fra eu

60041 were huge fans of rock band and feel honored to join the rock band 2 game disc setlist with some of our favorite artists like the who bob dylan and journey
60042 and what better way to celebrate our involvement with the game than joining the first rock band tour were definitely excited to be a part of things
60043 with any luck ill win a spot on stage to show what i can really do
60044 we are not sure at todays date that the infrastructure will carry 100 units the existing down flow study has not been done water flow could be a problem
60045 i want to make sure the is and ts are crossed and dotted like theyre supposed to be
60046 ive got my guard up i favor the project its a great project but weve got to make sure were in line to do what we have to do
60047 this is not rocket science all were saying is lets go ahead and see what we can do
60048 he told the police he had nothing to do with this

60050 were going to turn the page were going to get younger for the last two months and were going to continue to develop young players we want players here that are going to hustle that are going to play the game hard and play the game right we just feel at this point we need to give younger players an opportunity and were going to do that
60051 its disappointing as i told felipe i traded for him twice im a fan of his talent his ability it didnt happen up here in washington im sorry for that and im sure hes sorry for that because he wanted to do better i love felipe we just couldnt get the talent out on the field and its time for us to go in a different direction and to do that i think its better we tried to deal him we werent able to do it i think its better for him and for the club to just part ways at this time but im rooting for him i hope he gets it together cause he sure does have a lot of physical talent
60052 they both took it professionally both of them extremely professionally and paul understands when he signed here he came to be the everyday catcher so we could develop jesus flores its not his fault that be broke his hand and got hurt jesus came up here and all of a sudden he was ready for the major leagues thats not pauls fault either it doesnt do him any good to sit on the bench here and not play and were in a situation where we want to develop our young players so were trying to help him as well to try to hook on with a contending team at the end of the year
60053 thats right we tried to move both of them that was our preference but when we got to the deadline today and didnt have any interest we just felt it was better to deal with it this way for our ballclub going forward difficult decisions i love both people but it just didnt work out here
60054 jim and manny just called me in there i apologized i feel bad im a better player than i played its just an unfortunate year i had the knee surgery and then just when i started to feel healthy i broke my hand i actually felt better at the plate the other night their reasons are verified definitely kory casto needs to play hes the future of this organization and a lot of these guys here and especially jesus they need to play them giving me my release is sort of a class act by them to give me a chance to hook up with another team big time class act like i said i apologize to the organization and to the fans im a better baseball player than i played its just an unfortunate year
60055 im going to go home and pack all my stuff im fortunate that i live in new york so its a four hour drive come back tomorrow pack my stuff and im going to the gym tomorrow im going to work out and go to the cages and stay fit and hopefully ill find another team
60056 sort of mixed im happy because i get a chance to maybe hook up with another team but im also sad too because you make a lot of friendships with these guys its been a rough year and weve grinded it out its not lack of effort guys are trying hard it just seems like theres a jinx especially with ryan zimmerman getting hit tonight its just unbelievable very sad like i said i wasnt able to produce for this organization and i feel bad when i signed here i was gung ho and ready to go and it just didnt work out
60057 no i think theyre making the right move other guys here need to play and im taking up a spot i dont mind youve got to be honest with yourself do i think i can play yeah most definitely im going to come back if it doesnt happen this year and im going to shove it to a lot of people believe me i can play this game i know i can its just unfortunate but like i said a lot of the young kids here need to play im not going to be here next year so those guys need to get at bats and learn up here this is an organization thats going to go in the right direction
60058 were looking into every option well see what happens to be honest with you i want to try to go to a team thats going to win but i want to play too so if a team gives me an opportunity to play the rest of the year im going to take it
60059 im going to root for every one of these guys theyre all very close friends of mine i invited a lot of them to my wedding
60060 things happen you never expect them anything can happen this is definitely not the end of me im still young im healthy it didnt go well for me here but its not the end of the world i wish everybody the best ive got nothing bad to say about the nationals
60061 to get released for everybody is not good but i understand the business they just signed a couple of young guys who deserve a chance just like i did when i went up i have nothing bad to say i wish those guys the best
60062 i dont know if i knew i wouldnt have been struggling i dont know what to say
60063 yeah i had opportunity i had playing time im not mad about that
60064 yeah this is not the way i play i have a lot of confidence in me sometimes i let my frustration show otherwise because i expect a lot out of myself but everybody here knows the kind of player i am i just have to keep battling and come out on top
60065 for people that play this game its hard when you struggle roll over a ball and cussing yourself out down the first base line that may look like not hustling to other people but its just frustration its not like showing anybody up or anything

60070 each time a man stands for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring these ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance for the fortunate among us there is the temptation to follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who enjoy the privilege of education but that is not the road that history has marked out for us like it or not we live in times of danger and uncertainty but they are more open to the creative energy of men than any other time in history the future does not belong to those who are content with today apathetic toward common problems and their fellow man alike timid and fearful in the face of new ideas and bold projects rather it will belong to those who can blend vision reason and courage in a personal commitment to the ideas and great enterprises of american society

60097 prince george has earned a reputation from coast to coast as one of canadas most enthusiastic theatre towns and a place where theatre folk are made so wonderfully welcome
60098 we love it no fuss no muss the actors come and go as they please and because of rehearsal schedules we sometimes dont even see them life doesnt change it just gets better

60114 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
60115 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
60116 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
60117 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails
60118 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
60119 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
60120 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
60121 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
60122 when he did it the first time yesterday we let it pass when he did it again later specifically linking us to it we decided to respond
60123 it is im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and we dont theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
60124 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
60125 campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have raised
60126 all theyre doing is churning out the same stuff they do every four years all you have to do is change the name
60127 so when you hear my opponent say hes too risky what theyre really saying is we know we dont have any good ideas but you should be worried about him
60128 it seems to me at this point it would be naive of the obama campaign not to anticipate efforts to tear at obamas character the way bush tore away at john kerrys character four years ago so if a fellow can rationally expect a swift boat full of funny racial angles racing at him he would only be sane to try to deflect that

60181 there is a perception out there that heat pumps are almost free to use that is not the case at all
60182 we dont think it would be uncommon for people who are running them really hard to incur costs of up to 5 a day
60183 more and more new zealanders are getting heat pumps so all retailers will be facing similar issues
60184 we have been promised efficient heating and therefore lower costs with a heatpump
60185 weve taken this action as a prudent response to the current extraordinary market conditions that have resulted in higher than usual redemptions in the fund not matched by fresh investment
60186 the amp capital nz property fund has investments in the amp capital property portfolio app and some listed property trusts the underlying property assets held in app continue to comprise a high quality nationwide portfolio of assets that are strongly diversified by location and property type such as office retail and industrial the portfolio has 96 per cent occupancy and includes the government sector as the single largest tenant on long term leases
60187 because property is a long term investment and the assets are not immediately realisable these types of provisions are common to these types of funds to ensure that the interests of investors are protected during periods of market volatility
60188 in the current market where investors are looking to reduce their exposure to property investments we believe we are acting in the best interests of investors by temporarily suspending activity to preserve the quality of the fund
60189 we have put the sector on hold at this point in time

60219 israel considers this to be a real and serious danger
60220 the israeli enemys persistence in its violations of lebanese airspace territorial waters and territory especially during the past few days is an unacceptable provocative escalation that calls for condemnation and serious action on the part of the concerned lebanese authorities as well as the un bodies
60221 i think they are oiling up their 57mm guns again
60222 the israeli overflights have increased lately and it looks like the israelis are provoking hizballah into showing their deployments
60223 they are allowing diplomacy a chance in order for it to fail
60224 by filing a quite unprecedented complaint they are holding the un and the lebanese government accountable which means hizballah is paving the way for a military response
60225 they need to keep some surprises left in case of another war
60226 we have to pay much more attention to the foreign market than we used to
60227 if you want to take pressure off price we ought to be sending a signal that the united states is going to find oil right here in our own hemisphere

60257 olmert two years after assuming office and promising to make israel a more fun place to live leaves us a nation in shame
60258 by making his intentions clear at this stage he will at least earn back some respect from his coalition colleagues and will be able to leave office on his own timetable rather than having the police and state attorneys office decide it for him
60259 it is also the smart thing personally at least as regards being able to better contend with the several legal proceedings now moving against him finally olmert did the smart thing historically and from the way he defended his entire term of office in his comments offering up a list of achievements during his shortened tenure as prime minister he was also clearly thinking as much of his long term legacy as he was his immediate fate
60260 during last nights resignation speech as the cameras zoomed in for a close up of olmerts red rimmed tear filled eyes the soon to be ex prime minister extolled his accomplishments he also praised israels democratic institutions which did not differentiate between an ordinary citizen and the prime minister in media follow up olmerts advisers tried to make him look like tony blair for most israelis however the prime minister seems more like another tony tony soprano
60261 the reality is simply a limit of available resources and unlimited ideas of how we can spend those resources for the greater good
60262 all this to save a debt based system that leaves our graduates with tens of thousands of dollars to be paid back over decades of compounding interest maybe the business reality is giving us a big hint about what the greater good really is
60263 i am saddened that the financial crisis has had such extensive a reach that financial institutions are not able to fund one of our nations most valuable investments education
60264 since many universities have amassed fantastic endowments see wikipedia on endowments now might be the time for them to tap those endowments to make loans on a temporary basis until conditions improve to their own students now there are obviously large disparities across universities in their endowments however i suspect that many universities are in a position to support such programs after all it would not represent a pure expense for the school in the form of a nonrepayable grant but rather an investment with a potentially healthy return
60265 is it good public policy put somewhat differently in light of the history of race and gender discrimination in america is the ujamaa school a worthy attempt to promote long term equality or a dangerous betrayal of the american ideal
60266 i did find it interesting that based on a justifiable skepticism in the prospect of truly integrated schools and an equally justified concern over the desperate condition of many inner city schools a slim majority of you favored the idea of a ujamaa type program

60299 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition

60314 i made an opinion about what i feel is a leagues decision about players going to england
60315 the form of danny buderus and michael crocker warrants their selection in this squad and if they continue on that form theyll warrant selection in regards to the world cup
60316 when you look at the players that theyve picked theyre very proven at this level
60317 theyre players that have been in good form for their clubs as well
60318 mitchell goes along with young wallace its very difficult but its a squad that theyve picked and were very happy with
60319 we will choose the final team of 24 on october 6 after the nrl grand final
60320 the final team can include players not featured in the squad announced today which serves to put players on notice that the cup is just around the corner and selectors are closely monitoring form
60321 the announcement is a reminder to those named that selectors are looking at them very seriously
60322 to those who are disappointed at not being named there is still some work to be done but they are by no means out of contention

60327 i negotiated a very tough deal he had to step down immediately from both his posts as president of the serb part of bosnia and as head of his party and he did so
60328 but when he disappeared he put out a piece of disinformation that i had cut a deal with him if he disappeared we wouldnt pursue him that was a completely false statement
60329 he should have been arrested his green mercedes was parked in its parking spot outside his office for six months after the 1995 dayton peace agreement each day the nato commander at the time refused to arrest him even though he had the authority to do so
60330 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
60331 said he was going to call former president jimmy carter his friend
60332 i didnt read into what sam said yesterday as anything other than what he said
60333 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think that you need to take him on face value
60334 he may say silly things from time to time but i dont think he lies and i dont think hes that silly to go down that track again

60352 it was kind of a taboo i just had to respect the pain and the family i just had to cope with it
60353 i was totally surprised because he had never said this before
60354 i made him wait two years to be sure that it was not just a daydream
60355 im quite used to having a lot of attention since the beginning when there was no reason to have attention it was just because of the name but now it is because of the name and because im doing quite well and maybe on the verge of going to f1 and i think people recognise my work

60458 american automakers believe that when it comes to increasing fuel economy raising the standards to 35 mpg by 2020 just cant be done but as members of the american auto industry we have designed built and sold automobiles in this country for decades and we know it can
60459 my family has been selling american made cars since 1936 my livelihood and the livelihood of over 350 employees who work for us depend upon the success of the automobile industry today that strength is severely compromised by the lack of fuel efficient cars and trucks customers want to buy the domestic automakers need higher standards for their and my survival without a 35 mile per gallon mandate im afraid global warming and our dependence on foreign oil will continue to get much worse in the long run and in the short run im afraid ill be stuck with a lot full of cars that no one wants to buy or even worse this country will no longer have an american auto industry so please join me sign our letter write your legislators and speak up and tell them that the powerful automobile lobby does not speak for you or our industry
60460 it pains me to be at odds with my own industry but the automakers do not have a good track record of embracing new technology they have fought laws requiring seat belts air bags catalytic converters as well as the original fuel economy cafe standard but each law spurred detroit to produce a better product and each law was important for the public good
60461 the technology to make our cars and trucks meet a 35 mile per gallon standard is on the road today
60462 having worked as manager of engineering in fords automotive fuel economy and emissions department for years i witnessed the company oppose every change while honda and toyota just used their talent to make those changes happen this opposition did not help the company one bit yet still they refused to change the senate standard is just the challenge that ford and other american automakers need to finally unleash their considerable talent and become leaders america needs to protect our environment and our industry
60463 an increase in fuel economy standards will not only benefit the country as a whole it will also move the industry forward create new jobs and boost profitability

60469 it also alerts motorists to begin to slow down so we can cut down on secondary accidents

60473 this is not a term you will hear from anyone associated with oil companies here is an article that is an exception to that rule
60474 i strongly believe double digit oil price is already history oil addicted economies the world over will have to reconcile to this fact and work out suitable solutions to insulate development from the oil price curve
60475 peak oil theory has kept every one guessing have we reached the peak or not quite yet we may not have a definite answer as of now but its effect is quite visible on the dynamics of the oil market now many oil geologists believe that 90 of the globes oil fields have already been tapped and many are already exhausted this is reflected in the report cards of oil mncs

60482 theres no question he was the most gifted athlete that i ever had in 40 years
60483 and i was blessed to have quite a few talented baseball players but ken by far was the top
60484 i really dont think kenny has changed a whole lot from high school
60485 but at the same time he grew up in an environment of professional athletics so he was kind of geared for that and knew that happened but hes human and he does have a sensitive side
60486 im definitely going to miss that but i also feel that its probably a good thing
60487 its a spectacular production weve never been able to accommodate this kind of show before
60488 youll be amazed when you see it for the first time
60489 for the cuff shorts but they can be taken down and then the inseam becomes 13
60490 watkins glen and bristol are two tracks where i really want a win
60491 i enjoy racing on the road course at watkins glen and for some reason always seem to be a little better there than sonoma weve had some top fives so hopefully this will put us in the win column
60492 as for the trucks i am really looking forward to that i have never run a truck race so it should be fun heck my brother jarit has run more than me but its going to be a good time
60493 the last couple of races the car has been the best it has ever been id like to continue with the momentum i have for sure
60494 the cars the best its been this year so it would be nice to score points this weekend and thats our aim
60495 it will be hot and tiring too so keeping your focus and concentration will be vital
60496 its not nice when its not going so well but its not the first time
60497 i had a wonderful experience and when i look back on my career i will always think about that i think it was really a turning point in my career and as a person
60498 i really dont know why michelle continues to do this we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men
60499 i think shes a very good person i feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction
60500 she was so good a couple of years ago when she finished second a few times im sure if you put yourself enough times in that position then you can deal with it and i think its how you become better thats how you learn to win
60501 we have got some great great players on the lpga right now obviously morgan pressel has won and paula creamer is a fantastic player and you have a bunch of young koreans
60502 i think if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win winning is what we are out here for but i just dont see the interest really on being on the mens tour i thought she had quit that idea but obviously not
60503 i dont know why youd want to pass up playing in a major especially the british open here at sunningdale
60504 but she goes a different path and thats not the path way that ive taken
60505 the government will never deal with the court it doesnt recognize it and will not appear before it

60516 that we needed to keep this group together and stand pat with what we have if we felt if i felt there was an opportunity to improve our team for the long term i would have done it
60517 we felt it was important to protect our starting pitching staff and keep our core together
60518 we also wanted to keep our bullpen intact its one of the best bullpens ive ever been associated with
60519 rich yet elegant the classy 01 philippe lorraine cabernet is a prime example of the softer european style of this varietal cabernet sauvignon with a pinch of cabernet franc produced from napa valley grapes north of yountville and aged for about 18 months in french oak carefully blended to achieve a balance of berry like flavors yet stay structured this is an excellent wine for marinated pork tenderloin

60526 were taking a stab at this until weve been in the building and have some history

60529 we believe 1 million is conservative it could be in excess of 2 million
60530 fred has to bring in 1 million in new revenue otherwise we havent levied enough tax money and we cant pay for this guys
60531 ive got a hunch that the numbers are skewed to city services being dispatched
60532 the city is increasing that budget and expecting us to come along
60533 i dont see how we have the money to do it
60534 we dont have the money sources you do you have the sacred cow the sales tax that we dont have we cant afford this
60535 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
60536 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
60537 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
60538 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since
60539 im like a nail stuck in the wrist of their christmas
60540 ive won big races before but this one has some extra special meaning because this place is so close to pittsburgh its cool to finally win a big race out in this area
60541 the only thing that couldve topped off tonight was if somehow troy polamalu was here to present me the trophy

60543 no you cant do that but you can do this
60544 you must be doing it wrong rick its dirty and disgusting
60545 fanfiction existed before the internet so its entirely possible nadia would be writing it even without the computer what she wouldnt have is the community that the internet brings
60546 the absolutely true diary of a part time indian was last years big ya book what i find so fascinating about that situation is that alexie published another book last year with a teenage main character a wonderful unique magical book called flight flight however was published as an adult book whats going on here
60547 even the most timorous teenage girl couldnt conceive of bella as intimidating its hard to imagine a person more insecure or a situation better set up to magnify her insecurities
60548 yes i have tried them i didnt feel they were worth the effort yes its cheap but you really have to spend alot of time with it and i dont think you can lighten more than a shade with pills
60549 much of what i have read about glutathione suggests you cannot take it in a supplement something to do with stomach acids and metabolism in your bloodstream the articles which are hard to find if you try to google them most pages are advertiders selling it say taking glutathione which is what this product contains would be a waste of time and money the research as i interpreted it shows the only effective way to increase your bloodstream glutathione content is with a whey supplement bodybuilders take it it contains lactoferrin and that triggers glutathione production supposedly so does raw unprocessed garlic

60553 generally the best time to prune anything deciduous is in late winter or early spring just before new growth emerges the worst possible time to prune is right after everything leafs out since the plants have just used up most of their stored energy and havent had time to replace it fall used to be thought of as a good time to prune deciduous material but spring is much better if possible plants store lots of energy in twiggy growth to help them overwinter and cuts will heal more quickly when the plant is getting ready to grow as opposed to shutting down
60554 but its not a life or death situation because its a win win for him either way
60555 anxiety levels will get high among everybody and i think at the end of the day well have two very good players
60556 is that he does care he wants us to win he wants us to be better i like all of that
60557 i understand why some people have trouble with him because he says things sometimes that im not sure he actually even means
60558 as long as i know that he really cares wants to win and wants us to get better those things are really important to me im satisfied that he feels all of those things
60559 and then we go through a period of time when it just isnt happening what im looking for more than anything else is improvement i just want to see the young ones get better and the veteran players play up to their capabilities a lot of the time you see that
60560 early on the pitching looked like it was going to be real solid then the pitching kind of faltered this may be the toughest year to assess that ive ever been involved with
60561 everyone whom i talked to without exception said this team is better than it was last year its not showing it in wins and losses but this team is better we should be playing better
60562 and im really pleased by the quality of the people hes brought into the organization i believe if we can be patient and thats tough tougher for me than anybody else well see the benefits
60563 the only answer for the fans is to produce some results
60564 the people who i talk to around town they want to see improvement they want to know that were headed in the right direction they want to win enough games that its fun to come to the ballpark
60565 if this team would jell and finish with a better record than last year not just a game better but much closer to 500 then i feel people would feel like were making progress and that next year is going to be even better
60566 well put them together but its up to them to get along and make the deal
60567 maybe you can butcher a cow and give them half
60568 i was giving him a hard time saying isnt there somebody who can take care of your farm for one weekend so you can relax
60569 his dad was too old and his brother was too busy with his own farm
60570 if we can find matches for them they want to jump in the motorhome and travel across canada looking after farms so people can get a break theyre retired farmers one couple is and they know how hard it was to get away from the farm
60571 born and raised on the farm it was just kind of second nature to help out people
60572 people that have been born and raised or actually worked around the farms thats the people you need to help out it sets the farmer at ease

60576 the centre is for the people and hence its present name the civic centre is ideal however if the building has to be named after a leader then we will press for sonia gandhis name the construction of the centre had started when the congress was in power if the bjp goes ahead with their decision we will complain to the lt governor
60577 our union had a meeting recently where it was decided that the name of the civic centre should be dr ambedkar centre this will be an important step for the country as it will reflect the emotions of the minorities

60582 theres lots of sand in them thats for sure its a tougher shot one golfer said after hitting out of one of the traps thursday
60583 as far as some of the bunkering systems here weve gone back to the old traditional bunkers theyre quite large a little rougher looking but they obviously play havoc with all of your golf shots
60584 this entire course has been transformed to bent grass tees greens and fairways
60585 its certainly going to be a tougher course to play its not as easy as the old one
60586 the response has been excellent said gordon mcivor vice president of clc a crown corporation that purchases and disposes of surplus federal property

60592 they may take our lives but they will never take our freedom

60595 its a great test of golf anne chouinard manager and head teaching professional at the canadian golf academy in stratford said thursday of the 18 hole championship course
60596 its a straightforward course nothing tricky about it you just need to make good shots and good decision making is important we expect a great event
60597 we hope to be competitive with any province she said
60598 obviously we have a smaller pool to pick from but we have a good young team it looks good for future teams for national events
60599 so that two or four or 10 years from now if somebody should ask where were you conyers and where was the united states congress when the bush administration declared the constitution inoperative and revoked the license of parliamentary government none of the company now present can plead ignorance or temporary insanity can say that somehow it escaped our notice that the president was setting himself up as a supreme leader exempt from the rule of law
60600 even with oil prices coming off a recent high consumers will be squeezed by high petrol and food prices rising home heating bills come winter and the continuation of the credit crunch until well into 2009
60601 we forecast that sales volumes will contract in july september the first such fall since early 2006 the next 12 months are shaping up to be the slowest period for retailers since the early 1990s
60602 our quarterly surveys have shown that there were 29 profit warnings by general retailers in the first six months of 2008 the highest number of warnings ever recorded by the sector in the first half
60603 in line with deteriorating economic fundamentals we believe even tougher times lie ahead with little evidence of a retail recovery until 2010
60604 it did its best to keep above 94 us cents but it looks like it just gave way to selling pressure this morning
60605 the real danger for the rba as far as they are concerned is that they dont want to step in too quickly and start cutting rates when there is still inflationary pressures to some extent in the market
60606 they want to be very much certain that a rate cut is warranted
60607 i know other families have losses some even have the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child but to lose a child to murder shattered ones belief in humanity

60612 doctors and patients not insurance companies should be making those choices we are so glad that the ama has taken a leadership role against the rampant discrimination that transgender people have faced for so many years in receiving appropriate medical care and equitable insurance coverage
60613 this certainly makes you think what would happen if a third partys train broke down on our rail line and stopped us being able to rail product to port to send to our customers
60614 last year the unions claimed that productivity gains in the industry were a direct result of good weather
60615 these reports shows productivity gains have been sustained and are not due to climate change effects
60616 this report categorically puts to bed union calls for the abolition of the abcc and further confirms what contractors have been reporting that the construction industry has seen a significant and permanent lift in productivity and industrial harmony since the abcc was established in 2005
60617 the gains made in recent years will be lost if the abcc is abolished immediately and if the powers of its replacement body are watered down in february 2010
60618 this would risk turning back the clock on the significant gains made over the past four years and potentially seriously undermine the economic gains which have delivered so much to the economy chief executive heather ridout said in a statement

60622 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
60623 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
60624 sam qualified this moments later when he realised he had been taken out of context
60625 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment
60626 i think it was a slip i understood what he said i didnt take the double meaning in it i understand why people might
60627 i know james brayshaw did and he took it up with sam
60628 im starting to really in some ways sort of question if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair
60629 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think youve got to take him on face value
60630 because you know im the only one who does things around here and if i didnt do it it would never get done and grumble grumble
60631 no podemos permitir que peque os pa ses perjudiquen a grandes empresas como esta empresas que han hecho grandes inversiones en todo el mundo
60632 there might be some days we look bad but you can see what we can do and i love it
60633 i dont think these guys ever lost any confidence early in the year
60634 we just didnt have some guys get into their game
60635 it was really just execution and production and guys not swinging the bats well weve really reversed that since we made the turn into july
60636 were getting guys in cripple counts and making them pay
60637 we are of the view that it would be singularly unwise to be committing australian men and women into theatres of operation without a clear understanding why we are going there what and how we are seeking to achieve it and when the job is done and when the men and women are coming home
60638 gee i just deep cleaned this washroom three weeks ago and its already needing to be cleaned again whats up with that
60639 no dont put that in the goodwill box i know ive never used it before and i know i dont even really know what it is but i really might need it someday

60642 apache understands the hardship that the varanus island incident has caused and thank everyone for their patience during this difficult time managing director tim wall said in a statement
60643 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
60644 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
60645 our businesses are in good shape integration is progressing well and delivering the synergies we targeted our customer base has grown and satisfaction across all brands continues to improve
60646 this assumes weather events remain within the groups normal provisioning and there is no further widening of credit spreads across the groups technical reserves portfolio
60647 obviously the lead from the us overnight wasnt particularly good
60648 the us has a tendency to move a couple of per cent either way each day at the moment so the volatility is quite extreme
60649 the only sectors which are offering any excitment is the energy sector
60650 things are still a little bit grim at the moment
60651 it can only be a matter of time before retailers the largest single employer in the country start to fire their workers
60652 the rba went too far with its rate hikes nobody wants to see retail spending falling as quickly as this
60653 the economy is slowing more abruptly than the rba expected people are responding to falling household wealth a slumping share market falling house values and falling disposable income because of high fuel and mortgage costs
60654 it has changed dramatically because everything is too expensive these days

60662 but when he disappeared he put out a piece of disinformation that i had cut a deal with him if he disappeared we wouldnt pursue him that was a completely false statement
60663 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
60664 he stole the ground from under our feet and he took the sky from above our heads he killed our sons
60665 and what we get in return is a theatre performance the world is looking at this as if it were a spectacle

60716 all of these preparation games are really important to get a feel for the ball for the different style of refereeing

60718 the mouse works fine in the desktop environment but for home entertainment or working on a notebook its over
60719 youve got panasonic showing forward facing video in the home entertainment environment instead of using a conventional remote control you hold up your hand and it recognises you have done that
60720 it also recognises your face and that you are you and it will display on your tv screen your menu you can move your hand to move around and select what you want
60721 sony and canon and other video and photographic manufacturers are using face recognition that recognises your face in real time
60722 you even have emotive systems where you can wear a headset and control a computer by simply thinking and thats a device set to hit the market in september
60723 is all about using computer power to do things smarter
60724 this just proves how important a device the mouse is
60725 todays tv works as a computer and todays computer works as a tv
60726 the devices we use have been modified for our changing lifestyles but it doesnt negate the value of the mouse
60727 the mouse will be even more popular than it is today as a result
60728 bringing technology education and information to these parts of the world will be done by accessing web browsers and doing that in the ways that we are familiar with today and that is using a mouse
60729 there are around one billion people online but the worlds population is over five billion

60732 even the multi touch interface is so much more powerful and flexible than in the past allowing you to zoom in scroll quickly or contract images
60733 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
60734 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
60735 sam qualified this moments later when he realised he had been taken out of context
60736 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment
60737 i think it was a slip i understood what he said i didnt take the double meaning in it i understand why people might
60738 i know james brayshaw did and he took it up with sam
60739 im starting to really in some ways sort of question if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair
60740 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think youve got to take him on face value
60741 it wasnt just his playing that made him special though he was an amazing performer it was also the clarity of his musical vision
60742 he took the violin as far as it could go there were no boundaries for him he had a way of bringing things out in other musicians that they didnt know were there he had such an adventurous spirit
60743 i want to promote poetry honour local poets and poetry in the community make poetry more than words on a page a way of paying attention and connecting to the people and things around us
60744 listening to the am radio in the 1930s they had jazz and symphony music coming from the same station
60745 there were no demographics then i grew up thinking music was a lot of things
60746 a full time composer who is also an improviser a conductor and a free association scat singer
60747 masai tribesmen in kenya country musicians in texas in a bell tower in holland and at a workshop in new orleans for 300 flutists
60748 improvising words and music on the spot and doing what feels right at the moment is what i have done since my days in the army in 1952
60749 we dont have to give out or take in any propaganda lets just hang out well be cool wherever we go
60750 two new songs i could play and sing in swahili
60751 i feel as strongly about farming and the people who are farmers as i do about people who i work with in music i was brought up on a farm its just something like music that gets in your blood seeing a farm a family farm not a factory farm but something thats run with love and care is as beautiful a work of art as any painting or any symphony its real its universal and its something that we all came from
60752 it makes staying together as a band more of a guarantee
60753 we have a pretty large instrumental capability flutes whistles harmonicas bouzoukis bassoons piano guitars squeezeboxes and were not afraid to use it ive played bassoon with the winnipeg symphony besides playing guitar matthew is also a concert pianist as a group weve got a lifetime of singing sacred music a cappella and in choirs its just a great big smorgasbord of sounds and influences
60754 one minute we were chatting about matthews lovely gretsch guitar and the next minute we decided wed work together on an album project
60755 traditional singing and dancing we were just born into it but we also research for new repertoire and olivier demers the fiddler he composes a lot of tunes so we have a mix of new and old
60756 taking it not as a historic thing but something that is still in movement
60757 when settlers first arrived 400 years ago they had bagpipes and hurdy gurdies
60758 it is very old born in the 12th century and at the same time its very modern because nobody knows it
60759 i think its like when i was young and i was listening to a lot of anglo saxon music and american music
60760 i didnt know anything about what the beatles were talking about but i loved it
60761 i still consider music as performing telling stories as well as playing music i have a hard time standing still
60762 when i started playing guitar i listened to joni mitchell and bob dylan that took me farther back to find out who they were influenced by hearing people like billie holiday and ella fitzgerald i kept digging farther back who was billie holiday influenced by bessie smith who was bessie smith influenced by minnie mccoy
60763 memphis minnie was really cool because she also played guitar
60764 im definitely a prairie girl i spent a year in victoria which is beautiful but i realized that im a prairie person
60765 clowned princes of humor purveyors of the absurd and ambassadors of fun
60766 what often comes first is the rhythm of a melody or the rhythm of a series of words that seems to lead me down the path to a song i love the rhythm of language
60767 as much as i like performing i love the creative aspect of songwriting it is wonderful to make something out of thin air i have done all kinds of writing i have written for theatre i have written for a specific demand can you write a song about grain handling but mostly i have written because i cant help it it is the way i express myself and most of all its fun to do
60768 my parents used to go to the aspen music festival in the summer when i was very young one day i saw the classical violinist nigel kennedy playing fiddle in a bluegrass band and heard banjos for the first time
60769 it was the first time id seen just a woman with a guitar that was a wow moment up to that point i had no idea
60770 for many people in canada the first time they ever saw musicians playing this music it was performed by local players at the town dance hall even early canadian television shows like holiday ranch would have the house band members decked out in stetsons and cowboy shirts playing western swing style music on fiddles and accordion it occurred to me that western swing may have been a much more important part of our canadian cultural heritage than many people realize
60771 i moved to ireland when i was six my folks got divorced my mother married an irishman and so we moved there baggage three kids my mom and my stepfather i was there for eleven years
60772 i think people have always recognized stephens abilities as a songwriter but youve had to see him live to know just how talented a guitarist and singer he can be
60773 with this album stephens finally going to get his due as a musician and performer
60774 stephen fearing is one of those artists that people hear at one point and remark on how good sounding he is both his voice and his instrumentation they promise themselves to check him out at a later point but then promptly forget to this promise is only remembered upon hearing fearing again this is unfortunate for the career of fearing who by the excellent quality of his work should be far more popular then he is
60775 to say well what is this song about is perhaps not as important as what it feels like
60776 love only knows what happens now yesterday turns under the plough only a fool would not allow you to stand on your own
60777 music is learned from a master in china always through formal conservatory training if you want to be a professional musician you have to have graduated from conservatory
60778 my first zheng teacher who is still living is the last generation of chinese folk musicians he taught me by voice and notation phrase by phrase hed sing the melody and in this way i was able to learn the traditional material
60779 i spent 15 years studying english while still in china i knew coming to canada was going to work out everything here its for me the value placed on culture and morals are very close to mine honest friendly courteous all these things i consider canada my home now
60780 there is no improvisation at all in chinese music randy taught me about free jazz and playing spontaneously
60781 i have also worked with bluegrass and folk musicians learning to improvise over chord progressions the zheng is a very neutral instrument and can embrace many others mandolin banjo slide and classical guitar ive learned to jam on 12 bar blues too
60782 guilian and zhimin are two of the finest players i know and with this group the musicianship is at a very high level
60783 friends from bracebridge had told me about this great festival in owen sound and said i would love it
60784 everyone looked so involved engaged and they were having fun
60785 id like to be a part of this the first year i volunteered at the information booth bill marshall came over to ask if id consider running for the board and i said yes
60786 part of the reason i wanted to come back for the third time was that we had a few years where our financial situation was a little precarious after 9 11 people werent travelling as much ticket sales were down and that was hurting the bottom line i saw that coming out in our annual general meeting and i wanted to come back to see if i could help fix that situation
60787 you have to have the structure in place that structure makes it possible for summerfolk to happen weve gone back to the folk festival model and people are happy about it a big wave of momentum has come back a large part of the success has been the amazing response from the grey bruce community
60788 we have a solid base of people who return year after year and i think thats something thats unique about us we have people who have volunteered for all 33 festivals at the same time we want to encourage younger people to get involved we have lots of vacancies for those who want to join in
60789 the other aspect in my role as president is also to look for volunteers to work on other folk society programs and initiatives throughout the rest of the year a lot of people know us as summerfolk but they dont realize were looking for volunteers to help with fundraising youth programs and all those kinds of things
60790 certain performances stay with you all year when youre running around working so hard on things and stop to think about some particularly good moments utah phillips performances for me were that
60791 odetta that was a thrill even gowan when he sang imagine that stays with me samba squad oh i loved them the experience and sound of the amphitheatre is unique to summerfolk there isnt another venue wed want to go to when you go into that amphitheatre and feel the sense of community thats a treasure and i particularly enjoy the workshop aspect the synthesis from bringing people together in the workshop sessions those are the unique things that you wont see any place else
60792 music by the people for the people and about the people
60793 its music from the heart and the mind i love music that makes me think about things when you hear a song that offers a new insight or a different take on an issue thats good stuff it can change your thinking it can change something in your life
60794 you should have seen them they were hammering and gluing to make wooden airplanes and having a great time it was amazing

60801 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity
60802 it was better than i expected the organisation was great and the music and atmosphere were fantastic
60803 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
60804 im disappointed that sen obama would say the things hes saying
60805 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
60806 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
60807 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
60808 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
60809 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
60810 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
60811 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
60812 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
60813 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
60814 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
60815 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
60816 comparing him to britney spears and paris hilton i was like ok
60817 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
60818 what we are talking about is who has an agenda for the future of america
60819 are you comparing barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton
60820 do you think hes a pretender and not a contender
60821 in fact i think hes very very strong and i admire his success i just believe theres substantive issues such as off shore drilling such as nuclear power americans are hurting because every time they go to the gas station theyre paying 4 a gallon
60822 i like all the ads my husband puts out ill leave it at that
60823 ive worked my entire adult life on children and women issues id like to continue to do that
60824 what i remember is a loud crashing noise and then being hit repeatedly by the car door and then being upside down and looking at the bottom of brians truck
60825 i pushed on the sidewalk or the curb to get my head away from the tire and then i got hit again by the door and that flung me over to the telephone poll over there

60839 i moved there for him he was gorgeous he was talented he was sexy
60840 the blacks and the unions killed this town vote republican
60841 the man and the rich white folks keep this city back vote democratic

60843 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
60844 it did its best to keep above 94 us cents but it looks like it just gave way to selling pressure this morning
60845 the real danger for the rba as far as they are concerned is that they dont want to step in too quickly and start cutting rates when there is still inflationary pressures to some extent in the market
60846 they want to be very much certain that a rate cut is warranted
60847 i know other families have losses some even have the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child but to lose a child to murder shattered ones belief in humanity
60848 the thoughtless and selfish act took tania from us forever and put an end to the bright future that would have been tanias
60849 we have had to endure a journey of hell frustration and pain searing pain that still to this day rips through my body
60850 we are of the view that it would be singularly unwise to be committing australian men and women into theatres of operation without a clear understanding why we are going there what and how we are seeking to achieve it and when the job is done and when the men and women are coming home
60851 american automakers believe that when it comes to increasing fuel economy raising the standards to 35 mpg by 2020 just cant be done but as members of the american auto industry we have designed built and sold automobiles in this country for decades and we know it can
60852 my family has been selling american made cars since 1936 my livelihood and the livelihood of over 350 employees who work for us depend upon the success of the automobile industry today that strength is severely compromised by the lack of fuel efficient cars and trucks customers want to buy the domestic automakers need higher standards for their and my survival without a 35 mile per gallon mandate im afraid global warming and our dependence on foreign oil will continue to get much worse in the long run and in the short run im afraid ill be stuck with a lot full of cars that no one wants to buy or even worse this country will no longer have an american auto industry so please join me sign our letter write your legislators and speak up and tell them that the powerful automobile lobby does not speak for you or our industry
60853 it pains me to be at odds with my own industry but the automakers do not have a good track record of embracing new technology they have fought laws requiring seat belts air bags catalytic converters as well as the original fuel economy cafe standard but each law spurred detroit to produce a better product and each law was important for the public good
60854 the technology to make our cars and trucks meet a 35 mile per gallon standard is on the road today
60855 having worked as manager of engineering in fords automotive fuel economy and emissions department for years i witnessed the company oppose every change while honda and toyota just used their talent to make those changes happen this opposition did not help the company one bit yet still they refused to change the senate standard is just the challenge that ford and other american automakers need to finally unleash their considerable talent and become leaders america needs to protect our environment and our industry
60856 an increase in fuel economy standards will not only benefit the country as a whole it will also move the industry forward create new jobs and boost profitability

60866 its not down but its marginally up in the low single digits our debit card spending on the other hand has continued to grow and is very robust
60867 we also do believe that the housing prices and the restrictions in credit for consumers have an impact on consumers utilizing their cards

60876 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
60877 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
60878 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
60879 if you want to take pressure off price we ought to be sending a signal that the united states is going to find oil right here in our own hemisphere
60880 theyre like a dog with a bone and theyre not letting go
60881 were not necessarily for drilling where they republicans want to drill
60882 the top five oil companies are now on track to hit 160 billion in profits for the year
60883 my republican colleagues are buying the line of big oil
60884 surely americans are tired of republicans delaying and rejecting every effort democrats make to solve our nations energy problems
60885 the american people are clamoring for legislation that will bring down the price of gas
60886 its time to act its time to stop playing politics
60887 were eating this same produce in mexico and we havent had any problems

60900 hey its past midnight and im drinking alone this cant be good for my health
60901 whee look at me im just like that popular guy who exercises in the back of comic books and helps scrawny nerds who have had sand kicked on them by sneering jackasses that or popular screen star johnny weissmuller
60902 there is no possible way for this scenario to end well my best case is falling with enough style to make the abrasions relatively minor
60903 so they can both be witnesses in case theres a criminal charge they have to write down every time you do something for the same reason
60904 short ring their drinks short change em buy drinks back after the first
60905 tonight was my last night so i figured id make a killing anyway
60906 now that im out of work can you give me a job
60907 the failures of the economy despite the fact that we grew for seven years to provide rising levels of income and wages for the american people i think indicates the degree to which weve got to fundamentally shift how we approach economic policy
60908 the bush policies are not the sole cause of the economic problems but they have not helped
60909 more of the same thats what john mccain is offering
60910 john mccains policy is all around creating jobs that is the no 1 priority for the tax policy
60911 the choice in this election is stark and simple sen obama will raise your taxes i wont
60912 if the tax cuts substantially raise the national debt the increase in borrowing by the federal government could crowd out private investment and consumers purchases of homes and durable goods which could slow the economy
60913 you will be providing for the needs of the main campus for the next decade
60914 you will be making an investment in the future at a time when there is uncertainty
60915 something that should have been done a long time ago
60916 we do not appreciate what we have until we lose it

60919 dan jikalau kami jadikan al quran itu suatu bacaan dalam bahasa selain arab tentulah mereka mengatakan
60920 al quran itu adalah petunjuk dan penawar bagi orang orang mukmin dan orang orang yang tidak beriman pada telinga mereka ada sumbatan sedang al quran itu suatu kegelapan bagi mereka
60921 we told him that this cannot happen unless the land is returned to the shrine board
60922 one of my first comments to barack was what the hell are you doing here
60923 o k that makes sense and sounds great as id like to go to the moon but right now ive only got enough gas to go this far
60924 i learned that if youre willing to listen to people its possible to bridge a lot of the differences that dominate the national political debate
60925 i pretty quickly got to form relationships with republicans with individuals from rural parts of the state and we had a lot in common
60926 we could barely have meetings in caucus because donne and rickey would give him hell
60927 donne would be just because youre from harvard you think you know everything
60928 he is a very bright but very ambitious person who has always had his eyes on the prize and it wasnt springfield if he deserves to be president it is not because he was a great legislator
60929 he knocked off the incumbent so that right there gave him some notoriety
60930 and he ran unopposed which for a rookie is unheard of
60931 what if a politician were to see his job as an organizer as part teacher and part advocate one who does not sell voters short but who educates them about the real choices before them
60932 its power politics and its politics as a business and its winning and control
60933 the mind set is it is not the publics business thats part of the culture its about the politicians and the politicians own the company
60934 part of it was that the seat opened up i was living in the district and the state legislature was a part time position it allowed me to get my feet wet in politics and test out whether i could get something done
60935 well when he came here first got elected he came to me
60936 and he said to me you know me you know me quite well
60937 they would bark their displeasure at me and then theyd unload on obama
60938 i know he wanted to limit contributions by corporations or labor unions and he certainly wanted to stop the transfers of huge amounts of money from the four legislative caucus leaders into rank and file members campaigns
60939 but he knew that would never happen so he got off that kick and thought disclosure was a more practical way to shine sunlight on what sometimes are unsavory practices
60940 put senator obama on a launching pad and put the mantle of ethics legislator on his crown
60941 i remember rickey chiding obama that what do you know barack
60942 wealthy kind of people the same kind of people who vote against pay raises who dont need 5 000 a year whereas senators like me from poorer communities we could use that 5 000
60943 made some compromises that other members of the black caucus just werent willing to bend on
60944 im not saying he gave up too much in hindsight it was best to go ahead with the weaker version because a lot of police attitudes changed when we passed it
60945 that forming relationships a lot of times was more important than having all the policy talking points in your arsenal that most of the time people at the state level and in the u s senate are moved as much by whether or not they trust you and whether or not they think your values are sound as they are by graphs and charts and numbers on a page
60946 youre nuts we cant support him i said when you know him like i know him youll all support him the largest percentage in the primary came from my county he carried every precinct
60947 im not going to think about that at all because if you think about making the cut thats all you think about
60948 you think about other players you start thinking about what position youre in and you start thinking about what you have to do all im going to think about tomorrow is how am i going to make a putt how am i going to hit a fairway
60949 it would be great if i could drive it these distances at sea level
60950 freedom democracy and civil rights they currently exhibit are questionable at best
60951 they meaning blacks have their own high school but they wont go to it they broke all the windows and destroyed it it was better than our own high school negroes dont want an education if they did they wouldnt refuse to go to their own high school and wouldnt have destroyed it
60952 jesus loves the little children all the children of the world red or yellow black or white jesus loves them all
60953 in modern day football the role of a wing back is becoming more important if we have one or two good wing backs in the team we can create more openings it is a wonderful sight seeing the wing back fly up and down the touchline terrorising the opposition their role is more attacking than the and it basically involves a great deal of running they are a nightmare to defend against as you never know where theyre going to be
60954 hot flat and crowded why we need a green revolution and how it can renew america
60955 important infrastructure which would not only prove to be beneficial during commonwealth games but would also become a permanent link between east south and central delhi
60956 it would serve as a dedicated corridor for movement of players
60957 increase in average travel speed will reduce fuel consumption pollution and loss of man hours and also reduce the maintenance cost of roads
60958 as people choose what causes to serve helping a herd of cows probably doesnt come to the forefront
60959 it is too hot but i still have many days to prepare i hope i could get used to it soon
60960 if they could provide some water or orange juice in the rest room for athletes it would be better
60961 she has been in hospital since tuesday morning due to high fever
60962 we have come here to win medals she is quite hopeful to win but who knows when she would recover
60963 negotiate the successful refinancing or restructuring of the groups capital structure
60964 the clearance of the pathwork test is another step in the continued integration of molecular based medicine into standard practice
60965 in the past scientists have classified different types of cancers based on the organs in which the tumors develop with the help of microarray technology they will be able to classify these types of cancers in a standardized non reader dependent manner based on the patterns of gene activity in the tumor cells
60966 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
60967 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
60968 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
60969 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes
60970 its like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room
60971 it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
60972 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
60973 now that we are learning how these drugs actually work
60974 we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects
60975 this research provides a better characterization of the variables at the cellular circuit and behavioral level that contribute to the persistent nature of addictive disorders
60976 the researchers were able to illuminate why drug related memories are so stable
60977 their persistence is highly refractory to new learning which makes our jobs that much tougher and reminds us that treatment must recognize and address the high propensity for relapse almost anywhere down the road
60978 these results indicate that the ltp induced by self administered cocaine is more persistent than that produced by natural rewards such as food and that the ltp is not just a result of exposure to cocaine but also is linked to the drugs effects and the animals learning to obtain the drug
60979 these are important distinctions that will help us better understand how addiction develops and why drugs can overshadow other natural rewards and become the mainstay of an addicted persons life
60980 i dont view the diplomacy as zero sum its got to be either this country or that country india and china and the united states will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs businesses throughout the region and theyll provide great opportunities for development of services and goods that people in our big markets want
60981 it provides great opportunities for capital flows that are foreign direct investment which is necessary for economic development
60982 collaboratively on strong strategic areas security areas one area will be theres a great opportunity for all of us to cooperate on the environment
60983 so i view the emergence of india and china as positives i think its going to be very important for the united states to stay engaged not only with the two nations if i were thailand id be asking what about us will you remember other nations and the answer is absolutely
60984 it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror
60985 you bet i wanted to make sure that we protected ourselves at home but thats the same sentiment other people have secondly our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
60986 our relations with south korea with japan and with china have never been better
60987 the cash amount you get may ultimately be very modest but whats really valuable is the ability to have access to that credit monitoring as well as your transunion credit score
60988 i have to be realistic and i dont see a big chance
60989 its pure tryout for me make a team or leave
60990 im no fool i know im not coming there to tear down the first line and sure im not coming to accept a marginal role as a fourth line player but i believe im still capable to play third line there
60991 as an artiste he was unique and inimitable he had a voice like a squeezed mango a stage manner that bordered on the absurd and a strange offbeat sense of humour that found expression in odd songs like field
60992 it doesnt help that lucass quasi horror sci fi premise appears to be stolen from some hokey 1950s b movie
60993 if it had been a mummy film it wouldnt have been that bad but it was supposed to be indiana jones
60994 im so sorry i said motherfucking whore in church oh god i said it again oh shit was that blasphemy oh fuck dammit
60995 the cracks are growing in the democratic unity dam and mccain may be on the verge of getting his act together sen barack obama needs to step off his holier than thou platform and get his designer shoes dirty he needs to let voters catch a glimpse of the regular guy who may actually lurk under his veneer of superiority from using a logo resembling a presidential seal at one speech earlier this year an obvious error and never seen again to addressing a crowd of 200 000 in berlin and meeting with heads of state before he has reason to obamas puerile self absorption may backfire on him and turn off the very voters he needs to turn on the white working class obama needs to humanize himself his campaign has done too good a job of apotheosizing him

60999 when asked how supportive if at all they would be of the introduction of a worldwide caliphate based on sharia fully 42 percent said they werent sure thats quite some uncertainty
61000 one in five wasnt sure whether islam is compatible with the western notion of democracy insecure young people can be swayed by extremists
61001 the question is how to stand up to the extremists
61002 i think we should abandon all discussion of what islam truly is
61003 took turns explaining why they liked mr obama and recalling the strange stares from other republicans
61004 it was sort of like a group therapy session we all wanted to make sure we werent a little crazy
61005 prefer card check because it means they know exactly how people are going to vote
61006 plans to spend some 150 million in this years election most of it to get barack obama and other democrats elected
61007 it is the fuel the opening for seiu to change our growth curve from 100 000 to a million or more workers a year
61008 that in itself burger argues makes the employee free choice act larger than any one single issue even more important than healthcare
61009 card check would make it easy for union organizers to intimidate workers into voting for the union by eliminating the secret ballot and then the seiu and other unions could force more cash from workers into the pockets of democrats now the seiu suddenly has 150 million from which theyve already committed at least 85 million specific to democratic candidates that money got squeezed out of the locals under duress in obvious violation of the spirit and letter of federal law the union knows how to protect itself and its interests and the lockstep nature of their support for democrats should awaken voters to the threat their policies comprise this is nothing more than a closed feedback loop for democrats and card check is the prize that will ensure its rapid growth
61010 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet

61012 the matter is more tighter upon a scholar than when one clenches his fist tightly even though the ignorant person is not excused because of his ignorance i e he will be held to account also however the scholar will receive a greater punishment if he abandons what he has knowledge of and doesnt act upon it
61013 and whosoever does an atoms weight of good he shall see it and whosoever does an atoms weight of evil he shall see it
61014 the millennium development goal of reducing by one half the proportion of people worldwide who live on less than 1 per day

61016 each economically advanced country will progressively increase its official development assistance to the developing countries and will exert its best efforts to reach a minimum net amount of 0 7 percent of its gross national product
61017 senator barack obama has grown up with the teaching of very angry militant white and black people the rev jeremiah wright louis farrakhan william ayers and rev michael pflegger
61018 we cannot say we are not affected by teachers who are militant and angry
61019 a proposition might be true in science and philosophy but false in religion
61020 the enunciation of a monosyllabic barnyard epithet is stretched hilariously over several minutes of music
61021 it takes the restraints off whatever meager amount of modesty the fcc requires and turns springers program into an even more turbulent cesspool of the most outrageous acts and vilest types of language
61022 the holiest concepts and figures in christian theology come in for the same level of scathing lampoon as do the more routine sorts of visitors to jerrys set an air of glib giggly impiety of an adolescent urge to see just how much it can get away with is more clearly evident here
61023 it may not be suitable for viewers without a strong grasp of judeo christian mythology
61024 oh well i guess im going to have to develop a sense of humor

61046 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase
61047 if this is the case the peak in yearly inflation that looks to have formed should be confirmed
61048 the monetary policy deliberations from the rba board next tuesday will be a tug of war between these recessionary indicators and the still high rate of inflation as shown in the inflation gauge for july
61049 i remain of the view that this demand component is unlikely to be removed without further tightening of monetary policy
61050 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
61051 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
61052 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
61053 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
61054 hes still in jamaica hospital he lost a lot of blood
61055 i cant understand why anyone would want to hurt them
61056 no mac and cheese today no mac a roni and cheese
61057 no love here look read here you can have chicken strips or a cheeseburger
61058 or a grilled cheese sandwich what would you like to eat
61059 they dont have that on thursday honey would you like chicken strips
61060 yes you are well on your way to earning a sticker what was your prize today
61061 yes you did all the way to school what did you do at school
61062 it important that we focus on stabilizing the financial system
61063 a very substantial change in the balance between growth and inflation
61064 essentially it will be the latest in a series of industry renationalisations and a reversal of what till now has been one of russias privatisation success stories
61065 i believe the shares of the state company will be managed jointly with private owners or they will be bought on market based conditions
61066 would be bad for the entire development of the market
61067 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
61068 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
61069 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
61070 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window
61071 the panic of last year is over its more orderly now but the financial stresses remain and there will be more difficulties to come
61072 the asset backed outstanding continues to creep a little lower
61073 no one is willing to touch the asset backed commercial paper because people are concerned about the intrinsic value of the underlying issues mortgage related securities
61074 weve taken key steps to position our asset portfolio for superior long term growth

61077 i think it is the beginning of the end of discrimination against gay couples
61078 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
61079 are doing terrible harm to marriage laws across the country
61080 our witnesses have led us to believe that the children and their mother were taken against their will
61081 i think we have a rule that says lobbyists cant be on the floor
61082 i bumped into a couple and they were looking for the exit they had that kind of dazed look in their eyes they werent sure which way to go
61083 they had missed the state house tour and they were a little disappointed so i brought them around and let them stand in the back of the chamber for a minute they were thrilled
61084 i was a bit surprised certainly former speakers and members enjoy a certain status but not all are lobbyists
61085 i think its important for us to have the appearance and reality of impropriety
61086 when i was speaker former speaker charles flaherty would have been registered as a lobbyist and any former speaker was entitled to come in
61087 theyd never do business on the floor you just dont do that
61088 theres nothing pending that they are working on that im interested in
61089 they have people who can write bigger checks i guess
61090 that doesnt play into it people get all sorts of contributions from people who may or may not like your stand on this
61091 i talked to the speaker and hes been very supportive hes not one of the people against this
61092 that was probably one of the worst nights of the year for the guys
61093 it would have been an entertaining game to watch but it wasnt that good being on the losing side
61094 its still fresh in our memories and its good motivation for the weekend
61095 everyone was ripping on defence and these tough wins are always the best ones
61096 in rugby league momentum is real important and if we can get a couple of wins together we can really ride that
61097 ive found with the warriors that once we get on a roll were hard to stop and thats what were looking to do again
61098 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
61099 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
61100 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
61101 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
61102 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
61103 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
61104 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
61105 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
61106 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
61107 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
61108 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
61109 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
61110 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
61111 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
61112 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
61113 they ask us about the economy they want to talk about our plans for keeping the country safe and thats the campaign were running
61114 in the first case a 39 year old female taking 50mg a day of vitamin b6 for three months developed a feeling of burning pain and
61115 she was also taking a multivitamin product containing vitamin b6 and therefore her total daily dose most likely exceeded the upper level of intake of 50mg a day recommended by national guidelines
61116 all patients should be advised of the risks associated with excessive doses of vitamins
61117 any kind of undisclosed paid placement spells trouble for consumers the media and the marketing industry

61128 everyone has talked up the toulon crowd and i cant wait to run out there and be a part of it
61129 they find you a place to live and give you a car straight away when you get here when the season starts they will put me into french school as well
61130 i think if i could have picked one dream club to come to when i obviously parted way with the force it would have been toulon
61131 i think its an attractive option for the top australian players that are earning big money in australia but they could earn a lot more over here without the salary cap put on them
61132 and its an attractive place i suppose for fringe australian players
61133 theres 14 teams in france and only four in australia so theres a lot more opportunity over here to get a start and play in a premier competition whereas the opportunities in australia may be a little more limited
61134 every player that is australian always has a dream of playing for the wallabies and i have not closed that door and hopefully the aru hasnt closed that door on me either
61135 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump

61137 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
61138 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 per cent or 30 per cent or 18 per cent
61139 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit

61141 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunologic approach to exploit this window of opportunity
61142 the good news was the surprisingly nice t cell response patients had to the flu vaccination even relatively soon after completing chemotherapy
61143 that shows that the general idea of using immunotherapy following chemotherapy to prevent recurrence is not a flawed one chemotherapy depleted the immune system but we could restore it
61144 was not very immunogenic we have a long way to go to optimizing this vaccine
61145 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
61146 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
61147 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
61148 our impact measure more accurately gauges what is going on in the classroom which is the way schools really should be evaluated if were trying to determine their effectiveness
61149 we cant evaluate schools assuming that they all serve similar kinds of children
61150 if we evaluate schools that way things change quite a bit as far as which ones we would identify as failing
61151 it suggests that many schools serving disadvantaged kids are doing a good job with children who face a lot of challenges
61152 these schools may be serving children from advantaged backgrounds who do well on achievement tests but the learning rate for their students isnt dramatically faster when they are in school versus when they are not in other words these schools are not having much positive impact
61153 we are not pressuring the schools that need to be pressured
61154 when you shift the focus from achievement to impact there are still schools that do very well and some that do poorly
61155 but they are not necessarily where you think they are there are high impact schools in every kind of neighborhood serving every kind of child the same is true of low impact schools
61156 if theres a school that rates high in educational impact but low on achievement maybe the school should have a summer program with those same teachers who are having such a positive impact
61157 thats certainly more appropriate than saying something must be wrong with this school because of the low achievement scores
61158 rather than use those six tests for low quality information lets redistribute them differently to get quality information about the schools
61159 we would have the same number of tests but information that is substantially more useful

61205 to the point where now a dozen years or so later its very hard to find a protester without a camera and the police are very aware of that
61206 i think police officers always have to keep in the back of their mind that anything they do anytime they are out on patrol is subject to being videotaped
61207 i think it is a step forward it is kind of a trite saying but a picture is worth a 1000 words
61208 i was told by the das office on several occasions that this was the complete unedited tape
61209 im certain there are people out there who were arrested
61210 who are still being prosecuted in this case who are absolutely innocent who dont have the video tape to prove it
61211 this generation of protesters tend to be much more restrained than their parents or grandparents maybe in part because they too want to look better on video tape

61292 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
61293 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
61294 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
61295 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
61296 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
61297 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
61298 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
61299 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
61300 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
61301 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
61302 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
61303 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
61304 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
61305 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
61306 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
61307 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
61308 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
61309 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
61310 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
61311 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
61312 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
61313 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
61314 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
61315 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
61316 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
61317 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
61318 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
61319 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
61320 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
61321 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
61322 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
61323 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
61324 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
61325 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
61326 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
61327 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
61328 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
61329 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
61330 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
61331 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
61332 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
61333 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
61334 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
61335 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
61336 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
61337 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
61338 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
61339 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
61340 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
61341 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
61342 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
61343 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
61344 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
61345 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
61346 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
61347 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
61348 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
61349 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
61350 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
61351 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
61352 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
61353 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
61354 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
61355 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
61356 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
61357 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
61358 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
61359 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
61360 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
61361 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
61362 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
61363 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
61364 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
61365 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
61366 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
61367 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
61368 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
61369 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
61370 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
61371 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
61372 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
61373 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
61374 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
61375 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
61376 who are open to doing something on the production side
61377 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
61378 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
61379 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

61386 saya dengan fatimah pergi menghadap rasulullah saw kami dapati beliau sedang menangis lalu kami bertanya kepadanya apakah yang menyebabkan ayahanda menangis ya rasulullah
61387 pada malam aku diisrak hingga ke langit di sana aku melihat perempuan dalam keadaan amat dahsyat dengan sebab itu aku menangis mengenangkan azab yang diterima mereka
61388 aku lihat ada perempuan digantung rambutnya otak kepalanya menggelegak aku lihat perempuan digantung lidahnya tangannya diikat ke belakang dan timah cair di curah ke dalam halkumnya tekak
61389 aku lihat perempuan yang digantung kedua kakinya terikat tangannya diikat ke ubun ubunnya disuakan ular dan kala aku lihat perempuan yang memakan dagingnya sendiri di bawahnya dinyalakan api neraka aku lihat perempuan mukanya hitam dan memakan tali perutnya sendiri
61390 aku lihat perempuan yang telinga pekak dan matanya buta diisikan ke dalam peti yang diperbuat daripada api neraka otaknya keluar daripada lubang hidung badan bau busuk kerana penyakit kusta dan sopak gt start pix2 gt gt end pix2 gt
61391 aku lihat perempuan yang kepalanya seperti babi badannya seperti himar berbagai kesengsaraan dihadapinya aku lihat perempuan yang rupanya seperti anjing kala dan ular masuk ke kemaluannya mulut dan pelepasnya punggung malaikat memukulnya dengan corong api neraka
61392 ayahanda yang dikasihi beritakanlah kepada anakanda apakah kesalahan yang dilakukan oleh perempuan itu
61393 fatimah adapun perempuan tergantung rambutnya itu adalah perempuan yang tidak menutup rambut daripada bukan muhrimnya perempuan tergantung lidahnya ialah perempuan yang menggunakan lidahnya untuk memaki dan menyakiti hati suaminya
61394 perempuan yang digantung susunya adalah perempuan yang menyusukan anak orang lain tanpa suaminya perempuan kedua kakinya tergantung itu ialah perempuan yang keluar dari rumahnya tanpa izin suaminya gt start pix3 gt gt end pix3 gt
61395 perempuan tidak mahu mandi daripada suci haid nan nifas ialah perempuan yang memakan badannya sendiri juga kerana ia berhias untuk lelaki bukan suaminya dan suka mengumpat orang
61396 perempuan yang memotong badannya sendiri dengan gunting api neraka kerana ia memperkenalkan dirinya kepada orang asing bersolek dan berhias supaya kecantikannya dilihat lelaki lain
61397 perempuan diikat kedua kakinya dan tangannya ke atas ubun ubunnya disuakan ular dan kala kepadanya kerana ia boleh sembahyang tetapi tidak mengerjakannya dan tidak mandi janabah
61398 perempuan kepalanya seperti babi dan badannya seperti himar ialah ahli pengumpat dan pendusta perempuan rupanya seperti anjing ialah perempuan yang suka membuat fitnah dan membenci suaminya
61399 perempuan menyakit hati suami dengan lidahnya pada hari kiamat nanti allah jadikan lidahnya sepanjang 70 hasta kemudian diikat di belakang tengkoknya
61400 perempuan menggunakan lidah untuk menyakiti hati suaminya ia akan dilaknat dan kemurkaan allah
61401 aku berdiri di atas syurga kebanyakan yang masuk ke dalamnya adalah golongan miskin dan orang kaya tertahan di luar pintu syurga kerana dihisab selain daripada itu ahli neraka diperintahkan masuk ke dalam neraka dan aku berdiri di atas pintu neraka ku lihat kebanyakan yang masuk ke dalam neraka adalah perempuan
61402 aku lihat api neraka tidak pernah aku melihatnya seperti hari ini kerana ada pemandangan yang dahsyat di dalamnya aku saksikan kebanyakan ahli neraka adalah perempuan

61428 i am interested in investigating the relationship between interactive online writing by which i mean two way written communication and more traditional composition genres such as the essay or the story so for example if students discuss their views on a literary or political topic in an online forum does that result in more effective independent free standing writing on the same topic by the same students do you ever ask students to write about something independently after they have discussed it online with others if so do you notice improvements in quality compared to what you might find if they had those pre writing discussions face to face
61429 a bridge between speaking and writing that promotes audience awareness and facilitates substantive interactive idea development
61430 do we ever do things and then are done or is everything a work in progress

61536 it has become clear to me that after the orchestrated politically inspired media event staged a few weeks ago that this campaign will ultimately be focused not on issues but on one unflattering photograph
61537 though i am innocent of these accusations against me i believe my continued presence in this state senate race will be a distraction
61538 have nothing to do with bonusgate they have nothing to do with bribery corruption misappropriation
61539 if you look at when these charges came down there is no reason at all why these charges could not have been deferred until after the election and allow the people to make their choice
61540 from the beginning of this campaign i have said that we need someone from outside the tired democratic political machine that supported mike veon and hand picked sean ramaley all that yesterdays announcement does is give that same set of back room political bosses the ability to change the name of their hand picked candidate and thats not the kind of change we need
61541 any time you have a tumult in a district it gives the opposition an opportunity for a pickup
61542 but how great an opportunity this is for republicans remains to be seen the republican situation is clearly better now than it was when sean ramaley was in the race and was not under indictment
61543 if you are elder vogel you would rather be running against an indicted sean ramaley than against a replacement democrat
61544 if he has to defend himself against such serious charges he wouldnt be able to represent the people in his district with the energy and time they deserve
61545 on who replaces him and how that person is chosen
61546 if the county committee chooses someone by a secretive process one without participation by ordinary democrats that creates its own problems
61547 there are some outstanding individuals who have expressed interest in running for the senate seat
61548 i believe the eventual democratic nominee will win in november
61549 just have them washed and hang them in the closet
61550 you cant be serious lady these are not at all befitting
61551 im afraid im a little overwhelmed after four months of relative peace
61552 well very peaceful interspersed with the murder bits which werent quite so peaceful
61553 no fever but you do look flushed perhaps you ought to retire for the evening
61554 people worry now you know theyve gotten you back what 3 times now after sudden departures they know that streak cant last
61555 i have told my children many times that if they dont take care of their things not to come crying when they lose them
61556 we are not like the youth of the past we are much more activist
61557 we do not just want to chafe under the policies of others we intend to make policy

61559 other skinheads are also vying for office under the pri banner we do not hide our beliefs and we make up for having little resources by throwing our hearts into our campaign
61560 the mere fact that we are able to field candidates is a triumph we are fighting to win for our homeland and our movement but also for nationalism around the world this is our contribution
61561 but my dear sweet child why would you want me to dont you want to be beautiful

61567 i have no idea what is going on i am lost get it im lost watching lost i have no idea what is happening they should call this show im lost instead of just lost what the hell is going on i dont know and still i am watching it
61568 we have one wish it is to make the beijing olympic games a global sports gathering a success
61569 the beijing olympic games belongs to the chinese people and more importantly to people across the world
61570 i dont think that politicizing the games will do anything to advance the issues it goes against the shared aspirations of people from around the world
61571 focus more on the environment and controlling pollution we want to pay more attention to improving peoples lives
61572 if you make plans be sure not to tell god
61573 if you ask a protestant to have dinner with you next thursday they will look at their calendar see that its free and tell you something like sure i should be availiable
61574 who knows what will happen between now and then only god knows his plans for us
61575 im sorry i havent gotten back to you im still waiting to find out if mom can get off of work im sorry you have to take care of our yard and our cat still i hope i dont get you into trouble for not having the paperwork filled out saying id be gone this long
61576 a lot of people dont realize how complicated what we do is they see a band at the football game on friday night and if we do it well it looks easy but its not easy and it takes a lot of work and preparations
61577 given the seriousness of the issues youd think we could have a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i mean i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this election is about is that what is worthy of the american people
61578 alice sudah mengangkat telepon dari punggung kursi didepannya sebelum pesawat berhenti menanjak sengaja memunggungi pramugari yang menatapnya tidak setuju
61579 do i ever imagine myself wanting to see this person naked or have him see me naked
61580 but i can honestly say a woman has never done that too me
61581 at this point we are still open to the gold coast being added to the schedule
61582 weve given the organisers down there two date options and hope to hear back from them in the near future
61583 we will continue to talk to the irl about the handling of the dates so at this stage i am not even going to get into what the dates could have been would have been or maybe possibly will be
61584 the ioc would like to stress that no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into
61585 i hope that there will be no restrictions thats our view weve been getting mixed messages on this
61586 kevan gospers felt it necessary to come out and apologise he clearly at some stage has been under the impression and you showed me the bit of paper saying there would be restrictions he didnt know that hes apologised
61587 others in the ioc say there are no restrictions so well see im finding it a little confusing
61588 we can get better access in a place called the mpc which is where accredited journalists like myself are working
61589 we can access websites such as amnesty and bbc china which were blocked before
61590 however we have also tested outside this mpc building and i would say that those websites anyone outside the venue would have great trouble getting through still today and falungong you can not get onto any of those websites anywhere in china
61591 ive got a very high regard for those on the executive board and kevin is probably a bit damaged at the moment
61592 god the master the holy of israel has this solemn counsel
61593 the fundamental fact of existence is that this trust in god this faith is the firm foundation under everything that makes life worth living
61594 it should open up the marketplace to a broader spectrum of companies
61595 it took us awhile to really get the standard to where we thought it was ready for the public because there are already a large number of very complicated interactions between ad players video content and video ads
61596 it really enables further standardization through the back end versus the sales product end
61597 this is really a back end efficiency initiative which will enable more sales
61598 theres the standard procedure for everything and then theres the romney way
61599 is mostly fast and very flexible so you can accommodate damn near everything

61603 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
61604 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
61605 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
61606 i have a great deal of baseless confidence in my own abilities to get a job done i own and understand tools i can do it
61607 hes probably trained harder and done more running than hes ever done
61608 its not about feeling sorry for him and who knows what could happen

61610 at the end of the day boz is a great character to have around
61611 im not in a position to tell the mariners what they should or shouldnt do but id like to see him in the game to be honest
61612 we were told yesterday our yellow cards in this competition carry over to the season proper
61613 weve got six guys i think on yellow and should one of those pick another one then weve got a problem and if a lot of them pick up another weve got a real problem
61614 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point
61615 youve got to do whats right for the team i guess its the right move for the team hopefully it is
61616 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point
61617 youve got to do whats right for the team i guess its the right move for the team hopefully it is
61618 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
61619 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
61620 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
61621 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
61622 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
61623 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
61624 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
61625 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
61626 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
61627 i took out two canadians maybe the people will start to hate me now
61628 in those two matches the crowd was obviously against me
61629 i dont think it revolves around whether he wins or loses this week i dont think the celebration is about just this game its about his whole career and well definitely acknowledge that
61630 i didnt read into what sam said yesterday as anything other than what he said
61631 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think that you need to take him on face value
61632 he may say silly things from time to time but i dont think he lies and i dont think hes that silly to go down that track again
61633 what was i we thinking this feature is just a mesmerizing black hole that makes the user feel no better then he she felt like before making the request
61634 ive seen what may be the best futuristic anthology series since the glory days of the twilight zone and the outer limits its called masters of science fiction
61635 what makes you think anyone is interested in what you have to say
61636 why burden people with the imperfect analogies spilling from your tiny mind spare me and whats with all these stories you guys are all the time telling
61637 25 down and 25 a month and these commandments are yours
61638 theres no point in getting in someones face on the show
61639 we try to keep it pretty informal guests usually drive in and they might come in wearing summer shorts or whatever its casual
61640 but if you turn around and make it uncomfortable for them to be there what incentive do they have to ever come back you cant just start ripping into them and obviously thats a lot harder to do anyway when someone is just sitting across from you
61641 but thats not to say we back away from controversy on the show weve had plenty of that over the five years i got into it pretty good with quin snyder one time and of course the stadium debate was pretty hot
61642 you want to be informative and have some fun and make them want to come back
61643 thats how weve gotten bill self to come in or gary pinkel to come in or even carl peterson to come in back when the show started
61644 when we started this thing five years ago they told us if we could get 1 0 rating thatd be good
61645 and there are times depending on the subject when it spikes much higher
61646 we wanted to start the show at 6 30 but weve got the simpsons then and obviously that does well and starting the show at 7 is tough because you go right up against live sporting events but weve hung in there
61647 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
61648 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
61649 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
61650 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
61651 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
61652 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
61653 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
61654 four in a row is not that bad i think by the time the tour championship is over that will be a lot of weeks in a row during that week ill be looking forward to the end of it all
61655 it comes at a perfect time the ryder cup does now being that its in the middle of the fedex cup season and everybody is at their sharpest
61656 everybody is playing hard to finish the year strong playing their best i think it showed during the presidents cup last year that our performance increased and i think itll do the same for the ryder cup
61657 i dont want to joke around about michelle wie shes got great talent but i hope she satisfies herself or whoever is in need of satisfaction from her playing out there the lpga tour offers a lot of competitiveness and shes obviously had her struggles i just hope that she can be allowed to just blossom into the great player that she can be

61663 the delegation made an impact in all categories from performing arts to the literary arts category ms mitchell said as pagopago wraps up the 10th festival of pacific arts
61664 it can very much be applied to a lot of modern day situations political or otherwise
61665 the four fundraisers we had went very well and were still getting contributions sent in the mail
61666 were going to have a lot left over to give to the recreation commission
61667 at one point it was an old rock and stone quarry
61668 the stone used in the foundations a lot of the buildings in indiana rest upon came from that quarry
61669 at first it was why dont we do a show this summer
61670 if i can do it here in indiana why not
61671 very low budget very minimalistic with minimal sound and design
61672 the community response has been really positive and people are really excited about what were doing

61689 the only thing hes jealous of is that i could play in the nhl and he couldnt
61690 hes an underachieving wannabe in terms of success in the nhl
61691 he won a stanley cup great ive won six stanley cups you want to count rings who cares its just a little pathetic that he carries on

61708 what we do know about barack obamas agenda is that he favors higher taxes supports abortion believes the federal government should be bigger and has embraced a foreign policy that would make jane fonda proud we also know he was rated by national journal as the most liberal senator because of his voting record according to their ranking even bernie sanders vermonts socialist senator isnt as liberal as barack obama no kidding
61709 that is where it started to go bad were playing good so hopefully that is where it starts to go great
61710 were back to the way we need to be playing
61711 getting hits making plays making pitches and winning when we lost we were playing bad so the losses felt heavy we seem to be more focused on the next game when the game is over win or lose its about trying to go out and win that next game i think that has a lot to do with attitude
61712 i just think it was probably one of those things where he had that talk because of how we were playing
61713 i think slumps only last so long so i think everybody pulled out of it so if you want to say it was due to the talk or if you want to say it was due to the prolonged slumps coming to an end either way
61714 you definitely can have too many meetings but i felt like at that time it was needed of course we come out and go 5 1 thats good if we go 10 1 and lose a couple believe me ill have another meeting i dont know if that has anything to do with it or not
61715 the role of the cavalry is to add colour dash and daring to what would otherwise be a mindless shitfight amongst grunts
61716 the spear slides into your guts slamming through the armour and burying itself in the tree trunk
61717 okay roaring in pain i dice roll slit my eyes and counter attack thrusting with my battered broadsword
61718 the sword rips into his chest sticking forth a foot proud of his back
61719 in every real man a child is hidden that wants to play

61725 the sound of it is much more like how we are when we play live were really happy with the result
61726 the goal now is to go through the year doing all the tours that we need to everything that has happened for the band has been so fast and so unpredictable that we try to keep our expectations low and not really exceed anything
61727 when we started touring we had to adapt all those songs
61728 it became much more rock all the songs from the first album sound more like the second album when we play them live so for us it was very natural to have the change of sound and do something more rock because thats how we are as a live band it was a natural change of moods for us
61729 we wanted to release it before the northern hemisphere summer
61730 we wanted it out in april or may but the label said july if we got it to them by april so there was no pressure on us all the pressure came from us
61731 it was the first time we went back to brazil to our own place and our families and stayed there for more than a month
61732 its really nice its like a fresh start for us
61733 having a new set up for the band makes us more excited to go back on tour
61734 the bad guys are not the ones actively finding vulnerabilities theyve shifted their business to standing on the shoulders of the security research community
61735 they dont have to do the hard work anymore their job is packaging whats been provided to them
61736 looks like an animal ate her left thigh ass cheek for breakfast
61737 what is this protected space that they are entitled to that the rest of us are not entitled to
61738 paris hiltons out of town things are quiet lindsay lohans got a new girlfriend thats keeping things quiet and evidently britney spears has gone straight now in terms of cleaning her act up so basically paparazzi are losing interest
61739 i am not ashamed of what i do everybody benefits from the paparazzi retail hotels tourism
61740 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
61741 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something
61742 for a sunscreen to be as effective as possible it should really protect against both uvb and uva rays
61743 what many people may not realise is that if they just have uvb protection they are less likely to burn but they have no protection against the harmful and ageing effects of uva rays
61744 many people look for an spf in their sunscreen thinking that this offers them full protection against uv damage in fact the spf only shows protection against uvb which is the type of uv that causes sunburn and skin cancer
61745 its uva that causes sun induced skin ageing and also contributes towards skin cancer but the spf does not show protection against uva you need to look for specific uva filters indicated in the uk by stars or a circular uva symbol
61746 id rather come to this lake than any of the other ones so im glad that theres a beach again where i can bring him
61747 the waters gone up a lot it had been down for so many years so its nice to be able to bring them out to play in the sand and get in the water there
61748 it was kind of dirty and stuff just a bunch of grass
61749 oh its really fun im so happy that theres sand here again
61750 im sure once everybody hears about the beach theyll be running out
61751 caused the state police to serve the governors and their own non governmental interests in a manner that compromised the state police
61752 senior spitzer administration officials did more than seek to generate a negative news story about the governors opponent

61754 approximately 35 percent of the population smokes and an estimated 200 000 deaths per year in indonesia are caused by tobacco related illness
61755 an estimated 78 percent of current indonesian smokers started before the age of 19
61756 i apologise for any misleading advertising initially associated with the show i am an unyielding advocate for the well being of children around the world and do not condone or endorse smoking i look forward to bringing my music and message to my wonderful fans in jakarta
61757 whether tobacco sponsorship of music events leads to youth smoking is a matter of serious debate
61758 having considered the facts in this specific instance we have decided to withdraw all branding associated with this concert
61759 how not to communicate with your partner in the bedroom
61760 delmer were having sex i dont want to talk about current events
61761 dude get out dont tell me youre into the european lowlands too
61762 we sit down together decide what needs to be done in cash what in checks
61763 we wanted to learn to communicate about our finances better
61764 thats one way you can recession proof yourself if you have a thousand dollars in the bank youre not going to worry if you have a flat tire
61765 even with gas prices rising were still a little prepared for that because we budget a hundred dollars and we can bump it up 20 dollars here or there but we still have that available to us because we know where our finances are at
61766 just the amount of worry has gone down immensely worrying about money worrying about whether or not were going to make a rent check have food get to work on amount of gas
61767 i think control is a big thing we are in control of our finances
61768 since all the votes have been cast before the meeting all thats really left is the theater
61769 i want to hold this board and management team accountable for the last year

61772 since all the votes have been cast before the meeting all thats really left is the theater
61773 i want to hold this board and management team accountable for the last year
61774 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
61775 i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship

61778 no peikoff does not deny a role to these other things
61779 theyre not getting restful sleep at night so they are having trouble behaving during the day
61780 im in a bad mood i dont want to be in a good mood no signing hymns

61785 several military officials acknowledged that no military unit would accept him
61786 miller said he spent three days on a remote marine base editing his photos which he then showed to the company e marines when they said they could not identify the dead marines he believed he was within embed rules which forbid showing identifiable soldiers killed in action before their families have been notified according to records mr miller provided he posted his photos on his web site the night of june 30 three days after the families had been notified
61787 i was with the 5th marines at hue for two weeks they took about 70 dead i photographed the dead and wounded without any restrictions they would not stand for it today they treat you in these embeds like a dog on a leash
61788 sf is a city with one of the best urban nature mix to me youre right in the middle of downtown and still youre surrounded by a breathtaking nature i cherish this duality a lot
61789 a city lover who feels intimately linked to the natural environment that inspires her
61790 feminine shapes meet sober colors for a sophisticated yet low key look
61791 i am deeply sorry i really look at myself as a person who has high integrity and high character
61792 to have these errors in judgment is not my character im sorry to put my family my friends and the seahawks through this
61793 but i cant go out to dinner or to the mall or anything like that
61794 its been tough one of the toughest things ive ever had to go through
61795 theres a perception out there i have a problem theres a perception out there that i have two duis theres a perception out there that there is this wild guy driving around seattle drunk
61796 but i have no one to blame but myself for that
61797 pretty much the writing is on that wall that its going to be that way its kind of like three strikes and youre out
61798 i really dont but like i said you never know i wanted to get professionals to see
61799 the revised order directs the intelligence community to produce timely accurate and insightful intelligence with special emphasis on the threats posed by international terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction
61800 todays actions will help create a more effective intelligence community capable of providing the president and his advisers with information necessary to defend our national and homeland security
61801 the executive order maintains and strengthens existing protections for americans civil liberties and privacy rights
61802 it is no longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multimission platform and then limit its use to tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats
61803 the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps
61804 the administration knows that a powerpoint briefing to staff and notifying the committee after leaking details of an executive order to the media does not constitute briefing the congressional intelligence committees as they have claimed
61805 given the impact that this order will have on americas intelligence community and this committees responsibility to oversee intelligence activities this cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
61806 after seven years of a go it alone presidency perhaps i should expect nothing more from this white house
61807 the administration has been briefing congressional oversight committees for the past two and half weeks on this executive order

61820 i am confident that when we do move the motion we will have the numbers you see the reason why they are making all these accusations against me is precisely because they know their days are numbered
61821 we have the numbers we have the support they want to stop me before we throw them out
61822 instead of addressing pressing economic problems like soaring inflation the government is trying to divert public attention with this filthy sodomy charade
61823 our ministers waste their time in political intrigue instead of trying to help make the country more competitive
61824 i am innocent and i am confident that i will clear my name
61825 pas leaders have assured me that they have no desire of leaving the pakatan and joining the barisan or merging with umno

61836 i sent a message to the spaniards no and to the venezuelan banker no
61837 now the government wants to buy the bank wants to recover it because its called the bank of venezuela to put it at the service of venezuela
61838 so now i am telling them i am interested in buying we are going to nationalize the banco de venezuela

61852 it did its best to keep above 94 us cents but it looks like it just gave way to selling pressure this morning
61853 the real danger for the rba as far as they are concerned is that they dont want to step in too quickly and start cutting rates when there is still inflationary pressures to some extent in the market
61854 they want to be very much certain that a rate cut is warranted

61856 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
61857 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
61858 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
61859 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
61860 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
61861 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

61938 its a good thing to maintain and conserve the resource
61939 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
61940 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
61941 i am honored and humbled that i would be honored for anything i would do
61942 were going out for grants to fund a full time person to research the issue

61960 kami akan menasionalisasi bank of venezuela saya minta grupo santander untuk datang dan memulai perundingan ujar chavez ketika menyampaikan pidato di televisi dan radio di caracas kamis waktu setempat atau jumat wib
61961 mereka ingin menjual bank itu kepada bankir venezuela dan sebagai kepala negara saya katakan tidak jual bank itu ke pemerintah kepada negara kami akan menyehatkan bank of venezuela kami sangat perlu bank dengan besaran seperti itu
61962 tentu saja akan ada berita utama di media spanyol seorang hugo chavez mungkin dituding dapat membatalkan hubungan diplomatik yang aru saja diperbaiki
61963 peristiwa politik di venezuela menunjukkan risiko yang meningkat pemerintah venezuela dapat menasionalisasi atau dengan cara lain campur tangan dalam operasi anak perusahaan kami di venezuela
61964 waktu penggalian pertama saya dibayar rp 150 000 untuk yang kedua dibayar rp 50 000 ya saya tidak tahu apakah akan ditambah lagi uangnya atau tidak

61967 kami tidak menemukan adanya tanda tanda gangguan psikotik kejiwaan artinya ryan memiliki daya nilai realitas sense of morality yang baik atau normal ia tidak berkepribadian ganda atau tidak mengalami kegilaan sesaat saat melakukan perbuatannya
61968 ini hal yang wajar tetapi kami sudah mengantisipasinya karena terlihat jelas dalam tes dan wawancara psikiatri kami bahwa ryan normal
61969 kesensitifannya itu dilampiaskannya dalam perilaku impulsif agresif seperti melempar memukul dan membanting
61970 stok untuk tiga bulan saja tidak cukup karena tidak aman kami mengarah di atas tiga bulan dan kalau bisa satu tahun seperti china

61973 tidak layak jika upaya kontrol wartawan terhadap kinerja publik direspons dengan tindakan kekerasan sebagaimana yang dilakukan lurah itu gubernur harus mengambil langkah atas masalah ini
61974 kami meminta polisi memberikan perlakuan yang sama kepada semua orang ketika ada wartawan melakukan penganiayaan wartawan itu ditahan di ruang tahanan dan hanya bisa dibesuk pada jam besuk kami meminta lurah loka juga diperlakukan sama ditahan tanpa keistimewaan
61975 itu budaya kekerasan jika wartawan saja dipukul lalu bagaimana perlakuan lurah kepada warganya apakah orang seperti itu pantas menjadi pejabat publik
61976 dengan atau tanpa laporan dari korban polisi harus menangani kasus itu karena itu adalah delik biasa bukan delik aduan
61977 sebagai respon pertama langkah bupati bulukumba memberhentikan lurah loka sudah tepat kami belum mengklarifikasi langsung tetapi logikanya lurah itu dimutasi ke badan kepegawaian daerah dengan status non job
61978 harga berbagai barang baku seperti daging sapi susu dan telur terus naik sehingga sebagian masyarakat mengurangi pembelian

61993 how could a baby possibly commit any sins on purpose
61994 obviously it is a story that cries out for an investigation
61995 there are too many coincidences and too many close ties to people involved in the nagin administration
61996 something like that could cross the line into something more sinister or a potential criminal violation

62003 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
62004 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
62005 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
62006 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunologic approach to exploit this window of opportunity
62007 the good news was the surprisingly nice t cell response patients had to the flu vaccination even relatively soon after completing chemotherapy
62008 that shows that the general idea of using immunotherapy following chemotherapy to prevent recurrence is not a flawed one chemotherapy depleted the immune system but we could restore it
62009 was not very immunogenic we have a long way to go to optimizing this vaccine

62013 exxon like most of its peers is facing an uphill battle maintaining let alone growing its oil and gas production
62014 stock fell thursday not so much due to the earnings but rather because of the market and the fact that the entire oil sector traded down in response to the decline in crude prices
62015 we much prefer to see the acquisition of an in market biologic franchise that the company is already familiar with as compared to a series of smaller riskier assets
62016 because of the greater likelihood that person could become president
62017 given that there is so much that is unconventional about his background and personna
62018 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
62019 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bill
62020 because hes newer and perceptions of him might be more subject to change
62021 voters may see his choice as more of a test
62022 im going to want somebody with integrity im going to want somebody with independence who is willing to tell me where he thinks or she thinks im wrong and im going to want somebody who shares a vision of the country where we need to go that weve got to fundamentally change not only our policies but how our politics works how business is done in washington
62023 significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months

62025 mice are very good at running as far as they can
62026 when they get exhausted they just stop running they cant run any more
62027 cant exercise and this would give them some of the benefits
62028 people who exercise have lower levels of depression and higher bone density
62029 whether or not this pill would confer those benefits we dont know

62032 its very difficult to eat well when youre constantly on the road attending dinners lunches barbecues
62033 probably want someone who takes care of his health as an example of the kind of personal discipline necessary to do the job
62034 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president of the united states or mr universe
62035 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day
62036 is engaging in the same old negative politics of karl rove
62037 somebody get a f ing corn dog in his hand now
62038 anybody gone into a whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
62039 well ive had lunch today but im thinking maybe there is some pie
62040 on several occasions and is currently using nicorette gum with success
62041 the push to repair bridges and our countrys infrastructure has become a victim of the bad economy
62042 if we dont put money into our roads and bridges and infrastructure our economy will get even worse we wont be able to transport anything across this country
62043 that billion dollars is really just a down payment because we dont have a true handle of what the costs are going to be
62044 ignoring the problem is only going to make it worse
62045 if they want to solve the problem theyd best not wait around for washington
62046 he must experience similar pain his wife went through when he cut off her right leg from the knee the judge ruled
62047 caused the state police to serve the governors and their own non governmental interests in a manner that compromised the state police
62048 senior spitzer administration officials did more than seek to generate a negative news story about the governors opponent
62049 state police were enlisted in an effort to gather and publicize sensitive information about sen brunos travels
62050 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
62051 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
62052 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
62053 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
62054 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
62055 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
62056 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
62057 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
62058 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
62059 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
62060 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
62061 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
62062 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
62063 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
62064 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
62065 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
62066 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
62067 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
62068 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
62069 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
62070 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
62071 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
62072 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
62073 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
62074 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
62075 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
62076 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
62077 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
62078 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients

62084 molti libri sarebbero stati molto pi chiari se non avessero voluto essere cos chiari
62085 if this is real why are there so many paradoxes and seeming inconsistencies
62086 if this is just something people do why is it so damned powerful
62087 i aint no sir just a plain workin stiff like the rest of my crew
62088 ah i see i beg your pardon i only assumed because of your sword and the way you sat your horse i meant no
62089 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
62090 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
62091 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
62092 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
62093 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
62094 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
62095 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
62096 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
62097 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
62098 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
62099 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
62100 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
62101 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
62102 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
62103 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
62104 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
62105 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
62106 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
62107 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
62108 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
62109 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
62110 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
62111 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
62112 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
62113 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
62114 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
62115 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
62116 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
62117 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
62118 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
62119 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
62120 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
62121 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
62122 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
62123 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
62124 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
62125 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
62126 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
62127 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
62128 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
62129 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
62130 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
62131 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
62132 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
62133 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
62134 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
62135 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
62136 that is why my children are not playing outside unless i am with them
62137 the fact that he can come and go after being sentenced to 43 years i dont know how that makes any sense
62138 we want to make it as inconvenient for them as possible
62139 i dont like having to worry about my daughter being in the front yard playing
62140 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
62141 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
62142 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
62143 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
62144 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
62145 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
62146 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
62147 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
62148 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
62149 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
62150 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
62151 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
62152 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
62153 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
62154 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
62155 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
62156 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
62157 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
62158 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
62159 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark

62163 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
62164 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
62165 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
62166 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
62167 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
62168 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
62169 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
62170 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
62171 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
62172 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
62173 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
62174 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
62175 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
62176 in america you are not playing the race card when you acknowledge a very visible fact trollneequa commented on
62177 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
62178 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
62179 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
62180 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
62181 my business is my life and im ok with that
62182 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
62183 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
62184 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
62185 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
62186 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
62187 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
62188 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
62189 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
62190 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
62191 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
62192 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
62193 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
62194 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
62195 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
62196 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
62197 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
62198 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
62199 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
62200 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
62201 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
62202 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
62203 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
62204 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
62205 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
62206 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
62207 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
62208 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
62209 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
62210 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
62211 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
62212 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
62213 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
62214 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
62215 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
62216 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
62217 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
62218 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
62219 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
62220 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
62221 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
62222 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
62223 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
62224 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
62225 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
62226 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
62227 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
62228 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
62229 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
62230 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
62231 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
62232 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
62233 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
62234 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
62235 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
62236 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
62237 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
62238 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
62239 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
62240 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
62241 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
62242 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
62243 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
62244 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
62245 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
62246 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
62247 just because i want to feel a cock in my pussy doesnt mean i love men it means i love the feeling of having my cunt filled completely the way that only a cock can

62252 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
62253 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
62254 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
62255 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
62256 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
62257 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
62258 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes

62262 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy

62268 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
62269 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
62270 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
62271 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
62272 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
62273 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
62274 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
62275 if the vice president says its do able i believe
62276 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
62277 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
62278 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
62279 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
62280 climate change is the greatest environmental crisis that humanity has ever faced but it is not the only serious challenge confronting us there is a simultaneous source problem known as peak oil arising from the depletion of the fuels we are burning particularly petroleum the solution to both climate change and peak oil is to develop renewable sources of energy to use less energy to use energy differently and to make this shift as rapidly as possible
62281 al gores ambitious goal provides a national focus and call to action now whats needed is a clear sighted plan for achieving it one that recognizes the complex issues of energy depletion the vulnerability of the supply chain and the limits of technology we are taking up gores call and presenting a powerful framework to realize this vision a vision that would revitalize america and make it genuinely sustainable
62282 al gores generational challenge to repower america which places energy at the forefront of the national agenda should be the top issue debated by all candidates this fall
62283 energy touches almost every critical issue facing our country including the economy security and the environment gores courageous and rational plan to move to 100 renewable energy sources in 10 years has my full support our 10 point plan provides the stepping stones to achieve this target
62284 we thank al gore for articulating the most urgent action needed to safeguard americas environmental economic and societal future and that of the entire world our mission is to get society off of fossil fuels fast and we embrace the need to move to 100 renewable energy with this plan
62285 our dangerous overreliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises

62289 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
62290 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
62291 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
62292 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
62293 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
62294 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
62295 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
62296 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
62297 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
62298 hes got the emmy the oscar hes a nobel laureate why would he want to go back to that
62299 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
62300 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
62301 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
62302 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
62303 hey i just shot a drug smuggler in the ass after he attacked my partner
62304 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
62305 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
62306 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
62307 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
62308 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
62309 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
62310 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
62311 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
62312 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
62313 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
62314 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
62315 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
62316 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
62317 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
62318 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
62319 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
62320 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
62321 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
62322 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
62323 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
62324 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
62325 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
62326 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
62327 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
62328 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
62329 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
62330 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
62331 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
62332 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
62333 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
62334 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
62335 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
62336 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
62337 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
62338 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
62339 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
62340 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
62341 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
62342 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
62343 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
62344 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
62345 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
62346 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
62347 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
62348 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
62349 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
62350 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
62351 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
62352 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
62353 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
62354 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
62355 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
62356 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
62357 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
62358 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
62359 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
62360 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
62361 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
62362 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
62363 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
62364 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
62365 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
62366 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
62367 we understand that this research was conducted up to a year ago our own more recent research shows that young people are supportive of the games coming to london and want to be part of it
62368 weve undertaken a lot of activities in the past year aimed at young people in particular
62369 we took a road show to 27 cities all around the uk last year and over 50 000 youngsters tried a new sport at these roadshows we are taking a similar roadshow around london in the next few weeks
62370 they are not going to build all those stadiums in time it just isnt going to happen theyve already spent billions more than they should have
62371 thatll be really embarrassing if we run it but dont win it
62372 our education programme is being launched in september this will be a very important way of engaging young people
62373 i know its not you its me i replied how lame is that
62374 well lets keep in touch a phone call every so often
62375 to prevent anything we are going to check it with an mri and hope itll be fine and just a little bit sore
62376 toms hurting right now he might be ready he might not but i have to be ready no matter what happens
62377 i wouldnt be playing if i still couldnt do it
62378 all i was promised was the opportunity to compete and im still competing
62379 i have nothing but respect and admiration for john lynch i was sorry to see him leave
62380 i was learning a lot for him and he was a great veteran leader and i am going to miss him around here
62381 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
62382 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
62383 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
62384 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
62385 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
62386 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
62387 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
62388 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege
62389 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
62390 lo malo de los reportajes es que uno tiene que contestarle en el momento a un periodista todo lo que no supo contestarse a s mismo en toda la vida y encima pretenden que uno quede como inteligente
62391 por d nde hay que empujar este pa s para llevarlo adelante
62392 resulta que si uno no se apura a cambiar el mundo despu s es el mundo el que lo cambia a uno
62393 y claro el drama de ser presidente es que si uno se pone a resolver los problemas de estado no le queda tiempo para gobernar
62394 dicen que el hombre es un animal de costumbres m s bien de costumbre el hombre es un animal
62395 como siempre lo urgente no deja tiempo para lo importante
62396 why look look at what hitched a ride in the back of my truck i think it might be an alien
62397 well darling i dont know what it is it must be a mutant bug that hitched a ride with you from slidell who would have thought it wanted to come to the coast of mississipi maybe it was trying to get to the beach theres only one thing to do we better take this fellow to the public library theyll be able to tell us what it is
62398 miss jane ive got this mutant bug can you tell me what it is
62399 well i dont know but i know who might we need miss bethany
62400 well here she is bethany we have a strange bug we need to identify
62401 why thats a click beetle ive never seen one in real life im so glad you brought him in where in the world did you find him
62402 wow we thought he was a mutant bug from louisiana
62403 hes an eyed click beetle see those spots on his back see how they look like eyes they are there to make him look fierce and threatening to predators and hes called a click beetle because if he accidentally falls on his back he can pop himself over back on his feet he makes a clicking sound you see hes a click beetle he clicks thats what he does

62405 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
62406 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
62407 with the admissions process the more you know yourself and the career track youre heading on the better youll be at answering the application essay questions
62408 a self assessment tool will only provide results based on what you provide as input
62409 so it is imperative that you represent yourself as you are in order to find results that can be helpful
62410 its an animal study and its a relatively small sample
62411 its very interesting but putting genetic type research like this into context is quite difficult at the early stage it can offer up great potential but when you then go to humans and when you then go to trained humans the potential may not be there
62412 we understand that even the appearance of conflicts in cme is damaging and we are determined to take actions that are in the best interests of patients and physicians
62413 theres not only a perception of bias theres a reality
62414 were committed to finding a solution thats acceptable to all parties
62415 any ceo who comes to the board with a plan like that should immediately submit his resignation
62416 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
62417 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
62418 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
62419 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
62420 i really went after good horses with armbro plato we got beat by only a length in the hambletonian
62421 the big ones are the good ones he just caught my eye
62422 id rather drive a 2 5 shot than a 40 1
62423 but im still up every day at 5 30 in the morning working 18 hour days
62424 i saw it tangled there so i moved my horse a little bit closer and put my stick under it
62425 it was more important to see nobody hurt than winning the race
62426 everyone said she was bigger than midnight lute and hes a big dude
62427 so i got out my measuring stick and it turns out shes just over 17 hands about a half an inch taller than him maybe we can breed them and get a 19hands high horse
62428 i need to meet him hes a very funny guy
62429 wheres mighty quinn i kid my wife randi i married her only because mattys good friends with mighty
62430 wheres mighty quinn i want his prediction on how my jets will do this season
62431 may hailey be guided by her parents grandparents and godparents michael carr as she begins her new life mighty predicts a bright future for hailey from the wisdom her loved ones show new york jets making the playoffs this season mightys crystal ball says not this year sorry andrew
62432 theres no pressure again on us and were not worried about anything
62433 weve got two horses that are ready if something crazy happens again well have fun
62434 if not big brown will get his status back i guess i always said he was a top horse
62435 this is a tall order for any horse if big brown shows up and runs his a game
62436 its kind of hard for me to feel as confident as i was for the derby and his other races
62437 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to go out there and run his race
62438 hes in fantastic shape the best shape of his life hes very sharp but what i like is that hes very calm and composed when zab is like this no one can beat him
62439 but theres no way im losing to joshua clottey hes in a different level than me he hasnt been in with the type of guys ive been in with
62440 after his fight he went on television talking about how he wanted to fight me why would he do that when we see each other in the gym every single day i said if you want to fight me why dont we do it right now right here he backed down

62466 in my case i had lost a lot while i was over there and it just started the more you lose and the less they do for you the more you start to see how jacked up things really are
62467 and theres plenty they could do and they just they did nothing i lost a lot of money i lost my family while i was there you know pretty much and when i get back id lost so much it was like i needed to start over

62476 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech
62477 i was a freshman and i was in world history class and my class didnt go i guess they thought that ralph didnt fit with world history
62478 yeah but ive been interested in mr nader since then reading about him and i want to help him
62479 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people

62526 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
62527 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
62528 i fought in the first year of the iraq war and i lost a few friends along the way but i hate the war even before that why did i sign up well no one was talking about iraq when i signed i used to think it would be great to have bill clinton back in office but now i see i was wrong such a move would move america too much towards what she was never meant to be
62529 we are delighted to have reached this important point and are looking forward to seeing the cars in showrooms shortly
62530 are almost like department stores where some departments make money and some dont make money or lose money if you decide to take a profit and loss mentality for the whole system you focus on things that make money the whole market ethos has become so dominant that people dont really have another way of understanding what health care is all about and it causes all kinds of problems
62531 my generation worships the god of the universe and yours worships the god of process
62532 took the decision to disguise bury and hide all forensic links to that linked balcombe street to guildford and woolwich bombings
62533 a skillful and cunning plot to get the others off
62534 i served 15 years for a crime i did not commit
62535 for a woman with no political interest to be suddenly challenging the british government and british judiciary it must have been daunting at times but she quietly went about with great dignity telling people what had happened to me and my father and the others
62536 it will make no difference to us in dublin we are going on in dublin
62537 a drop in commodity prices eased market concerns over inflation pressures
62538 i think they should probably be a little less paranoid about parsing every word we say and a little more focused on actually addressing the challenges that americans expect the president of the united states to take on
62539 i consider this to be the most significant civil case in the history of the district
62540 if the results were not so tragic up crew members varying descriptions of their attempts to put out the fire would be somewhat comical
62541 this court must consider as many courts have the unique character of the land at issue
62542 much of the devastated areas involved old growth forests designated wilderness and trees that were hundreds of years old
62543 we believe that when this fire occurred our employees took reasonable precautions to put it out
62544 unfortunately we had a situation that was pretty much extraordinary and unanticipated and that caused the fire to flare up again
62545 made time to go to the gym but cancelled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
62546 there is legitimate mockery of a political campaign now and it isnt at obamas
62547 you know i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against
62548 with all the breathless coverage from abroad and with senator obama now addressing his speeches to the people of the world im starting to feel a little left out
62549 is to combat recreational drug use not to regulate a states medical practices
62550 when we went in for the last time i held her in my arms for the comfort of both of us until she had left
62551 i have still not really made peace with losing her so young
62552 i believe ill have three cats and a whole bunch of dogs waiting for me
62553 i believe we each can find answers to divine questions if we look deeply in our own hearts and ask for guidance there although our answers may differ from the answers others have found they are our own and they will comfort us
62554 and there is only one religious truth i can confidently assert that our relationships with our companion animals are both emotional and spiritual so they never really end wherever our bodies and souls go after death
62555 if god knows the fate of a sparrow what makes you think he wouldnt be concerned about our pets
62556 to some people they are our children who are you to say they do not have souls or a heaven to go to
62557 we really have no biblical grounds for an assurance that our pets will be resurrected along with us
62558 but the scriptures imply that heavens overwhelming treasure for us is the fellowship that we the followers of christ will have with our creator and savior
62559 but a lot of people have a hard time with that and i do too when i see a grieving pet owner i know god wants us to be totally happy in heaven and if our dog will help make us fully happy and if god can resurrect us im sure he could resurrect a dog too
62560 so indirectly if they want their pets they can have them with them
62561 for example he will charge an animal that has horns who took advantage of one that didnt have horns and that horned animal will be turned to dust after taking him to account for what the horned animal did
62562 lord please help me to become as great a person as my dog thinks i am
62563 judaism teaches that god reserves a blessed existence in the world to come for the truly virtuous
62564 its only fitting that such an existence includes the pet that inspired the greatness
62565 for myself paradise with my own mutt rescue the wonder dog is a perfect inducement to pursue virtue
62566 it doesnt matter if we have feet or wings or roots
62567 so yes there is an afterlife for animals we all are going home back to the creator and yes people will see their pets again the dog i had as a kid his spirit never left me he just moved into a different dimension
62568 yudhisthira was allowed to go to heaven but not his dog
62569 but he didnt want to enter heaven without his dog on yudhisthiras insistence both were allowed to enter heaven in eternal peace
62570 because of the souls inherent urge to be united with its source god souls in animals will ultimately evolve to the human plane once the soul is in a human body it is capable of union with god in eternal bliss but it may take many more reincarnations in human form to liberate the soul from the death rebirth cycle
62571 so our pets whom we love and take care of should be treated as manifestations of the divine
62572 the buddha talked about being present now rather than spending a lot of time worrying about whats out there
62573 ive had three cats that ive shared my life with and have made my life richer but i dont know if ill see them again

62579 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
62580 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
62581 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
62582 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
62583 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
62584 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company

62640 dan allah telah berjanji kepada orang orang yang beriman di antara kamu dan mengerjakan amal amal yang saleh bahwa dia sungguh sungguh akan menjadikan mereka berkuasa dimuka bumi sebagaimana dia telah menjadikan orang orang sebelum mereka berkuasa dan sungguh dia akan meneguhkan bagi mereka agama yang telah diridhai nya untuk mereka dan dia benar benar akan menukar keadaan mereka sesudah mereka dalam ketakutan menjadi aman sentausa mereka tetap menyembahku ku dengan tiada mempersekutukan sesuatu apapun dengan aku dan barangsiapa yang tetap kafir sesudah janji itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang fasik
62641 tidak ada yang namanya jihad pada zaman sekarang ini dan kamu tidak boleh keluar untuk pergi berjihad dan wajib bagimu untuk taat kepada pemerintah
62642 aku menasehatimu untuk tidak pergi berjihad karena sesungguhnya itu adalah sebuah fitnah
62643 dan perangilah mereka sampai tidak ada fitnah sehingga agama itu hanya untuk alloh jika mereka berhenti memerangi kalian maka tidak ada permusuhan kecuali kepada orang orang yang dzolim
62644 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
62645 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
62646 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
62647 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
62648 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants
62649 dan berpeganglah kamu semuanya kepada tali agama allah dan janganlah kamu bercerai berai dan ingatlah akan nikmat allah kepadamu ketika kamu dahulu masa jahiliyah bermusuh musuhan maka allah mempersatukan hatimu lalu menjadilah kamu karena nikmat allah orang orang yang bersaudara dan kamu telah berada di tepi jurang neraka lalu allah menyelamatkan kamu dari padanya demikianlah allah menerangkan ayat ayat nya kepadamu agar kamu mendapat petunjuk
62650 dan taatlah kepada allah dan rasul nya dan janganlah kamu berbantah bantahan yang menyebabkan kamu menjadi gentar dan hilang kekuatanmu dan bersabarlah sesungguhnya allah beserta orang orang yang sabar
62651 dan allah tidak menjadikannya mengirim bala bantuan itu melainkan sebagai kabar gembira dan agar hatimu menjadi tenteram karenanya dan kemenangan itu hanyalah dari sisi allah sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
62652 jika allah menolong kamu maka tak adalah orang yang dapat mengalahkan kamu jika allah membiarkan kamu tidak memberi pertolongan maka siapakah gerangan yang dapat menolong kamu selain dari allah sesudah itu karena itu hendaklah kepada allah saja orang orang mukmin bertawakkal
62653 dan perangilah mereka supaya jangan ada fitnah dan supaya agama itu semata mata untuk allah jika mereka berhenti dari kekafiran maka sesungguhnya allah maha melihat apa yang mereka kerjakan
62654 dan berapa banyaknya nabi yang berperang bersama sama mereka sejumlah besar dari pengikut nya yang bertakwa mereka tidak menjadi lemah karena bencana yang menimpa mereka di jalan allah dan tidak lesu dan tidak pula menyerah kepada musuh allah menyukai orang orang yang sabar
62655 saya ingin menenteramkan hati segenap rakyat kami di palestina khususnya bahwa kami insya allah akan meluaskan front jihad kami tidak akan mengakui batas batas wilayah yang ditetapkan sais beaco1 mungkin maksudnya pakta sykes picot juga tidak mengakui keabsahan penguasa siapapun yang menjalankan agenda kolonialisme
62656 kungkungan para ulama dan penguasa serta kungkungan kelompok kelompok islam yang manhajnya telah berubah menjadi mengakomodasi penguasa yang dzolim atau kelompok kelompok islam yang lain yang telah merubah manhaj gerakannya yang awalnya berargumen mengedepankan sikap hati hati tetapi ternyata semakin berubah menjadi kepengecutan sehingga mereka lebih memilih berebut kursi dalam pemilu ketimbang tegak berdiri untuk berjihad
62657 rakyat syria karena bumi syria bumi syam adalah bumi yang diberkati agar berjuang melakukan segala hal yang mereka bisa untuk menolong saudara mujahidin mereka di iraq

62669 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times

62671 damn it i told you to stop kicking my seat
62672 the results of our study suggest that treatment to eradicate h pylori reduces the risk of developing new gastric carcinoma in patients who have a history of such disease and are thus at risk for developing further gastric cancers we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
62673 yet worldwide gastric cancer kills more people and there is better evidence that h pylori eradication can prevent mortality than there is for colonoscopy screening preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
62674 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
62675 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
62676 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
62677 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
62678 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
62679 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
62680 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influence a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
62681 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
62682 we give the flu shot primarily to prevent elderly deaths
62683 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
62684 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia
62685 this study is a reminder that flu vaccines are not a panacea but they are valuable because they cut down on the incidence of influenza
62686 flu shots definitely cut down on the number of flu related deaths

62720 to spread cloud computing in japan it is very meaningful that ibm has launched the first cloud computing center in japan at this time ns solutions research center will actively use this center and advocate cloud computing
62721 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable game changing even life changing applications
62722 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
62723 to develop high skilled human resources in it field it is necessary to create latest it environment in education place
62724 kyushu university is very interested in cloud computing technology which can provide an on demand it environment to our students and teachers we have been working with ibm the pioneer of this field kyushu university will continue to take advantage of cloud computing technology more actively
62725 twenty years ago one half of all citizens in corpora met the standards for adequate physical fitness as then defined by the national advisory board on physical fitness today the board says that only one quarter of all citizens are adequately fit and suggests that spending too much time using computers may be the reason but since overall fitness levels are highest in regions of corpora where levels of computer ownership are also highest it is clear that using computers has not made citizens less physically fit instead as shown by this years unusually low expenditures on fitness related products and services the recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause and fitness levels will improve when the economy does

62746 i think there is now a tide running against labours centralized bureaucratic approach our vision of a post bureaucratic age accepts that there is a profound role for the state not in micro managing but in creating frameworks to allow problems to be addressed not in a way which increases demands on the taxpayer if we could lift people out of multiple deprivation crime drugs worklessness and family breakdown we would be able over time to significantly address the demands society places on the taxpayer
62747 weve had enough of inspections and all sorts of raids in general our law enforcement and state institutions should stop terrifying business
62748 this is a body blow to the global economy nonetheless theres no point crying over spilt milk what weve got to do now is dust ourselves off and get on with the task of where to next and i will be engaged in discussions with various international leaders in the days ahead about how we seek to find a further pathway forward i dont wish to hold out unnecessary hope on that question

62780 there are bills to pay and work to be done
62781 your head is in the clouds while your body is devoured by society
62782 though the billions of years that have gone by you think your little rock of a planet and its crude economics and war and politics are more important than the questions of the universe billions of stars undiscovered dimensions quarks and atoms true definitions of energy and matter and gravity and you come along and pull this boy to worry and toll about how to live on earth
62783 its on earth you get telescopes but before that you have to get an education and before that you have to get money and before that you have to get a job this boy is a man and must focus on the road not the sky now is not the time to worry yourself about how the universe began or will end as long as it exists you have time to get your shit together son and pay the fucking car insurance i came to be to make sure your long gazes out of the cityscape are over
62784 your existence is not welcome along with the rest of your viciousness that was over the boys head during his childhood on his parents

62789 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country

62844 excellent ill have to check the place out maybe ill see you there saturday
62845 sure mr mendoza well i do have to go back to my station
62846 now mrs davis that is no way to talk about your co workers
62847 good morning am here to see mr mcmillan about a will
62848 oh yes mr mendoza the solicitor has been expecting you he is in his office please follow me
62849 we are here to read the last will and testament of mr antonio miguel mendoza acosta
62850 and i leave as trustee of all my assets one mr
62851 mr mendoza please i must finish with the formal reading of the will before i can answer any questions
62852 so let me get this straight i have to baby sit my late fathers assets until
62853 i can assure you mr mendoza that your father made ample provisions for his surviving kin
62854 the estimated value of all the assets is 5 5 million
62855 and the trusts accounts are estimated a 120 000 each plus they are arranged to make their management as simple as possible that includes michaels monthly stipend for the next four years you as the sole trustee are free to make any necessary adjustments
62856 of course plus as president of your fathers company you would be receiving a substantial salary
62857 mr mcmillan this trustee business means i would have to move here run a business i know nothing about for the next four years or more and make sure he graduates from college i have a job an apartment a life back home a life 15 hours and a several thousand miles that way
62858 mr mendoza you do have some legal options but i would have to refer you to another solicitor if you wish to explore them
62859 very well their are other documents here that you have to verify and sign after that ill take care of the rest
62860 please dont talk about when jesus gets crucified that makes me nervous
62861 even though i really love you im gonna smile cuz i deserve to itll all get better in time

62868 the clothes are so beautiful they make you want to cry
62869 she can do it well sign her up and see how it goes but no make up the child does not need to wear make up or a hairpiece thats not debatable
62870 but i dont know if shell agree to those terms
62871 hey look at me i am todays girl and tomorrows woman i play with barbie dolls i wear a gown and a tiara and i can do more push ups than any boy in my class i get good grades coo at babies and can fling around dangerous looking weapons with grace
62872 get to work a manifesto for women of the world
62873 what theyre trying to do is make you scared of me he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
62874 it is written man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of god
62875 and jesus said come to the waters stand by my side i know you are thirsty you wont be denied i felt every tear drop when in darkness you cried and i strove to remind you that for those tears died i know most of the words but i am trying to find the whole song and possible music
62876 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
62877 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof

62885 welcome to the new school i hope you bring us laurels as you have to your old school

62887 listen please dont mind but i dont want to sit with you its just that today my friends absent today and shell be here tomorrow so could you please change your seat and tell the teacher you did it
62888 listen please find somewhere else to sit i like to sit alone

62908 go back to your asshole husband because hes probably going to be shipped out to iraq soon anyway and comeback dead
62909 what i meant was there have been many recent developments in my life of which you are only one which is to say that i am still not sure if i am like this
62910 rule number one he says you cant write about this
62911 my right thigh was in your hand i hovered waiting for your release
62912 when we had more time and bellies full enough with food we sang of love but it began with stones and sharpened sticks then sharpened sticks hardened in fire
62913 theyre still on alert because we have another big wind event coming in tomorrow
62914 the fire has burned to the point now where people can see the flames
62915 its still flaming up there but theyve been on it day and night
62916 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
62917 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
62918 typically we dont see wildland fires of this magnitude until much later in the season
62919 but with the dry fuel conditions that we have throughout the state we could see similar situations arise again until we get a significant amount of rain
62920 we very much want to hear from our constituents at this point before the plan is finalized
62921 so far our towns have always strongly supported our schools we want to keep it that way
62922 on mdi we are fortunate to have a locally supported school system that already exemplifies many of the collaborative administrative functions that the governor wanted to effect through reorganization
62923 this plan will allow area schools to continue to collaborate evolve and efficiently share administrative functions in order to maintain the educational qualities and opportunities that this region is proud of
62924 gracias por su responsabilidad pero no es una especie protegida ni en extinci n as que d jelo en el monte en libertad
62925 i feel ok but i still wish he was on the pirates
62926 hes a good hitter hes my favorite player and hes gone
62927 but its the third time that the team has had to rebuild i hope this time these guys in management know what theyre doing we need some good young talent to restock the minor league system
62928 and its good for bay he deserves to be with a good team like the red sox i hope he does really well
62929 he can cook for me hes a pretty good baby sitter he doesnt know all this yet though
62930 obviously this is a dream come true its something you dream about as kids and its something andy and i have been talking about for the last five years it will be pretty special having him on the same team
62931 i know hes my brother but i always thought he was a hell of a ballplayer it looks like were going to have a bunch of young players he should fit in great and be a huge help
62932 hes a dirt bag he loves to play hes a jason kendall type
62933 i have him as a 15 to 20 home run per season guy
62934 but he pulls the ball enough that his bat will probably play well in pnc park hes an average defender but he can definitely play right field in that park
62935 hes the enigma of the four coming to the pirates because of command
62936 i just dont know if he can throw enough strikes
62937 but with the depth we got in the whole package this is an exciting step as we move forward
62938 one of the things thats good about jose is his versatility
62939 when we have too many third basemen at the major league level who have a bright future then we have a challenge
62940 we have a lot of faith in the guys we have
62941 we had conversations that went right down to the wire obviously when you have that you feel like you have a chance
62942 i mean this is the damnedest thing ive ever seen as far as skin i cant explain it nobody here can explain it and it just hasnt gotten any better
62943 maybe with two laroches you can generate one decent season between them
62944 we must be willing to get rid of the life weve planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us
62945 many many people put many many hours into how it ended up too
62946 even though the groundwork had been laid a while ago
62947 im not sure there really is one guy that we target as the anchor of this trade
62948 andy laroche was one of the best prospects in all of baseball and were thrilled to get him
62949 i think they understand the direction were going in and some even appreciate it right now though its a shock jason bay above and beyond everything else is a great person hes what we hope all future pirates aspire to be a real model
62950 ive always been happy here but im just glad its over one way or the other
62951 i understand theres skepticism based on the history but i believe the fans will see very quickly that this isnt the same old story
62952 weve made trades here based on sound baseball judgment and building a championship caliber organization not for financial reasons and were confident people will see that
62953 we said no time and again and we were doing that right up until the final minute
62954 papa dont worry im alright be strong and dont give up the fight
62955 pull yourself up together papa im always at your side
62956 once we get our new system theyll probably go out in a power outage too
62957 whats the motive from the city to make my life miserable
62958 when my husband and i first got married we had no ornaments we had a bare tree
62959 hallmark keepsake ornament sales are extremely important to my business
62960 this years ornaments are really impressive and obviously these shoppers liked what they saw
62961 its something everybody wanted to see and now they can
62962 didnt do much for a few years but he spent his time planning a bigger one
62963 one of the last great moonshiners who loved these mountains he called gods country still one step ahead of the revenuers
62964 i told my wife were building the right way and building what we want or were not coming back
62965 looks like its going to fall over at any time
62966 if people feel they have to rebuild to 10 feet up and dont have money they wont return
62967 where am i going to be if the neighborhood doesnt come back
62968 it was one of the worst in my 25 years because of everything involved the church the kids the critically injured and because it came to knoxville
62969 as we got to the church officers were coming out with their shotguns
62970 he came running out and said its bad guys really bad
62971 the thing going through my mind was what was i going to see around the corner
62972 i could not believe it everybody got hit in the head
62973 thats a critical wound to the head so it was a worst case scenario
62974 they were keeping the wounded upright and keeping pressure on the wounds i have to brag on them
62975 towels blankets coats anything they could find to stop the bleeding
62976 they got coats and sweaters in the middle of the summer
62977 i remember looking at the shells and thinking thats good they havent been fired
62978 if there was one word for it it was surreal
62979 the gift of your professional skills made such a critical difference in restoring the facility and hopefully the spirits of those who view it as their church home
62980 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends
62981 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
62982 you have a lot of people who cant afford expensive clothes you see people getting teased because of that its sad
62983 you can still show your personality by who you are
62984 especially when its hot its nice to be able to wear shorts
62985 i kind of want to be more comfortable in the classroom
62986 but i still dont understand how merely changing the way you dress can improve test scores i think its a little absurd
62987 students to feel that they belong to something important and we also want them to be prepared for the expectations of todays workforce
62988 im generally not really crazy about dress codes but this is a very loose one
62989 i guess i dont really have a choice i think ill just have to deal with it
62990 i think ill have a choice of color dress shirts i can wear
62991 i just think like its a way of improving our school
62992 i think by next year everybody will be doing it theyll see that its doing a good thing for our school and they might try it
62993 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
62994 no u s corporation ever made that much in a quarter but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
62995 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
62996 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
62997 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
62998 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
62999 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
63000 i dont know if itll be horrible but i know that it takes as many chances as something like field of dreams did
63001 i dont like that feeling per se im uncomfortable with it
63002 you just write that we have more action in our movie than the mummy
63003 there are more special effects dazzling special effects and the stunt work
63004 weve got an election coming down to a single vote
63005 we know thats a little bit unrealistic its mathematical but lets say unrealistic but everything we do after that starts to ring true and we find the humor in that
63006 thats just as important to us as the next laugh
63007 the last thing we needed was just a cute girl because a lot of scenes depended on her
63008 ive been in some ive made some but i like to bounce around
63009 if i just kept coming over here and seeing you and just kept telling you the old dances with wolves story the old whatever you might still like me but its like you dont want to spend time with me ive always felt that as a filmmaker its my obligation to bring different offerings might not be the best career move but it is a relationship that you have with an audience an obligation that i think you have
63010 one thing was just a talk i had with myself just staring up at the clouds that i wasnt good in university and that i needed to break away from the conventions of going to business school
63011 that was pretty nice for my parents to be able to say hes in business school and it was even nice for me to say yeah im in university im taking marketing i knew it was just kind of a ruse
63012 i knew that i had to trust myself enough to go with where i felt comfortable it was huge when i decided that thats what i would call myself an actor and thats what i would become it was a large moment
63013 we intend to and will plead not guilty to this charge and this office will fully and completely defend this case in order to ensure that justice flows like a mighty stream
63014 he and others in the sheriffs office have really been active in the dossett case and we offered the assistance of our office and our criminal investigator
63015 they pulled together the case that was submitted to the grand jury
63016 we expect a second autopsy would prove evidence that would be of some significance to the prosecution
63017 not sufficient to be the cause of death i would lean towards this cause of death being related to intoxication of morphine
63018 the presence of many people of so many different faith traditions and ideas being here to support our church means so much to us
63019 i think all of us felt like this took a piece out of ourselves
63020 to celebrate what cant be taken away from us by an irrational act
63021 you cant allow your fear or your confusion or your sorrow or your anger you cant allow any of these emotions to keep you separated from what is central to your living however you express it religiously
63022 were not so much unlike any other town this size
63023 were just trying to provide the essentials were a pretty quiet safe community when we see an opportunity to improve i think were pretty aggressively doing that
63024 hes a great community person so many people in the community are involved in things thats how you get things done
63025 weve done a lot of work on the airport in the last three or four years thanks to a lot of federal money i think im right when i say its the only paved runway in calhoun county were trying to improve the life of our own residents and our neighbors whatever we can do were going to give it a shot
63026 theyll bring 30 to 40 golf carts and go zipping back and forth between the old library and the new library teens will run up and down the steps with the books he hopes to get it done in four hours
63027 he never called in sick he would always be at the office in a suit and tie and he always taught us any job worth doing is worth doing right
63028 you put your full effort in and you dont walk away until its finished
63029 if you were going down and no one let you out you were history and the other guy just couldnt do it
63030 woe be unto you if you werent there on time
63031 you dont appreciate it at the time but now as adults with our own families you see the value of a strong family upbringing like that
63032 he was so very proud of his home and family and his friends and neighbors
63033 i look back and i just feel i cheated myself
63034 sometimes i didnt prepare the way i should people have always told me zab if you were just in a little better shape nobody could beat you i cheated myself a lot i didnt get myself in great shape like i should have been but now im here
63035 i see a lot of great fighters in this game that only got one opportunity and you worry about that i know theres not too many more opportunities so the one that ive got im going to capitalize off of it
63036 i call myself lucky lefty no matter what happens i somehow come back and find myself at the top again
63037 not to downplay joshua clottey but i feel like ive been in the ring with more of the elite fighters more of the best fighters
63038 hes a methodical fighter very one dimensional hes never fought somebody like me
63039 i wait and wait for this fight and finally i have it
63040 its my time to be a champion its not zabs time anymore
63041 that means we have some score to settle he tried to fight me on the streets its not about the title its about zab i want to fight him if zab beats me i will retire for one year no way he beats me

63047 hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in the isles afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock for the lord hath redeemed jacob and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he
63048 i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth
63049 this is partly explained by efforts made by cst to improve contact with smaller jewish communities beyond the main urban centres and goes some way to explaining the overall rise in incidents
63050 by knowing the scale of the problem we can deploy strategies to combat anti semitism from our streets and our campuses
63051 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
63052 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come
63053 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
63054 many have married moroccans and produced offspring thanks to their wealth they have secured a reputation in the communities they settled in but they constitute an army of moles a danger to us and to europe across the mediterranean
63055 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
63056 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come
63057 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
63058 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
63059 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
63060 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
63061 for these reasons arguably the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
63062 i think irregular warfare is very important particularly in contrast to preparing solely for conventional warfighting but it shouldnt be our only focus
63063 we ought to be training our forces and procuring our weapons systems to reflect the reality
63064 the chiefs were provided an opportunity to review the document by the secretary
63065 they were grateful and they did provide comment and are comfortable with the final product
63066 assume greater responsibility as a stakeholder in the international system commensurate with its growing economic military and soft power
63067 u s predominance in traditional warfare is not unchallenged but is sustainable for the medium term given current trends
63068 we will continue to focus our investments on building capabilities to address these other challenges while examining areas where we can assume greater risk
63069 it is overstating the case to say that extremist islamic ideology is going to define the next 20 or 30 years
63070 i think thats not helpful because youre sacrificing everything for this one fight but its a transition document either mccain or obama could walk in the door and live with that document and do all kinds of things
63071 so whats it going to take to bring this prick down
63072 theres a trillion dollars in saudi money invested in our stock market another trillion in our banks

63075 on the one hand alzheimers disease is a complex pathologic process and that is daunting
63076 but now we are beginning to segregate out different therapeutic targets and develop drugs that have an impact on each target so in combination they may handle the disease better than any single approach
63077 we established the association but when it comes to explaining it we can only speculate at this state
63078 if you are looking for interventions to prevent alzheimers one way may be to identify people who have been divorced or widowed and who havent adapted or gotten back into the social circle and give them support with the aim of giving them new structure and social networks in their lives
63079 but he adds this elementary vision of targeting must be weighted against some of the costs

63087 this was to signal the dismissal and interment of the physical body and the joyous event of the release of the soul to heaven relatives friends and acquaintances would become the second line and dance with wild abandon
63088 this may be coincidence but you colin at forexspirit simon from simon super trader and myself all had good febuarys sic but those same people had a pretty bad march except simon but he did say in his blog that he had some very rough trades is this a coincidence or was the market acting really different
63089 youd have to go back to the era of the great depression
63090 last month we said economic growth was moderating we have a motion before us to replace moderating with slowing the motion has been seconded the floor is open for discussion
63091 because weve never used restrained and ive always wanted to use restrained
63092 er thats fine thank you but i dont care for restrained the markets might worry they might think that we think that something is restraining growth that needs to be un restrained
63093 mr chairman forgive my impertinance but is un restrained a proper word
63094 well i believe so im almost certain i recall we used it during the barings crisis of 94
63095 jesus god what are we doing here cant we just say the economy is okay and if things change well let you know
63096 please settle down the discussion will continue while the word un restrained is being looked up
63097 i think that depends on whether up is being used as an adverb or preposition
63098 frankly i thought the proper usage was up which it is being looked
63099 please we will have none of that now where were we
63100 how about phil was up looking your big hairy nose
63101 ladies and gentlemen i will not have this type of disrespectful behavior the secretary will strike the previous remarks from the record
63102 starting where starting with how about phil was up looking or starting with big hairy nose
63103 hmmm where to begin the striking of the records that is a conundrum i recall a similar situation during the asian crisis of 98 do i have a motion
63104 i move we all stick needles in our eyes because that would be more fun than im having right now
63105 i second the previous motion that we start with how about phil was up looking
63106 mr chairman before we discuss that motion id like to report that the term un restrained is not proper english
63107 mr chairman i note the presence of a dead body on the table would you like a motion to remove the body
63108 first let me express my shock and surprise he pauses and clears his throat amid solemn murmurs and nods around the table that the term un restrained is not proper english
63109 i have decided to convert my dedicated short funds into long only partnerships april fools day
63110 wow they know its a joke but the computer models dont have a sense of humor so once the 1 up trigger kicked in the machines started buying

63113 if we do the work that we can do in this country the work that we will do when john kerry is president people like christopher reeve will get up out of that wheelchair and walk again
63114 yes breakthrough research often takes time but thats never been a reason to not even try until george bush

63119 when i was being ali g and borat i was in character sometimes 14 hours a day and i came to love them so admitting i am never going to play them again is quite a sad thing
63120 it is like saying goodbye to a loved one it is hard and the problem with success although its fantastic is that every new person who sees the borat movie is one less person i get with borat again so its a kind of self defeating form really
63121 15 16 year old guys lying on the floor with their bibles in their hands all dead on the floor
63122 we look around right now and see the snow on the trees standing out here and say

63126 the australian side has an excellent team of staff and im excited about the opportunity work with them and gain experience at international level
63127 i think one of my advantages is that i have had a range of backgrounds and i will try to draw on that as much as i can because theres going to be a lot they can teach me but hopefully i can also help them out as well
63128 of the 8 000 oregonians on this email list only 40 have made contributions toward our efforts totaling 4 385 00 that is not enough
63129 a lot of people have been saying i live here
63130 theyre probably thinking hes going to turn it over and start asking for money or something
63131 its the right time for bollywood with so many avenues and doors opening up on a global scale the possibilities are immense im just keeping my fingers crossed
63132 what happened lea and she says i wore a swimming suit that showed the navel and women cant show their navel in the swimming pool and so i was pulled out of class and so i asked navel well what can the men wear and she says anything they want to
63133 thats when it was so clear to me that sexism existed and many of us accepted it but did nothing about it
63134 its a law that has affected everybody in the country
63135 i run a statewide project and we go out to all the communities throughout all the islands and let grandparents know that this health insurance is available for their grandchildren and we really like to make sure that they call 2 1 1 or go to covering kids com to get the information
63136 well the good news is for the qwest program which is funded by the state and federal governments that the grandparents can apply for the grandchildren who are living in their homes they do not count the grandparents income
63137 and the other good news is you dont have to report an absent parent so sometimes the grandparents may be worried about that and so what were trying to do is get this information out to grandparents raising grandchildren so they have peace of mind
63138 it haunts me everyday because i can hear masumi calling for us to take her home her cry is incessant in my ear i will have to live out my life with this never ending cry of my daughters voice ringing in my ears
63139 even after all of this we still bow humbly to you to beg and plead to show us someway that we can return her remains to her hometown in japan
63140 the prosecutor is right about a lot of things what i did was heartless what i did was wrong but i did not kill masumi watanabe
63141 not murder but something inappropriate and then not tell the truth about it and then expect to get away with that but since he didnt kill anybody then life in prison isnt the right answer
63142 we will bring all of the things we werent able to bring before the jury to the parole board including his abuse of his wife including former acts of sexual advances on the woman who had been at the exotic club or the drink club whatever you want to call it
63143 the court finds that you present extreme danger to our community based on the execution of your crime based on the deliberate cold disposal of ms watanabe it really warrants a prolonged stay in prison
63144 it only explains a tiny fraction of why people might develop schizophrenia
63145 copy number variations or cnvs to more illnesses including autism and mental retardation
63146 i have done a bit of the stunts like jumping out of a limo shooting a pistol they have made me very tough in movie
63147 i have been with many sardars but the way a paggadi turban suits akshay kumar it doesnt suit anyone else i have not seen anyone else looking so good he looks very powerful and very very handsome
63148 im very disappointed an race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it
63149 its not even quite august yet and hes still ahead in the polls but barack obama has played the race card charles johnson
63150 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama the editorial board
63151 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
63152 mccain is playing the desperation card again and again the washington post
63153 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
63154 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
63155 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
63156 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
63157 w ithout habeas corpus in the united states today what we now have is a fourth reich somebody in a position of power the president the attorney general the head of homeland security can simply point a figure at you and designate you as an undesirable and hence an enemy combatant and they can grab you and imprison you and you dont even get a day in court much less a lawyer
63158 today almost every thinking person agrees that the united states is off on the wrong path

63162 our impact measure more accurately gauges what is going on in the classroom which is the way schools really should be evaluated if were trying to determine their effectiveness
63163 we cant evaluate schools assuming that they all serve similar kinds of children
63164 if we evaluate schools that way things change quite a bit as far as which ones we would identify as failing
63165 it suggests that many schools serving disadvantaged kids are doing a good job with children who face a lot of challenges
63166 these schools may be serving children from advantaged backgrounds who do well on achievement tests but the learning rate for their students isnt dramatically faster when they are in school versus when they are not in other words these schools are not having much positive impact
63167 we are not pressuring the schools that need to be pressured
63168 when you shift the focus from achievement to impact there are still schools that do very well and some that do poorly
63169 but they are not necessarily where you think they are there are high impact schools in every kind of neighborhood serving every kind of child the same is true of low impact schools
63170 if theres a school that rates high in educational impact but low on achievement maybe the school should have a summer program with those same teachers who are having such a positive impact
63171 thats certainly more appropriate than saying something must be wrong with this school because of the low achievement scores
63172 rather than use those six tests for low quality information lets redistribute them differently to get quality information about the schools
63173 we would have the same number of tests but information that is substantially more useful

63183 we apologize for this unfortunate situation and hope to work with people who bought tickets to the experience thinking they were for the obama event
63184 as it developed though we had no control over the change in days the tickets to the american presidential experience were available
63185 i have got to be there i am just trying to figure some way to get into the convention
63186 this is a good series for us both teams are at the same point where we are starting a new generation of players and are trying to work things out and see how our young guys will fit
63187 some of our younger guys came in today and looked ok at times and did some really great things benoit raymond passed really well and all four of our left sides contributed a lot of rotation like that is difficult but they kept their focus and executed some very good things
63188 we have had a lot of time to practice but have not had a lot of competition they guys have been hungry for that
63189 foreigners must respect chinese laws while in china and must not harm chinas national security or damage social order

63200 pissing off a large group of people even if you have the legal right to do so can often be a disastrous business move
63201 it is kind of difficult to discern what we have
63202 we are still going to work it as a kidnapping based on the information that we have
63203 everyone in this government is responsible for a string of failures we must let the people decide through new elections

63206 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate i will then prove my innocence
63207 the olmert who spoke yesterday from the garden of his compound in jerusalem was a crushed and battered man tainted by allegations lacking public trust or a sympathetic ear
63208 she didnt feel good about that she didnt feel good about him at all and this is what her mom told me
63209 when i saw her the last time she just didnt seem happy i dont know from the marriage or what but she just didnt seem really happy
63210 shes busy shes stepped out shes just not around i thought maybe she had left him and movrd to another city state something
63211 you were a person in a position of trust you were a person these girls turned to for instruction on how to succeed at riding
63212 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
63213 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
63214 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
63215 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
63216 there was no way he could have given me a red card for what i did if hed heard what i said he wouldnt have given it
63217 i wasnt trying to instigate anything i was just trying to say that hey this is ridiculous
63218 atlante keeper federico vilar came out and whacked me because he thought i hit one of his players
63219 the red card created more of a problem than there really was
63220 ive never been hit in the face and not retaliated before
63221 i was thinking about the final but i have mixed emotions
63222 the reality is that were not being compensated to be dealing with this
63223 this whole tournament has not been handled properly to have last night go like it did its just a microcosm of the whole situation
63224 we love defense as a team because we have a lot of guys who can get at it defensively cause some havoc and make a lot of plays
63225 he passed the ball well played great defense ran the lanes he played like lebron james
63226 youre not going to win every time thats just the nature of the beast
63227 and then the next time the player comes in maybe you win it back from them
63228 we are extremely focused on the challenges and issues before us
63229 in the short run high rollers can really put a dent in a casinos bottom line
63230 they kind of walk a fine line because they have to protect obviously their assets
63231 but on the other hand some casinos that cater to high rollers they keep raising the stakes to get the high rollers to come to their properties
63232 in the long term the math is on their side and theyre going to win but it certainly makes the investors and the stockholders queasy
63233 city manager alan bergren and i talked to the governor this week and we wanted to see how we could continue the program
63234 the governor not only supports this kind of partnership but the whole concept of the program itself working with the city will enable the funding to continue through this next budget cycle
63235 we expect that these results will be viewed negatively today
63236 we are demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders
63237 the way we think about the buyback its a distribution we view it as nothing more than a distribution
63238 whats good for exxon mobil is not good for america
63239 the proposed sale of entrepreneur media was only contemplated because of a very good offer not because the company is in any trouble in fact we are debt free and have been for the past 5 years
63240 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer vertically integrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins

63243 all the kinds of things you take for granted from an online media perspective you cant do on tv you want to change out an ad it takes days you want to change weighting or targeting and switch to a different type of audience its pretty difficult it was my one foray into the tv space after spending 10 years online and i felt ready to come back
63244 its certainly a challenging advertising market for some right now my assumption is that many papers are largely selling to local advertisers what quadrantone offers is the ability to take their local content these audience and the ability to localize the message for national advertisers and national advertisers get this type of media youre talking about people checking out local news i dont have the data in front of me but the engagement on these sites is substantially higher that will make a difference
63245 were going to continue with what i consider to be an intelligent affiliate strategy the best thing i can do with my time and as we expand the business is bring on more national advertisers were going to double the size of the ad sales team within the next four to six weeks keep in mind this is a company thats only 140 days old so theres only five or six sales people 10 altogether including support the way it works is the better i do for my affiliates the more affiliates ill ultimately have

63255 the happiest guy in america right now is terry francona
63256 some people are mulling over decisions some people have changed their minds some people have gone on vacation and the negotiations go on we hoped to have wrapped it up by now but life isnt always quite so neat
63257 for marketing and selling advertising for whatever programming is finalized
63258 our objective is not to beat eei in the ratings or even match them
63259 we never will we strive to be a credible alternative to the sports programming on eei and other stations and we dont have to be their size to do that
63260 the good thing about hiring people who have been put through a public flogging is that theyre virtually scandal proof
63261 the ones that havent been caught yet keep on spinning and are ticking time bombs
63262 jessamy had to make the case to espn national that going more local and removing midday national programming is the best option
63263 its a testimony to jessamys persuasiveness and this is a good thing for the station
63264 theyre throwing a lot of money into that and i dont think were in a position to do that now
63265 look at the radio ad market everywhere look at entercom
63266 we can demonstrate trendlines in which we have more than doubled our ratings in prime categories over the last year the categories advertisers care most about
63267 jims approach to sports was just the same as news
63268 if it was compelling and interesting hed run with it
63269 heres an example john dennis and i went to logan airport one night at 3 a m to try and get wade boggs returning from a road trip who shows up but jim thistle boggs said he wouldnt talk but told john to see him at the ballpark later that day
63270 john is sitting in the dugout waiting and boggs comes up the runway and sits down next to him and says okay go
63271 he was the undisputed king of news managers in this town

63274 durante mis a os aqu he visto como han maltratado a otros grandes jugadores cuando ya no lo quer an para tratar de enga ar a los fan ticos
63275 los medias rojas hicieron lo mismo con tipos como nomar garciaparra y pedro mart nez y ahora hacen lo mismo conmigo su meta es pintarme como el malo de la pel cula
63276 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
63277 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
63278 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the us 100 to us 110 range
63279 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher

63292 every time we play a game we want them double 0s
63293 were coming high into the game but were still focused on the game taking every game one game at a time
63294 our main focus is to play football in jacksonville and come out with a win
63295 usually everybody is trying to stand out and be a superstar but we preached all week family family family you cant do nothing by yourself but together we can achieve
63296 i have a feeling this right here could turn our season around
63297 this whole defense whether it works or whether it fails is dependent on what our linebackers do
63298 if were going to lose were going to lose through the air but not on the ground
63299 theyre only about 35 or 45 minutes away from us every time we play them its exciting
63300 its our third season so its about time we go ahead and get that win

63304 you will be outdone by fools who run google searches and import other peoples work and simpletons who really dont understand the creativity it takes to do what you have done
63305 teen gridders dont have many options as far as programs go they dont have the money to invest in maya
63306 senator obama says that he wants energy independence but hes opposed to new drilling at home
63307 yesterday he suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so so i believe that every energy source needs to be part of the solution we need to develop new alternative energies like wind solar tide biofuels but we also need to develop more existing energies like nuclear power and clean coal
63308 if mccain picked a woman it would certainly get the attention and perhaps votes of some democrats and a number of independents who supported hillary clinton
63309 shes got it all and is a remarkable leader who brings a number of good qualities to the table
63310 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace
63311 were in a recession it is going to widen its going to deepen
63312 data showing an extra one million employees have been relegated from full time to part time jobs over the last year a pattern that has disguised the true level of weakness in the labour market
63313 we have discovered that theres a switch that can be flipped to unlock a little bit more potential out of your muscles and give yourself a chance to be in a much more healthy state
63314 youve fooled the muscle into thinking you just did a huge amount of exercise when all you really did is activate the enzyme thats normally activated due to exercise
63315 we realized that as soon as the paper comes out theres a good chance that athletes will start experimenting

63318 if the cities elected our president if urban voters determined the outcome john f kerry would have won by a landslide

63320 our proposal includes modernization of our aging water systems significant investment in healing and safeguarding the sacramento san joaquin river delta and other important ecosystems increased water storage in reservoirs and underground aquifers improved conveyance and a strong focus on conservation programs
63321 a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale
63322 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
63323 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
63324 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
63325 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
63326 forgive me gentlemen if i dont understand what in the name of mordor your malfunction happens to be
63327 you did put up a mighty fight worthy of umbar castamir would be proud for he could shatter law with law like a sledgehammer
63328 if we get to the ruined city many will die those soldiers are not the farmer militias most in the city have fought ive faced the crescent marked ones before and they fight to the death and do it fiercely
63329 there will always be another rat now onward things to do people to damage

63333 there will always be another rat now onward things to do people to damage
63334 i know you hate it when i give you advice but i need to tell you how i really feel are you sure you arent making a mistake cant you find a nice 20 house somewhere around here you dont need to try to keep up with the jones what happens if p dawg suddenly kicks the bucket i cant help but feel a sense of foreboding and doom over this choice you have made
63335 tony tony come around what is lost must be found
63336 we read about it in the paper and it sounded like the perfect thing for us
63337 ah you read about the mother of a 3 year old who wants to get fit again and the couple hoping to offset the result of two years in grad school
63338 and did you also read how their going to follow the three through the program and how they want to find a family to follow as well
63339 but this will be healthier than going out for ice cream
63340 teachers often work with low scoring students and make improvements in the achievement of individual students but despite considerable gains those students may not make it all the way to proficient
63341 it is very frustrating to make significant growth but not have that acknowledged
63342 i would say putting a growth model in place gives teachers incentive
63343 it the proficiency only model doesnt account for where kids start out
63344 its not bad for students to have their school identified as in need of improvement if its indeed in need of improvement
63345 it is very frustrating to make significant growth but not have that acknowledged
63346 i would say putting a growth model in place gives teachers incentive
63347 it a growth model really gives hope for kids who are really far behind
63348 the pangloss index how states game the no child left behind act
63349 everything is weighted toward reducing the number of non ayp schools instead of identifying students who need help
63350 its not bad for students to have their school identified as in need of improvement if its indeed in need of improvement
63351 the use of subgroup data has brought attention to subgroups in a way we never had before
63352 it sounds really good but it makes it really difficult for a school to make ayp
63353 the law of the land when we were in school was equal access to education today its equal achievement on the same test on the same day thats really not realistic
63354 we decided against it because the flexibility it offered was very minor
63355 a report from the u s department of education recommends that detroit public schools be required to pay back at least 1 3 million in misused funds

63371 we say you get a months worth of meals in two hours
63372 we do all the grocery shopping all the slicing and dicing and chopping
63373 the issues that will be addressed at this meeting ultimately affect our community
63374 on a day that were trying to proclaim the month or week as childrens mental health awareness week is a day or time when were trying to get rid of a childrens mental health program that seems to be effective

63376 el objetivo es identificar el tratamiento que necesitan en lugar de estar experimentando directamente con el paciente estaremos experimentando en el laboratorio para empezar el tratamiento lo m s afinado posible
63377 nada m s en medicamentos antirretrovirales se destinan 850 millones de pesos al a o de un total de 18 000 millones de pesos en medicamentos que compra la instituci n en general de manera adicional hay que sumar todo el gasto que tiene que ver en materia hospitalaria y la atenci n preventiva la cual se est fortaleciendo
63378 es una enfermedad que tiene componentes fundamentalmente pol ticos y sociales relacionados con el estigma y la discriminaci n los prejuicios y la falta de informaci n y educaci n respecto de lo que son pr cticas sexuales protegidas
63379 hemos logrado acuerdos y avances en c mo involucrarlos y c mo darles un papel de transmisores de los mensajes y la informaci n que fluya de los pacientes hacia los m dicos y enfermeras y al rev s
63380 tenemos que verlo no s lo en nuestras pr cticas cl nicas sino tambi n en t rminos de trato al paciente del combate a los prejuicios de la no estigmatizaci n a nuestros derechohabientes
63381 yo dir a que es una de las grandes conclusiones que vamos a tener de esta conferencia internacional y m xico est avanzando en esa direcci n
63382 ongoing uncertainties and supply side shocks continue to pose risks on inflation the central bank will consider a further measured rate hike when needed so as to prevent the potential second round effects of such risk factors
63383 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
63384 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
63385 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
63386 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
63387 hes still in jamaica hospital he lost a lot of blood
63388 i cant understand why anyone would want to hurt them
63389 the needs of the many outweight the needs of the few
63390 these infrequent storms we get might green up the grass but they dont put enough water in the ground to keep the river flowing like it normally does
63391 so coming together will allow us to perform more efficiently and effectively for our customers
63392 as our permanent corporate home in new england it demonstrates our commitment to being a significant regional employer and a good corporate citizen
63393 ive seen how they mistreated other great players when they didnt want them the red sox did the same with nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez
63394 its nice to come home and be greeted by someone i didnt want to give the cat back
63395 it was just a blur of polka dots and tiger stripes and all sorts of colors they were running around an playing
63396 she was probably the ugliest one there but i picked her up and even after i put her back down she wouldnt leave me so i figured she picked me and that was that
63397 well nimbus that means cloud is just a giant fluff ball cloud
63398 and nora is a feisty 1930s kind of gal i never knew how special they could become to me
63399 but you dont want them to reproduced and when theyre unfixed they have a lot of bad behaviors
63400 we try to start the spay neuter program in the spring before mating season
63401 but we never get them all by summer weve used up our funding spaying and neutering a ton of cats but we also have a lot of new kittens we need to fix
63402 people usually think of dogs as dependant on humans and that cats are independent
63403 buying a dog is given much more thought also when people move lots of times they take their dogs with them but leave their cats to fend for themselves which adds to the feral cat problem
63404 my friends have given me all sorts of grief since i adopted them
63405 but the charles river alley cats made it all so easy to do ive told everyone i know about them
63406 its still early but certainly we are pleased by where were at at this stage of the campaign
63407 if we had more money to give them we would
63408 we want to keep marriage defined as one man and one woman throughout the nation
63409 i think we have to spend more than they do
63410 i dont think we have to spend a lot more but i think we have spend more than they do and were completely capable of raising that
63411 its been too long and has taken a toll on my family
63412 what devaney did is definitely disrespectful and harmful to me
63413 im glad she could admit that what she did is wrong
63414 i dont know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened
63415 because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others
63416 and it began the anbar awakening i mean thats just a matter of history
63417 i would say mccain is three quarters right in this debate
63418 the sectarian cleansing of baghdad has been albeit tragic one of the key elements to the drop in sectarian violence in the capital its a very simple concept baghdad has been divided segregated into sunni and shia enclaves the days of mixed neighborhoods are gone if anyone is telling you that the cleansing of baghdad has not contributed to the fall in violence then they either simply do not understand baghdad or they are lying to you
63419 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
63420 i went back to the room after meetings heard it saw it just kind of chuckled because i have no idea where it came from i have no idea where those stories come from
63421 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
63422 i thought that would be something they wouldnt do or try to stay away from as far as here i like the guys we have behind center right now in kyle and rex and i think those guys can definitely take us through
63423 he never sat still he never shut up he would never stop asking questions
63424 he just wanted to go from one thing to another
63425 he might be rocking on the kickboard as hes waiting to swim
63426 thats the thing if i dont want to lose i can focus
63427 he i guess saw something in me and really has never given up on me through good times and bad
63428 hes been able to help me grow from the little 11 year old swimmer who didnt really know what he was doing to the person i am today
63429 not accomplishing a goal no matter what it is for me just makes me want it that much more
63430 when i didnt medal i was like all right well then im going to do this
63431 within seven months he set a world record in the 200 butterfly
63432 hes got a lot of biological advantages plus that desire
63433 if i could sleep in the water and not leave it thats probably my safest bet
63434 i would never get hurt i would never have any problems
63435 when i first saw michael in 96 i looked at his stroke i looked at his body type and said this kid is going to be awesome
63436 i would have liked it but theres a time and place for everything and that wasnt the time or the place i guess
63437 hes going to do as we say a little schooling to the rest of the world
63438 when im swimming i can make myself relax in any way whether its dont kick or dont pull as hard
63439 in the prelim of a race i wont use as much legs ill just do what i have to do to get in the finals
63440 what you clearly saw in melbourne is michael was the best in the world from the time his feet hit the wall until he takes his first stroke
63441 when your lungs are burning and you can hardly feel your arms and youre battling a guy head to head and then all of a sudden he gets a turbo boost and youve got to run him down
63442 but my mind is focused on the job that i have to do
63443 its just easy for me to do that i dont know why
63444 i had watched him play and i was not impressed steve tambellini vice president of player personnel insisted that i go watch him at the end of the ohl playoffs last spring
63445 after my guy finished i was thinking boy were not asking for enough money
63446 not only do we tell users the phases of the sales cycle but we also tell them how to complete the sale effectively
63447 that lets the salesperson follow up in a timely manner when clients show interest
63448 its nice to see traditional crm merge with what we call sales knowledge management
63449 a lot of products take sales training and embed it into crm systems but for the most part these only tell a sales rep what to do get to the cio understand customer needs and so on
63450 i dont have all my sales collateral on the blackberry i still carry around my laptop with the data sheets and price sheets
63451 its not a good format for doing intense data sharing
63452 compared to that only 0 01 to 0 5 percent of identities stolen in external data breaches was misused
63453 in the past fraudsters preferred to target bank cards now weve found a larger proportion of fraudsters targeting the wireless industry than expected
63454 are one of the main tools to pull out data because theyre quick and theyre easy to conceal and use
63455 theres always the fact that theres a human being is at the center of data security and thats going to be a challenge because its not something you can replace with automation or software or hardware
63456 broad interest events are when we see spikes in traffic which is the perfect time for hackers and cybercriminals to do their bidding
63457 the increasing number of compromised sites during these times presents a greater opportunity of host infection on the client side
63458 you want to limit access to certain times such as before working hours during the lunch time or after five
63459 streaming video has the potential of overloading mission critical bandwidth
63460 if you dont have a web filtering solution this is difficult to enforce
63461 making sure that your security solution is updated and enforcing your acceptable use policy with regards to prevention will help ensure that youre safe
63462 i dont think the online traffic for sporting events is high enough to matter that much to the average firms network performance
63463 quebec likes to look within itself thats not to say other provinces or countries are better at this and that quebec cant do it
63464 everyone has ownership of their data and there doesnt seem to be a common corporate strategy to share that data
63465 gut feel basically becomes drowned under this sea of information
63466 emotions take over reason gives way to emotion and thats very bad when youre conducting business
63467 and its so fundamental this is not a new invention
63468 the best songs the beatles write add dimensions of experience and imagination to our lives revealing new realms into which we might not have entered without a little help
63469 so much of its melody line is disguised harmony that singing it without chordal support makes for comic results
63470 the melody of the voice parts is very difficult to sing particularly without the underlying chords to keep you oriented have you tried singing this song in the shower lately
63471 the words werent so meaningful but the chord changes really had magic in them
63472 they were doing things nobody was doing their chords were outrageous just outrageous and their harmonies made it all valid
63473 plunge from the home key of g major onto an unstable b minor
63474 in short they had no preconceptions about the next chord an openness which they consciously exploited
63475 remember to let her into your heart and then you can start to make it better
63476 yeah ill tell you something i think youll understand when i say that something i want to hold your hand
63477 much of the pairs musical originality derived from their self taught willingness to let their fingers discover chord sequences by exploring the architecture of their guitars rather than following orthodox progressions of which they knew little
63478 the rise and fall of the experimental style of the beatles
63479 the beatles and their times thoughts on the relative autonomy of stylistic change
63480 rock is a four letter word which means a new awakening
63481 a beatles odyssey alan w pollacks musicological journey through the beatles songs
63482 the manager milind babul is not here at the moment
63483 if the toll booth attendant does not enter your car registration number it is understood that the nhai logs would not contain your car number i would call on the contractor to check this i must admit that during peak traffic conditions the attendants skip the vehicle registration numbers
63484 its ironical that lakhs are spent on vips for their personal safety and they are surrounded by nsg commandos but when it comes to public safety priority is low
63485 however now we believe the situation is better and there is no need to panic the city has bounced back quite strongly after this adversity
63486 the old city has a charm of its own and we have been regularly exploring it we never thought such a disaster would strike there
63487 after news of serial blasts started flashing we immediately held a meeting with security officials and students for stepping up security on campus we assured all students of full security and advised them not to panic
63488 i had to call them to tell them we are all safe now im in regular touch with parents through email and phone to keep them informed
63489 those leaving are mostly non resident gujaratis who were visiting the city the number of foreigners on international flights has remained 10 20 per cent
63490 as part of the investigation we had come to know that some of those who were arrested had links with ansari a resident of nayapura mg road indore but every time we try to get him here from sagar we are told by mp police that several offences are registered against him right from year 2000 and he is required for the investigation in indore
63491 police officials once again went to mp to get ansari in january this year to avoid any problems the officials carried along the court warrant for his transfer to gujarat but by then he was already shifted to another jail and the officials were asked to get production warrant and not the court transfer warrant

63493 i hope this sends a message that will be a deterrent to anyone else who is considering a similar act of this nature
63494 we went in the house and found homemade explosive devices
63495 they used black powder from shotgun shells for the explosive material in the pipe bombs
63496 their plan was to detonate the pipe bombs in a public area located at a school
63497 the school was reportedly near founders credit union in mecklenburg county
63498 when police responded to that explosion their plan was to go in and rob the credit union
63499 i hate to think of what could have happened had they detonated those devices
63500 out of their reckless and disregard for human life lives could have been lost

63519 the original conviction for a sexually violent offense acts as an anchor around which other pieces of evidence may be cemented
63520 it is appropriate for the state to evaluate accumulated evidence of anti social character traits along with the current mental state of an inmate and then initiate proceedings under the law when the person is incarcerated for an unrelated crime
63521 we are pleased that the courts opinion adopted the attorney generals argument and expanded the reach of our sexually violent predator statute
63522 given the fundamental liberty interests involved in this case any statutory ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the preservation of liberty

63544 we need to settle this case for as little as possible we are in a tight budget time
63545 the mayor denies these allegations and if he is reasonably confident that he and the city will prevail in court then he should get his day in court
63546 the mayor has a lot to risk by going to trial
63547 he is certainly not being smart with the money but as long as he is being that stubborn then let him have his day in court

63562 people are so frustrated theyre at least willing to contemplate the idea
63563 the argument cant just be about big multibillion dollar plans over the next 30 to 50 years its got to be about things they can do now that will bring the price down
63564 the reason weve seen prices soften in last couple of weeks is that demand is down
63565 it shows you what can happen if people actually do something themselves

63567 we are absolutely committed to disciplined economic management but we must also recognise the underlying strengths of the australian economy and the fact that our surplus gives us a buffer against international uncertainty
63568 i think customers will be absolutely filthy if the banks do not pass on within a reasonable time any official cash rate reductions
63569 they have been seeking to slow our economy that has been their policy and we have asked them how many jobs is this going to cost what is it going to mean to people paying off their mortgages

63574 others in the ioc say there are no restrictions so well see im finding it a little confusing
63575 we can get better access in a place called the mpc which is where accredited journalists like myself are working
63576 we can access websites such as amnesty and bbc china which were blocked before
63577 however we have also tested outside this mpc building and i would say that those websites anyone outside the venue would have great trouble getting through still today and falungong you can not get onto any of those websites anywhere in china

63588 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
63589 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
63590 i find that underneath the glossy surfaces the subtext of these plays is actually quite subversive

63605 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
63606 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
63607 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months

63617 politics does not shape culture culture shapes politics that has limited the rights long term political success in the past half century because peoples basic assumptions come from our liberal dominated culture from the education system entertainment and the media and these are all areas that conservatives have largely abdicated to the left we cannot move america back to the values our country was founded on solely through politics only a serious conscious effort toward cultural renewal can do that
63618 there are several fine organizations on the right attempting to influence culture but they are a separate and dispersed lot
63619 our objective is not only to bring more right of center individuals into the cultural influence professions but also to create a grand narrative of cultural renewal to make a case for the development of a culture of liberty in the united states today we will create a synergy and connection among all these groups and individuals whose efforts can make a bigger impact through cooperation and outreach beyond the right
63620 our think tank will do what other think tanks do write books position papers op eds and analyses run conferences and seminars and the like but with the objective of educating the culture industries about the value of liberty instead of writing for legislators and their staffs and people at other think tanks the culture project will target public school administrators hollywood agents producers and scriptwriters law school faculty members newspaper editors museum managers and other important people in the cultural influence professions
63621 what is most revolutionary about this is that our efforts will not be pursued as part of a culture war or from a polemical or partisan perspective we want to educate and persuade those who lean left not fight with them we want them to know we take their work seriously not just sitting in judgment on them but appreciating their accomplishments and we want them to know that they too will benefit from the establishment of a true culture of liberty in the united states

63631 the justice system worked we need to find a way to move on it was a tragedy its going to take years to recover for family and friends not just parents but for friends and relatives perpetrators dont understand the impact their actions have on the lives of others for their whole lifetime

63670 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
63671 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
63672 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted

63706 i know i dont know where caylee is i just met with the detectives this afternoon and they didnt say anything about her having any information that right now would help us locate caylee any quicker
63707 we still feel that the key lies with casey and if she would just open up and just tell us where caylee is this could very well end quickly
63708 casey has given them as much information as she feels comfortable that she can say without jeopardizing the safety of caylee and her family
63709 i dont believe she has hurt her child or been a part of that
63710 she feels like all theyve done is focus on casey casey casey she feels like its been tunnel vision

63717 yeah ill definitely let you know if things come up
63718 the only people she can speak openly with are her defense lawyers as long at its a criminal investigation of casey then casey has to watch what she says

63739 this is a plan that is straight out of the 1970s
63740 it is certainly not a balanced approach because she is saying no no no to any new production i recognize there is no single solution but we need to push on all fronts not say no no no
63741 we need to increase domestic production lets drill on the 68 million acres they arent drilling on
63742 this is what he did against shaheen in 2002 with social security many republicans were running away from privatization but sununu embraced it and in the closing weeks of that campaign talked a lot about it
63743 i think thats what hes trying to do with energy
63744 its a shame that people have had to watch as the senate failed to even get up or down votes on these ideas while oil is at 120 or 130 per barrel
63745 unfortunately what weve got from john sununu is the unwillingness to address the other measures that we need
63746 she was very strict about what we were doing for the person before the board was the right thing she and former board chairman bruce geiger always listened to the people she was a pleasure to work with and she rarely missed a meeting and when edna had made up her mind you knew she wouldnt change it
63747 she always had everything set up when i got there
63748 she always wanted to make it better she made sure the uniforms were all cleaned before parades she wanted us to make a good appearance
63749 she had a way of cooking with cast iron skillets and dutch ovens
63750 i had her new england boiled dinner on one campout so unique to have a meal like that cooked in the wood coals
63751 edna was always ready to talk to people about the cannon and the artillery
63752 she encouraged people to join the company she felt the artillery was very important to the town to preserve the history of it
63753 she was one of those people who was always there shell be sorely missed by a lot of people
63754 she kept it a few years she and her sister used ride in it in parades
63755 i thought she was a great person there was nobody like her
63756 the best option is to be as frugal as possible and if there is still a shortfall they should do the one thing that associations can do which is to assess the owners as necessary
63757 if a minority of the homeowners cant afford the assessments maybe those owners need to find another place to live
63758 i could not pick it up from the end but i felt it had hit the helmet i feel if sri lankan fielders knew about it then appealing for the catch was against the spirit of the game
63759 you hate to see that happen to anybody but we just treat everyone the same
63760 i just want to be able to work and get off on the right foot lets stop wasting the taxpayers money
63761 i hope this is the end i just want to run the police department
63762 we would always prefer that the judge saw it our way
63763 im concerned that an appeal will be expensive it appeared to be the best decision at the time but we have to consider the judges decision
63764 there was a mutual mistrust between them which affected all aspects of their interaction
63765 the court has considered this in assessing the conduct and the motivations of the parties and their credibility
63766 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
63767 its extremely important if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
63768 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
63769 some said the rebates would not have an impact well they were wrong
63770 the stimulus checks are having an impact in spite of the energy prices
63771 provides one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economic picture
63772 it was very useful especially when you look at areas like getting formula
63773 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
63774 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
63775 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
63776 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
63777 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
63778 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
63779 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met
63780 you should not be jumping to conclusions about this case
63781 i guarantee this case is nothing like what has been reported so far
63782 its up 5 percent this year every year its usually up in the double digits
63783 to buy the material is as much as new lumber and usually two three or four times the cost
63784 it just continues to get more beautiful as you live with it
63785 the other thing with a reclaimed floor is its never dated
63786 you can always come back and upgrade your sofa down the road
63787 there is so much character that if a family would live on that they would just be adding to that patina
63788 you cannot totally replicate what 100 years does to something with factory equipment
63789 one of our barometers were seeing here is how many requests were getting for samples and thats actually gone up
63790 your very high end custom homes are still going out here
63791 theres definitely a larger scale of people calling in they want money i think theyve seen the rise in the reclaimed market and theyve seen the prices that certain companies get for the reclaimed market and they expect to make a considerable profit
63792 for most people it will be a savings of time and congestion
63793 especially for merrimack nashua and bedford it will be a lot shorter trip to the airport
63794 its an important link to provide efficient access to the airport
63795 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
63796 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier with trying to make the club better at this point in time than to do this we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
63797 we expect him to be here tomorrow and most likely play
63798 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
63799 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
63800 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
63801 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
63802 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
63803 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
63804 hes one of the greatest hitters ever to play the game its going to be a battle between us starting tonight
63805 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
63806 ev you arent going to get into bed with that dirty shirt on are you
63807 how do i currently dry my sweaters maybe i am not doing it the right way
63808 10 year warranty vince i am not planning to leave this thing for my kids
63809 its in the back of my head but you just focus on getting your stuff right
63810 you want to keep the streak going but you just want to win this game just like any other
63811 coming from summer and going into that your bodys getting beat up but other than that everythings been going good they teach it pretty well so right now our defense is looking sharp we have all our packages in so its looking good
63812 well mix it up with an i wing and a spread formation and things are going well so far
63813 its hard where its not the guys you are used to playing with in high school but its going well
63814 everyones very competitive and it should be a good game
63815 i think i fit in well with what ive seen so far so hopefully well do well
63816 the coaches in the state are very good about getting us those films
63817 i think we made some good decisions regarding the kids on this team but unfortunately we lost a few early and in the last few days as well
63818 our defense is way ahead and offensively our timing is getting better
63819 im finally back from the physically unable to perform list and im excited to be out here with my teammates
63820 its fun to get back out here its exciting any time you get a chance to play football with the patriots team to play in the national football league its a tremendous honor i dont take it for granted
63821 its good to be out here today and well see what happens tomorrow and well move forward nothing is promised in the national football league with injuries and all the things that can happen ill probably take it day by day and work hard and get better and see how i can help the team
63822 its funny that you ask that because my workouts have really increased and the passion is still there
63823 if it wasnt i definitely wouldnt be here i would be home with my boys and my little daughter and not on this practice field i would never take an opportunity like this and take it for granted so if i didnt have that same passion that same fire and desire i wouldnt be here
63824 im out here and thats the only thing that matters
63825 im out here and im ready to go im excited about it im flying around out there and im ready for the season
63826 a do i feel like getting up in the morning at 5 30 and working out twice a day doing all of the little things that it takes in order to keep yourself in great shape and b do i want to continue to hit people and fly around and be a part of these meetings and both answers are yes
63827 i still have that passion i still feel pretty good i watched myself on tape and im still moving halfway decent so im excited and coach bill belichick he still wants me to play here my teammates still support me so im excited
63828 it was nice to see him out there yesterday he was out there for all of the spring practices and camp he has a confidence and a presence out there that is special
63829 i am sure everyone on the field not just the defensive backs but all the defensive players the coaches and the offensive players feel that presence and confidence they feel that air that he brings in when we walks on the field
63830 its good you should read it go and buy it
63831 the hard part for me was this derailed into a train wreck so quick so fast and so oddly
63832 you had the buddha zen master guy in spring training reading and life is good dont worry be happy and it just looked like he was poised to have a monster season physically he worked his butt off
63833 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you doesnt want to be there doesnt want to obviously effort wise is just not there and thats disheartening and disappointing
63834 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
63835 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
63836 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
63837 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
63838 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
63839 i dont think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me im ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but its not the end of the world for me
63840 i play 16 to 18 tournaments a year and get the rest off
63841 and i like what i do so i just play im not sure that im going to play next year but i have plans to finish out this year and then im going to re evaluate and see but im getting close
63842 i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
63843 i dont know what to do its so disappointing that i cant post something low it seems like i cant play 18 holes
63844 on the 17th tee i got really mad a bad drive off the tee and i didnt hit a good chip
63845 but the rest i have no complaints i think the first day im not worried
63846 but the fragments cannot demonstrate the full picture of the spectacular opening ceremony
63847 nobody stopped us when we entered the main stadium on monday chinese officials let us in after we showed our id cards and we shot the rehearsal
63848 the purpose of the broadcast was aimed at heightening enthusiasm toward the beijing olympics by showing south korean viewers the magnificence of the opening ceremony there was no other intention
63849 the experience will stay with me forever to be part of the crowd and meet such wonderful friendly people from so many different countries to see pope benedict in person and to be so close to him was a wonderful experience which i will remember for the rest of my life it has made me realise that faith is still very strong world wide
63850 judging by the number of enquiries already received this is going to be one of the most interesting guyra council elections in years so it is gratifying to be provided with such great facilities
63851 it is important that people check their electoral roll details before the roll closes at 6pm on 4 august
63852 there is no absentee voting at local elections so people have to vote in the council or ward in which they are enrolled on election day
63853 anyone who wont be in their council or ward on 13 september should consider voting early postal voting commences on 18 august and pre polling begins on 1 september
63854 this is a major highlight for me in a lifetime of breeding merino sheep i am elated and honoured to win this award
63855 the australian fleece competition really provides wool producers both commercial and stud with a good demonstration of how their product compares with wool from other areas and states and it is now recognised as an excellent opportunity to showcase the australian wool industry to the world
63856 the very high average ranking for youtube definitely raise an eyebrow
63857 i totally disagree with this verdict as i have absolutely no reason to consider myself guilty naturally i will contest this
63858 id like to apologize to the fans that we have ended up in this position albeit through no guilt of our own
63859 if these athletes who are the main contenders for gold medals are forced out of the games the new favorites will automatically be the chinese
63860 why are last years doping tests suddenly emerging as an issue one week before the start of the olympic games
63861 he thought i would be working i said even if i am working heck we can figure something out you should go and do this so he called back and reluctantly agreed
63862 when he made the olympic team it was like he didnt like stealing anybody elses thunder even when he was the guy who caught the roar
63863 ryan can take the miles with him to beijing along with the memory of having his whole community cheer him on as he takes a lap for us at the middle school before leaving for the games for those of us who wont be at the games its the next best thing
63864 he has the highest dedication to running of anybody ive ever seen
63865 removing this record is the right thing to do pure and simple
63866 we have no interest in a record that the facts not rumors have exposed as being achieved by fraudulent means by at least one athlete on the team
63867 yet what i did doesnt seem to get highlighted which makes me upset
63868 i dont think ive had half as much press as i probably could or should have had
63869 in many ways im also happy that people dont seem to talk me up
63870 id rather they forget about me its more comfortable that way because it lets me get on with things
63871 the next time i will step on my blocks will be at the olympic games in beijing
63872 put a lid on my training and not do any crazy workouts your instincts tell you to train harder but my coach dennis shaver has to keep telling me rest is crucial at this stage of preparation
63873 it feels weird people coming up to me when ive been shopping and they are offering to buy me dinner
63874 hayley always said that she wouldnt go to the camp if paula did
63875 darchinyan has a very unorthodox style but it makes no difference i will fight the way i always have i will use my boxing skills and strategy to keep him off me
63876 it does not matter how much power he has or he says he has ive been in the ring with big punchers before whatever vic darchinyan has its not enough to beat me
63877 freddie roach his trainer tells me the bigger they punch the harder they punch the harder they fall
63878 i feel very at home in tacoma and im looking forward to defending my title on saturday
63879 kirilov has never been kod before hes going to get his first knockout this saturday
63880 i have not made any changes in my game plan against nonito donaire i just got caught thats all if anything i am more focused than i ever was before my left hand is much stronger my right hand is faster
63881 i never respect my opponents before i fight them i respect them only after i knock them out i help them wake up and help them to their corner
63882 i am here as a proud rep of my home town of vanadzor armenia i am also very proud to fight out of australia
63883 i am here to put on another exciting show for showtime i am going to fill up your highlight reel
63884 everyone at the emerald queen casino is going to hear my punches lefts and rights the people come out to watch the ko and thats what i am here for
63885 freddie roach kirilovs trainer says i am predictable the only thing he can predict is that his boy is going to get knocked out
63886 silver or gold i do not have but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth walk

63906 in a study by detc 100 percent of the supervisors who responded to the survey said that a they felt that distance education degree graduates performed better on the job as a result of their degrees and b a person receiving a distance education degree compared favorably in terms of knowledge learned by someone with a resident degree
63907 i still view this as close to the equivalent of earning a ged through a sally struthers correspondence course
63908 elitism in education is one of the most ridiculous entities that i think can think of
63909 the acceptability of online degrees earned as credential for obtaining employment
63910 learning style and effectiveness of online and face to face instruction
63911 the results revealed no significant differences between online offline student although the online groups averages were slightly higher
63912 some students come into these courses with the attitude thinking that well its online so its going to be easy it isnt easier its harder
63913 what makes the difference a practical analysis of research on the effectiveness of distance education
63914 students who earn their degree need to be more capable and driven to find work to market their degree
63915 there is little understanding that these are working professionals often getting advanced degrees while working 40 hours a week matching theory to experience
63916 while working 40 hours a week matching theory to experience
63917 what im tired of is hearing outdated opinions about how horrible all online education is thats just not true

63920 the threat of global warming became became more important in washington earlier this year when a group of retired admirals and generals issued a report on its potential impact on national security one of the authors retired admiral joe prueher who headed the pacific fleet and became u s ambassador to china from 1999 2001 now lives in virginia beach prueher and retired captain joe bouchard now a virginia beach delegate talk about the challenges posed by rising seas both here and abroad
63921 we have considerable concern however with the proposed lease sale areas within the mid atlantic planning area off the coast of virginia
63922 the draft program option of greatest concern to the department of defense involves the special interest sale proposed for the mid atlantic off the coast of virginia the proposed area lies within the virginia capes vacapes operations areas where the navys training and test and evaluation community conducts significant activity
63923 the vacapes undersea surface and air space areas are critical to the development fielding and certification of naval weapon systems as a consequence the navy requires unencumbered access to the full expanse of this operations area
63924 because hazards in this area to operating crews and oil company equipment and structures would be so great the department opposes oil and gas development activity in this ocs planning location
63925 proposed final program 2007 2012 map and completely poised along with western and central gulf of mexico for lease sales the moment congress lifts the moratorium on offshore drilling

63928 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
63929 the owner requested we terminate the dogs for them based on the behavior and what the officers could see they were obviously very vicious
63930 monsters do exist in us and among us they walk in our shadow they can prey on us more as we fear them less we should know we created them
63931 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
63932 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
63933 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
63934 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
63935 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
63936 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
63937 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
63938 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
63939 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
63940 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
63941 theres going to be other things coming down the pipe thats going to give psn as a whole a competitive edge

63991 the global non oil commodity price hikes appear prolonged and are expected to take longer to unwind
63992 sentiment is more focused on slowing demand rather than short term supply disruptions

64020 its not our intention to do any campaigning for or against any politicians
64021 its more just to have a little bit of fun around a contemporary issue that is of relevance to new zealanders because of the exposure it has received

64043 unfortunately some special interests have declared war on the initiative process using tactics ranging from restrictive laws to outright thuggery
64044 representative government will remain the enduring feature of american democracy but the initiative process is a valuable safety valve attempts to arbitrarily curb the initiative or to intimidate people from exercising their right to participate must be resisted its a civil liberties issue that should unite people of good will on both the right and left
64045 i believe in the initiative and referendum which should be used not to destroy representative government but to correct it whenever it becomes misrepresentative
64046 put front and center empowering the american people in direct democracy format so they can move in when their so called representatives cave in to the interests of big business campaign finance reform has got to go hand in hand with direct democracy like initiative referendum recall
64047 more direct democracy reflecting the preamble to our constitution which starts with we the people and not we the corporations

64055 out of the box the christian experience of god in trinity
64056 because you are sons god has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba
64057 from the beginning the christian knowledge of god in trinity was first experiential and later theoretical an order of things that has always characterized authentic christian understanding and confession
64058 as you father are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me
64059 divinity and personal existence is totally dependent on the father who communicates to him everything that he the son is and has
64060 proceed ing from the father and according to the western tradition from the son as well
64061 revisiting the doctrine of the trinity in hopes of promoting a more democratic church order
64062 christians who believe in and are baptized in the name of the triune god father son and holy spirit are conjoined in a deep supernatural union but they still fall short of the full visible unity that christ wills for his church

64065 i have put forth my energy and every effort to enrich this organization and enlisted the help of what i believe to be a phenomenal staff of intelligent sophisticated and progressive individuals who have stood ready to work hard and assist in accomplishing the goals i believe we had to achieve in order to survive the many challenges facing this international
64066 extremely proud of these accomplishments and the i a t s e has been such an important part of my life as hard as it is for me to believe that this time has come i am now prepared to move on i am not leaving for political reasons or for health reasons but rather because i have learned that life is short and there is a great deal that i have yet to experience and enjoy
64067 just wait until april 09 it will get better with the new contract
64068 yes this place holds its beauty but like all beautiful things it will fade with time
64069 i suppose your right so we might as well enjoy the beauty while we can do you mind if i sit awhile with you
64070 no one you can just tell the way you were sitting and looking up at the stars when i first stumbled upon you before you realized i was here you looked so hopeless and sad and when you looked around when i told you i thought this place was beautiful its like you saw nothing at all
64071 of course i do i wouldnt have sat down if i didnt want to know you
64072 what if i told you i come with a ton of bullshit
64073 if i told you i was cursed and that a life with me would change yours forever that you would never see the light of day would you walk into my darkness and choose to stay
64074 we support the setting up of the industries in these areas but at the same time the companies should give first preference to the locals
64075 as such we still have the case pending pertaining to the above issue in the central empowered committee cec
64076 it is a clear warning from the river of things to come in the future for the dams so why are the authorities determined to continue with these doubtful projects the general secretary questioned with the central ministry of power and energys recent stance to change their policy regarding the run of the rivers projects in the country act felt that the authorities in the state can also change their stand in scrapping the projects which are opposed as clearances and concurrence are yet to be obtained from the central authorities recently the union secretary for power and energy has declared that run of the river projects will not be given priority taking specific example of teesta v and the losses and problems it has incurred due to the flooding and heavy siltation
64077 the threats of the last few days are a cause for serious concern for nepali catholics
64078 they are a sign of the growing sense of insecurity that is felt especially by christians
64079 we have informed the government of our concerns but so far have not seen any improvement
64080 catholic schools as well as welfare and charitable institutions but insists that
64081 government is aware of the threat and has informed the security services
64082 nepal government has deployed special security forces to guard some catholic institutions
64083 intimidations are the work of hindu fundamentalists who have already attacked groups of catholic workers in the past
64084 is there anything i can do for you dear is there anyone i could call
64085 no and thank you please madam i aint lost just wandering
64086 we are opposed to such moves as demonstrating against a guest whatever his past is not acceptable in bengali culture
64087 we are fully aware of the gnlf leaders murky past yet we think he should be allowed to stay in peace here in accordance with the much acclaimed humanistic culture of the land
64088 had the problems been addressed in the right manner the separate statehood demand would not have gained momentum with the hill people
64089 i emphasised on the formation of the second states re organisation commission src and the inclusion of darjeeling in the list of smaller states both the leaders have adopted a positive approach towards the formation of the src and inclusion of gorkhaland in it
64090 nobody can question my loyalty towards the gorkhaland demand during the 1986 agitation the party removed me from the general secretary post of pradesh congress committee because i supported the demand for a separate state i had convinced the then pm rajiv gandhi for a union territory status for darjeeling but gnlf denounced it saying that the status was meant only for tribals and not civilised people of darjeeling gorkhaland would have been achieved by now had we pursued the union territory status
64091 it has really become a challenging and a difficult task to convince the regular customers about the shortfall in the supply of poultry products from siliguri
64092 chicken momos are the best selling items and there is a huge demand but it is not cost effective any more
64093 whenever we get to procure locally reared chicken which comes at an unregulated rate of rs 180 200 per kg and in a limited quantity we do serve our regular customers with chicken dishes in particular chicken momos but it continues only for a day or two
64094 also the absence of eggs have also affected the menu forcing us to discontinue many egg dishes
64095 we will call a board meeting within a week or so and decide on our further course of action and until then we will keep pressuring the state government through the ah amp vs department for lifting the ban
64096 we have been hearing reports about dead chickens in some of the areas in darjeeling and cooch behar districts but we are not sure whether the chickens died of the bird flu virus the west bengal administration is still investigating the actual cause of death of poultry chicken
64097 we are awaiting the reports of viscera tests from calcutta for a final conclusion
64098 as the post mortems hinted that the pachyderms had died because of poisoning we have initiated precautionary steps like writing to the planters associations and campaigning in the gardens with an aim to avoid the recurrence of such incidents
64099 there are high chances of elephants consuming water contaminated with pesticides in the estates
64100 that the deaths of the three elephants had almost synchronised with the illness of some workers who were spraying pesticides in the plantations points to poisoning being the cause of the tragedy
64101 so it is imperative that the planters refrain from anything which may harm humans and animals
64102 the forest department should inform us about the steps it has taken to keep wild elephants away from gardens we are ready to co operate on the pesticide issue and have already circulated the letter to our members
64103 didi mamata has asked us to follow up on her demand
64104 the congress stand is really confusing one of its members of parliament is holding dialogue with the partys chief sonia gandhi in favour of the formation of a separate state at the same time its state president das munshi has been saying that they are against the idea of further division of bengal
64105 it has not done anything for the development of the hills unemployment is also a reason for such a movement
64106 what we wanted to know from the government is what it has done so far regarding the sixth schedule status for the hills and how it views the renewed demand for a separate state of gorkhaland
64107 bhattacharya alleged that trinamul had connections with morcha leaders which is not true he levelled the charge a couple of months ago after the leader of the opposition met morcha hunger strikers at salbari when the fast was on across north bengal
64108 we believe in gandhian principles and the morcha supporters were following them to pursue their demands there is always something beyond election politics and our senior leader chatterjee had expressed his solidarity with their methods by meeting them it does not mean that we support their movement
64109 the solar eclipse which would be total in some parts of the world would be partial in north bengal with the obscurity varying from 60 to 65 per cent
64110 it is not advisable for anybody to watch the eclipse with x ray plate ordinary sunglasses or smoke glasses
64111 this can lead to severe ophthalmic complications including retinal blindness
64112 a small mirror measuring 1 5cm to 2cm in diameter can be used to reflect the sun in a wall
64113 let me tell you about a miracle that happened to me 15 years ago how god healed me
64114 my house was ghearoed by the kurseongs morcha unit last evening and they demanded that i resign from the mlas post for the cause of gorkhaland i am willing to do it if the other elected representatives including the municipality councillors put in their papers for the cause of statehood

64123 love and loss for example gives the contrast the wide range of emotions that we need to experience in order to appreciate each other by dampening our emotional response what kind of world will we create

64152 that would be wonderful how long will it take you to find out where i can sell this

64165 we tried to move both of them that was our preference when we got to the deadline today and just didnt have any interest we felt it was better to deal with it this way
64166 i apologize to the organization and the fans im a better baseball player than i played
64167 to give me a chance to hook on with another team big time class act
64168 it didnt go well for me here its not the end of the world
64169 were going to get younger for the last two months
64170 we want players that are going to hustle and play the game hard and play the game right
64171 we need to give younger players the opportunity and were going to do that
64172 gonzalez is coming over here mainly because of the guzman injury and we need him to play shortstop
64173 that being said were going to try to see the younger guys
64174 he wants to play in the nba and for the cleveland cavaliers
64175 they said take the deal weve offered or well go an alternate route
64176 they made an offer to delonte for around what they got boobie to sign for
64177 chris duhon got 5 million plus and he might not even start for the new york knicks
64178 they keep saying how much players want to play with lebron james that doesnt work with delonte
64179 delonte is their starting point guard he has to play offense and defense he has to play defense against guys like washingtons gilbert arenas
64180 i think hes hard nosed gritty he can help that team its not apples for apples
64181 to quote another team why should we negotiate for the cavs
64182 if we make an offer all theyll do is match
64183 teams hide behind the first refusal clause the right to match anything other teams see value in west but cleveland doesnt
64184 if they go get someone else the hand is set if we sit down and work something out well get something done we are not posturing thats where he wants to be
64185 quit telling us these bluffs sit down and negotiate a fair deal they are making offers not far off the qualifying offer
64186 i felt i needed to comment so the cavs fans dont think we are being unrealistic and dont know the market
64187 as ive said all along weve got three quarterbacks battling for the position
64188 j ts not back in it hes been in it this quarterback position is open whoever gives us the best chance to win is the guy
64189 i think right now its just organized chaos and theyre just trying to learn all this stuff
64190 i had no expectations about when my reps would come
64191 im strictly about me being ready if they would have said the first day to jump in there i would have been ready if they say a month from now im going to be ready its about me doing my job as well as i can it doesnt change if im in the first group or the fifth group
64192 i feel fine its just noticeably tired coaches felt like i needed a rest so thats what we did its kind of normal for this time of year were ready to go now
64193 i see a guy thats bounced around the league a little bit but theres no question to me that j t osullivan is tough hes competitive and hes resilient
64194 now if he can play quarterback that would be great
64195 my wife gave me lance armstrongs biography which tells what he went through to overcome a serious illness his will power
64196 i really enjoyed it because it talks about surmounting problems and it shows that we must always fight to reach our goals
64197 i have to make it clear that he is one of the best persons in football he is always willing to help is aware of what you need that is very important
64198 it changed my life in a way that all manchester people remind me of it which is nice in 30 years time people will remember me as a united player that is not the worst thing you can be remembered for it could have been as the guy who missed that great chance in the final
64199 my relationship with the fans has been absolutely fantastic since the first game i came on and no one knew who i was though the affection cannot only be down to that one goal there has to be something else they liked about me
64200 i went to angola a few months ago and you could see clearly how much things were needed down there
64201 the aim through my testimonial is to try and build 10 schools if i can generate more money through a scheme we have set up in norway maybe we can generate enough to build five more
64202 as a father i recognise how helpless these kids are if it was my children i would do absolutely anything for them so it is more important for me to be remembered for helping these people than anything i have done with football
64203 johnny is a strong target man and a player i should enjoy playing alongside brosque said after training in preparation for saturdays must win pre season cup match with wellington phoenix in wollongong
64204 hopefully he gets back on the field as quickly as possible so we can start working on some combinations
64205 johnny is a big striker who has to be heavily marked even by two men so this should open up some space and a few opportunities for me to run off him that will take some of the pressure off me
64206 i am very excited with the prospect of teaming up with aloisi as far as strikers go in this country they do not come much better than aloisi as far as natural goalscoring is concerned
64207 i had a bit of a niggly injury to the groin a few weeks ago nothing serious brosque said
64208 i missed only one game but im fine now we are still trying different things we have played with one two and three strikers we like to keep things unpredictable but when johnny comes in he will be a big factor in whether we win games or not
64209 pre season is going well were looking good as a team apart from the loss last week were improving from week to week which is important come melbourne victory in round one well be ready to go
64210 sometimes things go well in a game and on other occasions i struggle to get involved he said
64211 its one of those things and something ive got to work on if one could play a perfect game very week there would be no problem at all
64212 all players feel the pressure when they do not score but its part and parcel of the game kosmina said
64213 if you want to play in the a league and play up front you have to score goals
64214 he was unlucky in gosford he got into the right areas its when strikers do not get into scoring positions that you have a problem
64215 hell be right and spending a bit more time on his finishing and composure hell get better
64216 we were told yesterday that yellow cards carry over to the league kosmina said
64217 apart from his ability on the park i think his experience off it was the thing that attracted me and im just very happy that hes agreed with terms and will play for the roar for the next two years
64218 something that we havent had in my time with the club is a genuine out and out playmaker who can create opportunities and its good to have that string to our bow now
64219 im 32 years old now maybe when i was 18 i felt the pressure but definitely not now
64220 i spoke to frank and it was great hes ambitious he wants to win im 32 and i still want to win myself i like to win trophies and i think weve got a great bunch of boys here
64221 we knew we were up against a strong team one in which you can already see the imprint of new barca boss pep guardiola
64222 were still not in our best physical condition but we will be ready for the preliminaries matches which were really looking forward to
64223 i tried to do my best and i was really happy to score
64224 i was aware that there was a 12 hour re entry protocol after firing of rock by explosives and i didnt want to go in
64225 i felt it was too soon after firing within 925 metre level and that as it broke the 12 hour period protocol it was a potentially dangerous time to be in that part of the mine
64226 i was a little taken aback as i knew i was being asked to break the rules
64227 the best way to get a good idea is to get a lot of ideas
64228 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
64229 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
64230 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
64231 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something

64247 its still flaming up there but theyve been on it day and night
64248 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
64249 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
64250 typically we dont see wildland fires of this magnitude until much later in the season
64251 but with the dry fuel conditions that we have throughout the state we could see similar situations arise again until we get a significant amount of rain

64417 marathon trade talks limped into another day on friday but with little progress so far on the tortuous negotiations ministers said it would soon be time to decide whether a deal was at all possible
64418 the make or break talks called this week to crack the deadlock in the world trade organisations wto long running doha round have failed to move far in the intractable issues ranging from farm subsidies to car import duties
64419 brazils foreign minister celso amorim said after thursdays meeting ended that the talks had not broken up so far and there was interest in continuing but time was running out
64420 u s trade representative susan schwab said that despite some progress the talks had not moved as much as washington hoped to slash its farm subsidies
64421 the talks were originally due to run until saturday but delegates say they are likely to either flop before then because of the deep differences or drag on into next week
64422 u s farmers could support a bigger subsidy cut than proposed by u s negotiators this week in world trade talks if countries like china and india improved offers to open their markets a u s farm industry leader said
64423 but chances of that happening dont look real favourable given the attitude of the advanced developing countries and their seeming failure to want to seriously negotiate bob stallman president of the american farm bureau federation the largest u s farm group said in an interview on thursday
64424 u s trade representative susan schwab offered on tuesday to cap u s spending on trade distorting farm subsidies at
64425 leading developing countries like india and brazil want even deeper cuts arguing that high crop prices have pushed actual u s spending down to about 7 billion annually
64426 while that may be the case the u s proposal would have cut spending on subsidies in seven out of the past 10 years when prices were lower schwab said
64427 that makes it hard to sell to the u s farm community which so far does not see any significant new export opportunities coming from the deal stallman said
64428 absolutely if these countries would give us enough market access for our agricultural products to make up the difference but we are nowhere near them coming up with anything that would seem to indicate thats going to happen stallman said
64429 schwab also said the united states wants other countries to agree that they would not sue the united states to try to get the subsidy level below 15 billion
64430 the doha talks came under renewed attack from french president nicolas sarkozy worried about cutting eu farm tariffs for little return he said he could not sign a deal based on the current state of the negotiations
64431 those comments drew a rebuke from eu partner germany the worlds biggest exporter which has hoped a wto would boost its famous car chemical and other exporters
64432 one comes away with the impression that france does not want to see a positive conclusion said a german official
64433 french president nicolas sarkozy warned thursday that france would not sign a world trade organisation trade liberalisation deal currently on the table at talks in geneva unless it were modified
64434 at the wto this agreement which is on the table if it is not modified then we will not sign it sarkozy said
64435 european trade commissioner peter mandelson later shrugged off sarkozys threat insisting that as commissioner he held the mandate to negotiate on behalf of the eu
64436 i have no reaction except to say that the commission is charged with negotiating here at the wto on behalf of all the member states and we will continue to do so on the basis of the mandate we have
64437 this weeks summit talks at the world trade organization aimed at securing a new global trade deal are turning into a bad tempered marathon
64438 in an interview with a small group of reporters thursday mr nath said poorer countries need to keep the right to use tariffs to protect nascent industries like indias fledgling car sector and key food products at the same time he is demanding more cuts in u s farm subsidies
64439 in an attempt to resolve the standoff wto chief pascal lamy is holding meetings for only seven negotiators from the 30 some attendees at the summit the u s the european union china brazil australia japan and india the eus 27 nations negotiate trade as one
64440 the result on wednesday was a 12 hour session that eu trade commissioner peter mandelson called some of the most difficult and confrontational negotiations of his four year term the reason according to european u s and brazilian officials mr nath he just sat there and said no for 12 straight hours a trade official said
64441 the next 24 hours will determine whether governments can rescue wto talks from the brink of collapse officials said thursday evening
64442 a crucial day lies ahead for the ongoing attempt to strike framework deals on liberalising agricultural and industrial trade
64443 tomorrow is the day in which we will know if its possible or not brazilian foreign minister celso amorim told reporters thursday night
64444 a group of latin american and asian countries is proposing to break the divide between rich and poor nations with a compromise deal to tear down barriers in industrial commerce while allowing emerging economies to shield strategic sectors
64445 the proposal obtained by the associated press entails concessions for both sides and could serve as the basis of a world trade organization breakthrough on the other hand it could be universally rejected
64446 drafted by the so called middle ground countries which include chile costa rica mexico singapore and thailand the offer will be presented to wto delegations friday
64447 with the global economy slowing prices soaring for oil and food and protectionist passions boiling up everywhere it is an especially dangerous time to give up on international trade negotiations unfortunately the worlds leading trading nations seem ready to abandon the world trade organizations seven year effort to reduce some of the worlds obstacles to trade
64448 while the reluctance to cut farm subsidies in europe and the united states had been a main obstacle the big developing countries also bear a lot of responsibility
64449 at marathon meetings this week in geneva the united states offered to further lower the ceiling for its agricultural subsidies to roughly 15 billion a year from the current 48 billion europe with france objecting also fleshed out a new offer
64450 big developing countries notably brazil and india however are insisting on even deeper subsidy cuts
64451 we fear the whole process is on the verge of collapse this is the last chance to get a deal during the bush administration experts say
64452 a judge allowed hay production and cattle grazing on certain lands designated for conservation thursday helping farmers and ranchers struggling with high grain prices
64453 u s district judge john c coughenour said the u s department of agriculture did not conduct an appropriate environmental review before it opened 24 million acres of conserved land to haying and grazing but that a reversal would be unfair to farmers and ranchers counting on using that land
64454 the national wildlife foundation and its washington indiana south dakota arkansas louisiana and kansas chapters sought an injunction to stop the emergency haying and grazing program which was announced in may
64455 although the grazing and haying would only be allowed after primary nesting season ends july or august depending on the location the damage to bird habitat and water quality could last for years they argued
64456 the government responded that although 24 million acres were eligible farmers and ranchers were expected to apply to use only about 2 5 million that eased the concerns of the environmentalists somewhat
64457 the judge is limiting the program to those farmers and ranchers who applied to use conservation land for haying or grazing by july 8 the usda may approve other applicants who show they made investments before that date in anticipation of using their conserved land
64458 a group of u s agribusiness companies including archer daniels midland co are uniting in the intensifying food versus fuel debate forming an alliance to promote the idea that technology can ease global supply shortages
64459 the alliance for abundant food and energy which includes seed makers monsanto co
64460 adm monsanto and others have seen their own profits soar in recent years as booming demand for agricultural products in emerging markets has pushed up commodity prices and spurred additional production
64461 a new group is adding its voice to the debate on using crops to produce alternative fuels such as ethanol amid rising food prices and shortages in some countries
64462 the alliance for abundant food and energy in washington d c was created by archer daniels midland co dupont co deere amp co monsanto co and the renewable fuels association
64463 there are critics who are trying to create an either or decision between food and fuel said mark kornblau the alliances executive director
64464 the us on tuesday made the first significant move in this weeks politically fraught meeting of trade ministers in geneva cutting its proposed ceiling for farm subsidies to 15bn a year
64465 the move would reduce us farm subsidies deemed to distort international trade by about 2bn 1 3bn 1bn compared with the current offer in the so called doha round of trade talks much lower than the present ceiling of about 48bn
64466 but it would be comfortably above the uss recent real spending in trade distorting farm support estimated at 7bn 9bn a year
64467 brazil and india two of the uss main negotiating partners in the struggling world trade organisation talks dismissed the offer as inadequate this is a nice try but it is not enough said a spokesman for the brazilian foreign minister celso amorim it is not the final offer they can do
64468 the european union which will be under pressure to reduce its subsidies if the us offers bigger cuts
64469 us trade representative susan schwab said the offer was conditional on other countries opening their markets to us farm exports and agreeing not to launch litigation against us farm payments at the wto as has happened repeatedly one such case brought by brazil forced the us to revise its controversial cotton support subsidy programme
64470 the us offer did not change its existing proposal to limit the most trade distorting form of subsidies to an annual 7 6bn a year nor did it introduce new limits on the amount of money spent on any specific crop
64471 during a press conference schwab told reporters the u s would be willing to trim its offer on how much it could spend each year on trade distorting domestic farm programs from around 17 billion to no more than 15 billion in exchange for concessions on tariffs by developing nations
64472 they would require adjustments to our farm programs schwab said
64473 national farmers union president tom buis issued a statement decrying the schwab proposal as essentially a sell out of u s ag producers
64474 senate agriculture committee ranking member saxby chambliss r iowa was more cautious of the u
64475 washington is currently allowed to distribute over 48 billion in subsidies linked to price production and other trade distorting criteria
64476 anyone who understands farm programs will understand how significant the reduction is implied by this number said schwab noting that u s subsidies have exceeded her proposed limit in seven of the last 10 years
64477 without a global trade deal that includes the new u s offer they may exceed 15 billion again as part of the united states new five year farm bill worth nearly 300 billion that congress passed over president bushs veto
64478 under the wtos complex rules for classifying farm subsidies otds overall trade distorting support is made up of three components amber box payments the most distorting kind blue box payments less distorting and de minimis could be just like the amber box but allowed up to a certain percentage of the value of agricultural production
64479 the us new offer has left its proposed future cap on amber box payments untouched at 7 6 billion
64480 however the 2 billion reduction to these latter two components of otds may not do very much to place real new constraints on us spending suggested david blandford a professor of agricultural and environmental economics at pennsylvania state university
64481 india welcomed on wednesday an offer by the united states to limit its farm subsidies as part of efforts to save a global trade deal
64482 the first thing which we must take note of and must appreciate is that the united states is moving indian commerce minister kamal nath told reporters at last ditch world trade organisation talks in geneva over the doha trade round
64483 naths optimistic tone contrasted with his reaction earlier on wednesday to the u s offer which he called wholly inadequate washington had to give more but the move showed the deadlock had been broken he said
64484 the first day of green room talks among a representative group of ministers produced no new ideas but provided a clearer understanding of key issues and constraints wto director general pascal lamy reported to a morning meeting of the full membership today
64485 director general pascal lamy at the informal trade negotiations committee meeting on 23 july 2008 characterized the second round of consultations held the day before as constructive with a strong commitment to engaging directly and in good faith
64486 talks to save a global trade deal struggled into a third day on wednesday with emerging economies like brazil and south africa saying the united states had not done enough on farming to justify moves by them
64487 without a breakthrough in the coming days the world trade organisations doha negotiations risk further years of delay
64488 on tuesday the united states said it was ready to cut its annual ceiling on trade distorting farm subsidies to 15 billion a level lower than its spending in seven of the last 10 years in order to kick start the talks
64489 but india brazil and other big developing countries said washington had to make deeper cuts before they would offer concessions of their own because
64490 although professing optimism about this weeks crucial international trade negotiations in geneva brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva said wednesday his country would veto any agreement that doesnt provide for greater flexibility for trade in agricultural commodities
64491 a good accord under the doha round is one in which the europeans adopt a more flexible approach to trade in agricultural commodities and in which the united states reduced its agricultural subsidies the president said in remarks published by the governments official agencia brasil news service
64492 seven of the worlds largest trading powers emerged front and centre in the struggling talks at the wto on wednesday meeting all afternoon and late into the night in an attempt to find a way out of the impasse in governments push for breakthrough deals on agricultural and industrial goods trade
64493 we made progress but not enough said indian commerce minister kamal nath after the meeting which ended past 3am not enough for an agreement but not no progress for it to fail
64494 eu trade commissioner peter mandelson told reporters that there had been progress in the sense that after a great deal of very hard work some issues are nearer solution he declined to comment on the issues in question
64495 brazilian foreign minister celso amorim sounded a more sombre note saying that things were still fluid and that there is no balance yet
64496 as ministers gather around the wto negotiating table the week of july 21 in geneva there are troubling questions about whether the deal that is at hand is really worth doing and whether it is even possible to conclude an agreement at present given the political constraints especially those associated with a u
64497 this opinion brief argues that doha skeptics are missing the critical importance of a wto agreement in terms of imposing new disciplines and binding current practice in trade in agriculture industrial goods and services and that there are large benefits to be had from an agreement on trade facilitation and from ensuring the continuing trade relevance of aid for trade waiting is not a good option as upcoming elections around the world suggest that the political calendar for doha will become more not less unforgiving
64498 the u s agriculture department said wednesday it expects u s food prices to climb an additional 4 to 5 in 2009 as high grain prices continue to squeeze their way into the american diet
64499 the 2009 outlook the first by the department is lower than the 5 to 7 5 range issued by some private economists
64500 prices of corn and soybeans have dropped 27 and 14 over the past month still prices of these commodities remain twice as high as a year ago
64501 though recent studies have blamed u s ethanol mandates and subsidies for pushing demand and prices for corn higher a new farm foundation study suggests rising energy prices and a declining u s dollar are the main contributors to the increase in commodity prices whats driving food prices by purdue university professors phillip c abbott christopher hurt and wallace e tyner said that ethanol industry supporters and others have it right when they point to rising oil prices as a corn price driver
64502 the ethanol industry until recently a golden child that got favorable treatment from washington is facing a critical decision on its future
64503 gov rick perry of texas is asking the environmental protection agency to temporarily waive regulations requiring the oil industry to blend ever increasing amounts of ethanol into gasoline a decision is expected in the next few weeks
64504 mr perry says the billions of bushels of corn being used to produce all that mandated ethanol would be better suited as livestock feed than as fuel
64505 with another court hearing over conservation reserve program land slated for thursday in seattle secretary of agriculture ed schafer has shifted away from suggestions earlier this month that a decision on whether to allow an early out of crp land was imminent
64506 schafer had said before a hearing in the same court last week that he planned to make a quick decision on whether to allow early out without penalties
64507 were not sure how its going to affect what we do in crp in the short term or in the long run schafer said

64509 if for whatever reason they arent pleased with their cut or style we always make sure by the time they leave they are happy with their hair
64510 i will not be back for another season of gourmet next door
64511 the producers offered me more shows but with my family i decided it was time to move on to other projects the lifestyle and obligations of a television personality including cultivating the thick skin it takes to survive the harsh criticism and vicious personal attacks mounted by bloggers just arent compatible with my goals or my family at this time
64512 instead of static in the absence of our audio we were getting audio from another market
64513 and in our estimation would not be anywhere near meeting the minimum requirement for purchases
64514 for every person who dislikes a personality there are certainly others who like them
64515 so no it doesnt have any bearing on the name but when they came up with it they just thought it sounded classy like the university itself
64516 ive been looking forward to introducing them to mister rogers neighborhood for a long time since before they were born
64517 it was such a formative thing for me in my own childhood
64518 we cant get it without a rabbit ear antenna which im gonna go get
64519 i never thought id go back to rabbit ears but im going to go out and buy that stuff and find a way to hook it up
64520 its an inconvenience for us but i know a lot of areas where its going to be dropped altogether at least thats the plan
64521 id love for us to call every local member station in the country thats currently airing the program and say we think this needs to stay on the air for the sake of the children
64522 ive been really surprised at the number of program directors and ive talked to 10 so far so a handful of them who just dont have the information about pbs dropping the show from its daily feed i feel like i know more about it and have been educating some of the program directors about this situation
64523 preserve mister rogers neighborhood content and make it available on demand through web streaming so families can access it 24 7
64524 obviously were pleased people want to see mister rogers neighborhood why wouldnt we be
64525 the right thing to do is to talk to your local pbs station if thats what theyre encouraging people to do theyre doing the right thing
64526 its a shame for them to treat it like a museum piece because hes so relevant still as long as children need to be nurtured then there is a place for this program because theres nothing else like it
64527 some years it will be thicker and other years it wont be as bad
64528 usually its about four to five yards thick but here youve got about 10 yards thick all the way along the shoreline
64529 every little piece every little sprig grows into another plant so if you leave that plant material youll likely get more plants
64530 if i thought for one second there was even an iota of a chance of that happening that there was trouble on the horizon i wouldnt be leaving id stay on and work through it
64531 i just think what we have and what we have built is something special it is working it is working well the only reason i am stepping down is i hate flying but if i had to id still be getting on planes
64532 i feel it is a very good time to make a change because it is very quiet it is very calm right now for the new person to come on board and get into things slowly the political landscape changes every day though so you never know what will happen nine months from now but the camaraderie in this league and the unity is something truly unique
64533 we have two more years to go with the current bowl games but weve already begun to work on some things for the future
64534 i think it is incredible that we have a number of representatives from bowls that we are not aligned with here at this event and they all say the same thing they want to check us out and see what we are all about
64535 we had to prove ourselves in the past but we no longer have to prove ourselves
64536 weve proven we can play we can play on any playing field and beat anybody now we just need to maintain that high level of consistency and lets not forget we still have what we believe is the best basketball conference in the land
64537 michael was the first full time employee this conference hired in 1979 and as such hes been here from the start and nobody understands better what this league is about
64538 the next person will have to be someone who understands that delicate balance between basketball and football members and making sure the interests of both are served
64539 it has to be someone that understands who we are as a conference and where we are going
64540 there were basically two guys who deserve a lot of the credit for holding this conference together during the turmoil pitt chancellor mark nordenberg and michael tranghese
64541 michael is very even keeled he maintained a belief in a league he held dear to his heart he never panicked his leadership really is something we all take a cue from and while he held it together and rebuilt this thing it is up to the next guy to elevate it to the next level
64542 im not sure what ill do i guess ill be looking for a job if you know anyone who is hiring
64543 we buy more effeciently we create greater effeciencies in logistics we have several programmes in more effecient buying for example training programmes for employees to improve productivity so its a combination effort
64544 there is a sense of tremendous urgency to look at all categories all over again with a new look so we formed a core team a cross functional team and looking at whatever we can do in each categories one of the things are we are looking at substitutes very very seriously in some case we even found that the substitute was better than the original
64545 in an inflationary scenario maybe the consumers are willing to pay a higher price which covers your costs of operations but they need increased value alternatively you do some bit of challenge costing and ensure that for a given price level that you cant breach how do you make some amount of profit by pruning costs
64546 in the first case a 39 year old female taking 50mg a day of vitamin b6 for three months developed a feeling of burning pain and
64547 she was also taking a multivitamin product containing vitamin b6 and therefore her total daily dose most likely exceeded the upper level of intake of 50mg a day recommended by national guidelines
64548 all patients should be advised of the risks associated with excessive doses of vitamins
64549 there was a lot more of an emphasis on gameday calls
64550 usually we were seeing calls that dealt with the line of scrimmage whether it be off sides or formation misalignments
64551 i actually saw a defensive holding call today and thats something you dont see that was nice
64552 every time you see a flag thrown at your foot you want to know what you did as a prideful offensive lineman you dont think youre ever wrong so its nice to be able to correct yourself on the field at the time of the penalty
64553 he hadnt thrown a flag all day he wanted to get one out there
64554 the crazy thing was before the play i said to the ref watch me on this
64555 they were out there doing their jobs and making sure to keep the linemen right thats big because were practicing but we also have to play by the rules
64556 the competition doesnt change how i approach any situation this year or any other year
64557 its about me getting better the only thing i can worry about is how i play
64558 we never get to practice with the line like we did today
64559 you really never get to simulate the goal line like that
64560 its man against man so we just want to get the proper leverage and not let our man get underneath us
64561 the drill work helps you to stay down in your stance
64562 i didnt know he didnt even want me to take my hands off the ground that was a coaching point that will help me the next time we do goal line drills
64563 when we get down to the 3 yard line we want to be scoring every time you get riled up and its fun because you know theres going to be hard contact
64564 it was a good introduction for me to get some goal line work after a week of not practicing
64565 you really get to get those pads cracking and start hitting again
64566 i want the fans to see it and vote for me on the internet so i can be in the super bowl commercial
64567 it was a little intimidating but i had a lot of fun
64568 theres a big bright light in your face and its just you and the camera
64569 unfortunately i was out of football for a while so i hope the fans vote for me i would appreciate the votes very much
64570 we had a good morning practice were a little bit later only because we started later we met this morning but i thought we got work done today and it was a good practice this afternoon will be a special teams practice and then tomorrow will be back on a two a day
64571 its good competition thats going on as we said all along itll be a fair battle itll be a competition were not going to play favorites itll be won on the field today as you may have noticed shaun hill is resting his shoulder so since it was his turn to work with the first group thats why j t osullivan worked with the first group because if hes going to replace somebodys repetitions in fairness thats what you do and it is still wide open so theyre all competing but thats where its at
64572 the logic is this as ive said all along weve got three quarterbacks battling for the position three guys
64573 no hes been in it all along we did say that it would be difficult to get repetitions for the third guy and now that hes getting some repetitions were doing it in a fashion that keeps it fair i guess you could say that in all fairness if hes going to replace somebodys reps hell take those reps but as i said in the spring and ill continue to say it it is a battle between three guys if one guys getting less reps which is the case going into training camp that you foresee possibly happening again j t osullivan still has less reps but he had an opportunity to get some so he got them but this quarterback position is open theyre competing for it as i said all along
64574 its just a tired factor they threw a lot of balls those first few days so thats really all it is
64575 not really its production whoever gives us the best chance to win is the guy and weve got a lot of things to look at weve got practice to look at weve got history to look at weve got the preseason games its unfortunate that we dont have a regular season opportunity but obviously as we all know we want to be at our best we dont want to be trying to figure out who it is at that time again they still have to stay ready because i dont see any one of them taking every snap all season not because i hope it doesnt happen but only because thats the reality of the nfl typically
64576 he does know it and yes a year under his belt has helped him no question yesterday we went in and worked and today we worked in its evident that hes been in it because with the limited reps hes had so far if it was all new to him this year he wouldnt be where hes at so he is further ahead that is one of the reasons too we felt early in training camp in fairness to the other two guys we needed to get them up to speed because j t does have a year under his belt so for that reason we felt that that would be the best way
64577 i havent yet its part of the plan but just like i said the other day its not going to be this guy has this game and that guy has that game right now its going to be something where we have to get a good look at them and when it comes out in the game it might come out as one guy gets more reps with a certain group than another but you have to go in with a plan and if the plan stays as you foresee it being then things work out well but as we all know in the game sometimes youre three and out sometimes youre more than that a lot of things enter into it sometimes your defense is out there the entire first quarter and cant get off the field if that happens that steals from some of the reps that the quarterbacks get but well have a plan and work it out the best that we can
64578 i dont think thats because hes local youd have to ask him that question if thats something that he feels outside of that i see a guy thats bounced around the league a little bit thats played in the world league as have some other quarterbacks that have gone on to very good careers in the nfl i dont know if its a competitive level the things that stand out to me with him not getting reps or the few that he gets is theres no question to me that j t osullivan is tough hes competitive hes resilient now if he played the quarterback thatd be great so again with limited reps thats the one i cant really see but the other ones i can tell by the way he responds to the coaching and his teammates and also some history involved there
64579 i dont know yet well see i would hope it would be soon were just resting him its not that hes injured hes just resting
64580 its not at regular season yet are they ahead of the offense yes most of the players have been in this system at least a year the michael lewis and the nate clements and the patrick willis theyve been in a year those are some of the better players we have on defense justin smith looks like hes been in it for a year already but hes played a lot of football hes a very good football player some things just come naturally to him i would say theyre just further ahead in the scheme and thats why they look like they may be playing a little faster at times but i dont have the desire that it would be a lopsided team i would hope that our offense when the season begins whichever it takes for us to win whichever is truly more in comparison to your opponent than to yourself and thats what you see during the season because we no longer have these practices
64581 no what my desires are for whats good for us is that were good enough to win games early in the season as every team wants to be as you want to get better as the season goes along so that you peak at the end im not looking for the offense to be the very best at the beginning the better it is the better for us we need to be good enough to win early from there we just need to continue to get better there are no doubts that well continue to get better i believe staying healthy and barring any injury but where we start the season well find out we have a lot of work to do
64582 no question mike martz is calling the shots as far as putting it together and restructuring the offense isaac as youll notice out there is a quiet assassin hes very good in the back he talks to the guys but on a limited basis if a guy wants to learn he can go talk to isaac isaacs not going to hold back if somebody asks him i think hes just naturally a quiet person but he will help thats no question
64583 number one it brings playmaking and thats first and foremost outside of that he does bring a competitive level that should make the other guys better he also brings an expertise to the position that should make the other guys better because if they watch him hes a very disciplined player which is what mikes offense requires torry holt is the same way hes still at st louis obviously so those things he brings i also think he brings great character to our team and that just makes it all the better hes a quiet individual who doesnt say much but i love having him around and he seems like a very good person
64584 i like it with everything thats gone on as far as that goes i like it i like the defensive helmet having the mic in there i do like the force out because its more clear cut theres no gray area there get your feet in or youre out it also gives the defensive player the opportunity to make a good play he doesnt have to quit on something if his efforts make it so theres only one foot in then his efforts count and hes rewarded for them i think thats the way the game ought to be you shouldnt say all of a sudden well if that guy hadnt touched him hed have caught the ball then youre going to have a lot of completions because you know if someone had an interference oh id have caught that and then lets spot the ball here it is what it is you get knocked out youre either in the bounds or out and i think thats fair
64585 we really dont coach them any differently because we coach them all to finish every play and in finishing every play youll make every effort knock a guy out of bounds one of the problems if you want to call it a problem with the call was that there was a lot of difference of opinion as far as forced out or not so a lot of the guys that did knock guys out of bounds every now and then theyd get rewarded for saying he wouldnt have been inbounds anyway so the guys that we coach we say look knock them out anyway and put it on the official they might get it you might get a call thats in your favor if you never touched him you cant get any calls in your favor
64586 ill be perfectly honest with you i changed schools my junior year so i played very little my junior year my senior year i had an eye injury before the first game and hardly played at all when i went to college and played i walked on at oregon i had only played my freshman and sophomore year so id have to go back to then my best memory of high school football would have to be at bellarmine but what it was i couldnt say we had a lot of fun we were pretty good i played a lot then we had a good team when i went to woodside the one game that i played in my senior year before i got hurt we scrimmaged bellarmine and it was all my buddies who we played against and i remember our coach thought that they were too good for us to beat i remember thinking too good to beat these are my buddies man we can whip them i learned something from that thats a bad attitude every time you go on the field youve got to feel like you can win you dont just go out there and try to make it a good performance which is what he was talking about that didnt sit well with me they beat us not by much we played alright it was too much of that attitude just show up and do a good job well come out of here with no bumps and bruises
64587 we watch joe because at some point everybody starts to taper off but joe is such an all around player whether its his field goals or his leadership on the team or his knowledge of special teams that helps other guys or his surprise onsides joes really good the other kicker that we bring to camp in particular that kind of kicker the guy we have in camp here that does both weve got to know that the guy we have here if something happens to joe the other kicker can be ready i like the guy thats here he also punts very well hes got a strong leg that guys got an opportunity to build up some stock where if somebodys looking for another guy he may go to another team kicking is a funny thing guys bounce around a lot before they stick and most kickers its been that way theyre with a couple of teams and all of a sudden they learn how to do it its helpful for us because weve got to find that guy in case something happens to a guy i like the guy weve got hes got a strong leg he does both i dont just put it out of my mind and say were okay there you need to have your backup
64588 its very unusual joe is a good leader because hes played long enough for the league hes got a linebackers mentality hes very secure in what he does and hes very professional about his job and he approaches it that way so i think that joe feels that even when he does speak up hes got a right to speak because hes a professional at his job that gives him confidence but just joes personality alone allows for it as much as anything
64589 i didnt say that i said that j t has been in it but the question would have been well how could he have been at the beginning if he really wasnt getting any reps that would have been the question and legitimately so i said at that time you can only split it up so many ways that guy has to stay ready
64590 did you notice that the threw you in the garbage
64591 as you age and your communication skills develop the chances are that you will fall into the largest group of humans on this planet nice people with less than perfect communication skills
64592 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews

64596 i know that water pong seems like a good balance between the dartmouth drinking culture and just trying to have fun
64597 however it can be just as dangerous if not more so
64598 we never anticipated such a severe reaction to the word beer
64599 the troops were able to overrun and clear the encampment including retrieve an anti personnel landmine
64600 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
64601 i am going to china this time as the u s president who happens to be a sports fan
64602 in terms of foreign policy in the far east it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror
64603 our relations with your country thailand south korea with japan and china have never been stronger and it took a lot of work to get bilateral relations as strong as they are
64604 india and china and the us will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses throughout the region
64605 itll provide opportunities to work collaboratively on strong strategic areas security areas on the environment
64606 our vision is once that issue gets solved if north korea verifiably gives up its weapons programs ambitions then the six party talks can serve as another multilateral mechanism
64607 i will also remind people that i will be sprinting to the finish that i will finish this job strong
64608 i had a terrific time tune in and watch the show third week of october tentative broadcast date to find out what happened
64609 the first thing is that they all got through the game and that is very important considering the time some of them had been out of the game
64610 dempsey was very good his use of the ball when in posession was fantastic and he provided some good run for us hocking was alo very good but began to tire because of all the football he has missed
64611 hislop started a bit slowly but got better as the game went on and daniher got his hands to plenty of ball but was just missing his touch which he will pick up very quickly
64612 one aspect we look for is that they follow team structures at bendigo it is not about stats but sticking to the structures because if we dont it means they wont be getting their hands on it and not getting their touch back
64613 collingwood were more discsiplined than us bendigo bombers are a side that have to play their starting positions on a man and when we didnt do that collingwood were able to use their game structure and open up the game
64614 the crowd this week at frankston will be an important factor so we will have that to overcome but were a good side when we stick to our team structures and that needs to be our focus
64615 i waited 47 years to find a special woman and have found that in kristin
64616 i never knew that i could feel love on another level like this until i met her and i am now honored to call her my wife
64617 we arent clear what happened to dean davis but all the other homicides happened between people who knew each other
64618 the detective bureau has been very busy and fortunately very successful at solving the crimes hopefully they will be in the dean davis case

64631 i am here as a proud rep of my home town of vanadzor armenia i am also very proud to fight out of australia
64632 i am here to put on another exciting show for showtime i am going to fill up your highlight reel
64633 everyone at the emerald queen casino is going to hear my punches lefts and rights
64634 i dont care about his inactivity i know what i can do and i know how i can fight i know i will win this it is not a question in my mind him not having fought in a while does not play into this for me
64635 if i cant beat him then what am i doing with my career what am i doing i have to beat him for me this is do or die i have no choice
64636 for me this fight is like coming home i grew up on showtime that is where i got ranked that is where everything started for me i feel comfortable on showtime because it is home
64637 tomorrow night you will see the old ishe mixed with the new ishe i am just going to keep throwing the punches and you will notice my growth but you will still see the old ishe
64638 on paper this is my toughest fight we prepared though we watched a lot of tapes and i learned from them i really worked hard these past few fights and i am at my best i prepared
64639 every director in mumbai wants to work with mr bachchan at least once i also want to work with him but i dont have a script for him right now
64640 i feel the script is the backbone of the film if not a bound script one should have a very strong idea about the treatment of the film you have to keep working on it my script for john ash is ready but i will do two more drafts before it actually goes on the floor
64641 there are others but it depends on the subject i dont look at the actors first and then go for a script if a story suits shah rukh khan i would love to go and meet him and work with him otherwise i am okay with different casts i try for the best cast once the story is ready
64642 i have made two thrillers that doesnt mean i dont like other genres i want to do other genres this film has got shocks and surprises but it is not a thriller it is more of a personal story it doesnt have blood or guns
64643 it is not a romantic thriller and it is not a romantic comedy either it is a different kind of film i cant give you the plotline right now because it is too early the film will be released after a year or so i cant talk about it
64644 like my last two films this one is also set in mumbai and ramesh sippy is producing it as for the budget i dont know
64645 the confusion was because they had liked the basic storyline but i hadnt got the script ready even then they agreed to do the film i had dates of beginning of this year february march but couldnt use them because i hadnt finished the script by then
64646 so i pushed the project back now i have to wait for them to be free i dont know when i will start shooting the film
64647 im not casting aishwarya or john because they are big names
64648 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program
64649 i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions i am looking forward to putting this behind me and getting on the practice field with my teammates on saturday
64650 many players of race on his team hes not too high on it every player ive talked to doesnt like him hes not a well liked coach but i guess he has tenure so they never got rid of him theyre not successful at all
64651 we have about 190 people that rsvpd that they wanted to come
64652 we wanted to invite everybody thats helped us out this past year
64653 i just really thought there was no way i was going to be able to do it but really this first year has been a lot easier than i thought it was going to be
64654 they drink four bottles a day each still so thats 20 bottles a day id say we go through about 30 diapers a day
64655 louis farrakhan backs obama for president at nation of islam convention in chicago
64656 your jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in hell
64657 im planning on winning the brickyard in the 8 car
64658 weve got the stuff weve got the team the cars are awesome on flat tracks i have never planned on anything any more than my plan is for the brickyard thats the crown jewel
64659 and if you look at how that car ran at phoenix i believe that we can adapt that setup to work there the team is strong enough on pit road and crew chief tony gibson and those guys that work on that car are due a win
64660 they got several disappointments last year when they had great race cars and had failures and what have you nothing would make me happier than to see their faces in victory lane
64661 youre proud when you go back especially after the first win because i dont think we got to really enjoy the first win as much as we did the second year i think the first year is more of just a huge weight lifted off our shoulders that we accomplished a life long dream of ours and i think last year was a chance for us to really enjoy it with our team we were able to enjoy the win that night versus the emotional drain of just finally accomplishing a goal like it was the first time
64662 i havent fully been able to figure it out yet obviously last week we were on vacation and i did have my first team meeting with the guys at the shop you know it was just nice to get that first meeting out the way you know getting to see the faces that i am going to see a lot the rest of this year and a lot of next year i am not sure i fully understand what is holding them back right now i do think they have good resources and it is just a matter of figuring out where the break is in the system there you know there is obviously something that is not exactly the way we want it to be or they want it to be right now it is just going to take some more time i think being able to be at the shop the rest of the year will help with that i know that in the short amount of time since we have made the announcement at chicago we have had a lot of really good people call and want to be a part of this program and i think that is going to be a big key to getting it turned around
64663 i think it has taken a lot of the pressure off i mean obviously i have had a great race team and still have a great race team at gibbs right now you know we have battled a lot of adversity in the last nine and half years and you know when your guys dont know what you are going to do for sure and you dont know what you are going to do for sure it makes it a little bit tense but i think we have all made the most of it
64664 this issue is a result of the migration of javax
64665 this problem is fixed in weblogic server 9 2 mp1
64666 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
64667 obviously tyree washington and michael johnson played no part in the doping activities of others and it is a shame that they may suffer as a result
64668 once he made his mind up to attend a division ii school i think all his disappointment was over
64669 he had already lived through that hes very happy and content right now
64670 i think his sad period was wrestling with everything during the process once he made his mind up that this might not be working out real good for me he knew he had to go on and think about a division ii school
64671 he was respectful and called them and told them that he was going to valdosta they still wished him well
64672 theyre a wonderful school and wonderful coaches i could never say anything bad about carolina because they really did stick by dwight
64673 eventually all teams that upgrade to new engine packages will be subject to this rule modification
64674 over the years in our sport weve taken steps on numerous occasions to help maintain a level playing field among our competitors and we will continue to do so
64675 there is zero reason now for chevrolet to want to run the r07 on the nationwide tour we were mandated to bring this engine into nationwide we were told this is the menu you have to meet not a plus or minus and our engine is exactly to their specs
64676 fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
64677 this is of course a cat and mouse game but for the first time the cat will be at the same level as the mouse
64678 and i do hope the cat will be waiting for the mouse outside the hole
64679 they have given me an opportunity and i want to take advantage of it
64680 in this league its all about opportunity and being able to go through some growing pains and being able to do it on a consistent basis
64681 when i came here i was just looking to do what they asked and show them i could play
64682 i knew i could play this game i know what i went through in st louis but i always knew that i could play this game theres never been any doubt in my mind that i could play it might be a shock to other people but its not a shock to me
64683 its been hard work but ive stuck with it and continued to work ive gotten better every minute ive played in the league and im always striving to play better the next year
64684 he was a guy we picked up in free agency that came in and did a good job
64685 we were a little bit entrenched there with some guys we had but we always rotate our d line and a good rotation is real important he has played quite a bit for us he just didnt jog out in the starting lineup the majority of the time
64686 hes a guy who has been a starter in the league is capable of starting and we think he is good enough to start for us
64687 i liked the way the coaches dealt with players and the way the head coach interacts with players and the gm marty hurney how he interacts with everybody mr richardson owner jerry richardson will come down to the locker room and pull guys to the side and talk to them one on one
64688 you know i love jenks i think hes a great guy i still talk to him were still good friends he feels like he had the best thing happen to him going there and now i want to take advantage of this opportunity
64689 im really not looking at it like ooh im a starter
64690 coming out of spring practice we felt like wed have a chance to be decent one deep
64691 the big question we had was who are the backups going to be
64692 every year i think its a question mark for every team
64693 i think theres a definite difference between our starters and our backups
64694 ive got five right now that we feel good about and were just trying to find out where the backups are at
64695 they have another two or three months to mature more time in the weight room and they can kind of get more comforble with the plays we are running
64696 i think he has the ability a lot of those kids are considered true freshmen but its a little different when youve had a whole spring under your belt with ethan to go through 15 spring practices we kind of see joe looney a little differently than the rest of the incoming freshmen
64697 coach lobo in the spring we went on a little plan
64698 every day after practice we were doing extra work just to get our legs right and also lose a couple of pounds our offense were not sitting there powering people its all misdirection like anybody in the country knows youve got to be able to run be able to move be able to cut
64699 thats why he wants us all around the 290 285 300 range somewhere in there
64700 i didnt know what to expect actually but i think i came through it pretty good i have a good supporting cast and they guided me in the right direction they took care of me
64701 it feels great to be out there with the team and get back into the routine
64702 it feels great to be out there with the guys again
64703 jamelles ahead because hes played and been around and went through the spring so i think hes the no 1 guy
64704 then well go from there nobody has the starters jersey plastered on their back
64705 anybody can win the job hes starting off at the top of the heap right now but well see how it goes
64706 its been a long time this is the first time hes been on the field actually andre went through at least half of spring practice
64707 its been almost a year since toneys been on the field i thought he did well we stopped him about after 10 periods because we wanted to make sure we dont overdo it because we dont want to rush and have him do something that may injure him
64708 he was on track through the whole recovery situation certainly there may have been a setback here or there but nothing major
64709 we love defense as a team because we have a lot of guys who can get at it defensively cause some havoc and make a lot of plays
64710 he passed the ball well played great defense ran the lanes he played like lebron james
64711 the best was lebron james who made a big difference
64712 i think the first quarter was an adjustment period for us we were getting used to what they were running what their sets were
64713 the second quarter we did a much better job of locking in and taking those away
64714 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
64715 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
64716 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
64717 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
64718 its hard when youre working full time and it takes so much money to do it all so were just concentrating on the points on the southern tour and trying to pick out a couple of other races that pay good and try to have some fun with it as well
64719 ive always wanted to win one of the big races at the stadium and especially one of the tour races
64720 weve only had three of the tour races at the stadium plus ive always wanted my name in the record book beside dads hes one win up on me so id like to at least tie him
64721 its a blast running a modified car there if the right sponsor came along wed run there more on the points side of it it can be an eventful night you always worry a little bit about running the tour race there
64722 if you can start up front youve got a good chance of staying there
64723 aside from that its about being patient and waiting for the right moment you dont want to go do anything stupid over there to cost points but at the same time being a racer you go to win the race
64724 i want to try to figure out what i need to do there might be some kind of miracle a glimmer of hope what if i go out there to throw and dont feel anything for whatever reason if thats the case i wouldnt have the surgery
64725 if you just look at the mri the writings on the wall
64726 its tough weve been having to piece things together all year
64727 this is just another blow to us nobody expected it to happen i certainly didnt expect it its just been tough to deal with
64728 still when i do everyday stuff it doesnt really bother me
64729 the mri says one thing but i dont feel totally horrible as far as my arm goes
64730 i threw a pitch and it kind of felt weird
64731 i just kept on pitching and it started getting gradually worse instead of just hurting on my split finger i started to feel it on my cutters and fastball
64732 i can do everyday normal stuff i can pick up suitcases pick up all kinds of stuff and it doesnt really bother me
64733 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
64734 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
64735 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
64736 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
64737 we have a lot of faith in the guys we have
64738 we had conversations that went right down to the wire obviously when you have that you feel like you have a chance
64739 weve got a first place club weve played well but not as well as we can
64740 i feel we have the talent on hand to continue to do what we did the first two thirds of the season
64741 the rising tide of disbelief into which graham launched his crusades
64742 when we came back to the island we did not know much about the cowichan valley
64743 we were searching for a church family and found it at new life in a way that we had not before in other places where we lived there was an emphasis on reconciliation and creating understanding and the building of friendships to overcome the aboriginal non aboriginal divide
64744 churches and christian leaders in the community in many ways have been leading the way to create better relationships and to support successful delivery of the games
64745 edmonton amazed me and changed my life the power of the event the potential for social change i embraced it and became involved with the movement
64746 large and progressive thinking and a demonstrated potential for partnership
64747 those cultural programs bring artisans a marketplace and contemporary song and dance
64748 there is the sharing of songs dances and traditional practices of aboriginal people across north america these things offer the experience of lifetime and a better sense of direction
64749 true the indigenous games dont build highways and facilities they draw on what is already here and they build social legacies and reconciliation
64750 our view and mark buchanans and other christian leaders is that a 20 year relationship is growing out of it
64751 our elders have directed us to honour the creator every social event begins with prayer to the creator and god
64752 to continue to engage the chinese government on its human rights record in regard to freedom of religion when they travel to china
64753 olympic national teams have been denied the traditional practice of travelling with spiritual advisers from their own country
64754 chinese religious minorities have experienced extra persecution in the lead up to the games
64755 you dont have to live in fear of who you are
64756 any kind of publicity advertising displays banners slogans fliers brochures or samples
64757 thereby eliminating missionary activities in the year before the olympic games
64758 i guess its freedom of speech im sure people got pissed off but i dont think it was offensive i dont really think that jesus sucks
64759 you will not meet a young muslim man in the world who is not angry about something anyone who watches the news if he wasnt mad then a theres something wrong with him or b hes ignorant
64760 erm yes whipped cream on both and a sprinke of cinnamon on one please
64761 the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from its government
64762 it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg
64763 if i could write like this i would be a happy man
64764 his european perspective on american liberty often catches me off guard but i am never sorry when i read his site
64765 mercilessly skewers the idiocy of the nanny state with a wry sense of humor that makes it a daily must read
64766 not this moment my friend in the name of feeling anything not this moment
64767 it was really cute first heather proposed to carolyn then carolyn proposed to her
64768 what i do you have to see it to believe it even exists
64769 remove this notion that the international community opposes the nuclear activities of iran
64770 strong positive signal that the only way is negotiation and dialogue
64771 reaffirmed the basic and inalienable right of all states to develop research production and use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes
64772 we are not giving up our nuclear activities including enrichment
64773 they have come to the end of their power and the world is on the verge of entering a new promising era

64776 activisions june quarter stand alone results were the highest ever for a non holiday quarter driven by two new guitar hero titles guitar hero aerosmith and guitar hero on tour kung fu panda and continued sales of our catalogue titles
64777 our record performance highlights the continued strength of our business we are well positioned to continue to capitalise on our strong product portfolio and the positive trends in our industry
64778 we are very excited to add vivendi games multi million unit selling properties crash bandicoot ice age and spyro as well as two new intellectual properties prototype and an as yet unannounced title to our game roster
64779 the combination with vivendi games strengthens our holiday slate which is already anchored by three of the top selling franchises in the industry guitar hero call of duty james bond and includes such highly anticipated games as call of duty world at war guitar hero world tour and quantum of solace as well as crash bandicoot mind over mutant and the legend of spyro dawn of the dragon
64780 were big fans of gamesindustry biz by some measure its the best games trade site out there and im including the us ones too its a true must read site and several times a day at that the team have done a great job building it to such a position of strength
64781 one if i lose im gonna beat that ass two if i lose im gonna beat that ass
64782 apparently insulting an aussies manhood is a more effective way to shame him into slowing down than images of death and dismemberment
64783 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways
64784 everybody wants to see me out there the coaches want to see me out there my family and friends want to see me out there i want to see me out there its a great opportunity for me
64785 i dont think so i think its a year for me to step up and start over again
64786 once i get out there and show everyone what i can do there wont be any more problems
64787 you can have the best guy in the world out there and if he doesnt get the ball no one will know about him
64788 coming in and not having the anxiety of not being a rookie and knowing what to expect helps a lot
64789 i know a lot more of the defense better im able to work at a faster pace
64790 i like the fact that here they treat you like men
64791 they expect you to come in and do your job you know whats expected of you get it done and theres no problems you dont get it done then theres a problem im trying to get it done
64792 introduce an implicit revolt against the institution of marriage into its very heart further promoting the democratization and secularization of personal and sexual life
64793 people who have devoted much of their professional lives to attacking marriage as an institution almost always favor gay marriage
64794 precisely in the hope of dethroning once and for all the traditional conjugal institution
64795 see even supporters of gay marriage admit theyre destroying marriage with this reform weve exposed their real agenda
64796 if the laws change tomorrow and lesbians and gay men were allowed to marry
64797 where would we find the incentive to continue the progressive movement we have started that is pushing for societal and legal recognition of all kinds of family relationships
64798 the simple fact remains that the fight for marriage equality is at its essence not a progressive fight but rather a deeply conservative one that seeks to maintain the social norm of the two partnered relationship with or without children as more valuable than any other relational configuration
64799 because of their unwillingness to be a part of the solution and knowing that i am duty bound both constitutionally and by statute to balance the budget i am forced to take immediate and unilateral actions to fulfill my responsibilities
64800 while we want to have a contract that is fair to rhode island taxpayers and some of the lowest paid state employees council 94 will not be bullied coerced or intimidated
64801 the executive order is still a huge violation of contract law
64802 taking terms not agreed upon and unilaterally trying to impose them on people who have not voted for a contract is a way of trying to stuff it down their throats
64803 even if a deal gets rejected you normally go back to the bargaining table
64804 the only way to get an agreement is if they sit down and talk
64805 watkins glen and bristol are two tracks where i really want a win
64806 i enjoy racing on the road course at watkins glen and for some reason always seem to be a little better there than sonoma weve had some top fives so hopefully this will put us in the win column
64807 as for the trucks i am really looking forward to that i have never run a truck race so it should be fun heck my brother jarit has run more than me but its going to be a good time
64808 the last couple of races the car has been the best it has ever been id like to continue with the momentum i have for sure
64809 the cars the best its been this year so it would be nice to score points this weekend and thats our aim
64810 it will be hot and tiring too so keeping your focus and concentration will be vital
64811 its not nice when its not going so well but its not the first time
64812 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
64813 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
64814 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
64815 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
64816 ive won big races before but this one has some extra special meaning because this place is so close to pittsburgh its cool to finally win a big race out in this area
64817 the only thing that couldve topped off tonight was if somehow troy polamalu was here to present me the trophy

64820 this will allow us to continue our transition to new media while further controlling the rapidly rising costs of newsprint and transportation both of which have increased more than 30 percent in the past year
64821 this decision to move to a five day print newspaper was a difficult one for me and for our colleagues at the new york times co but we believe it is a necessary one and not unlike changes that all newspapers and media companies are currently experiencing

64825 mitigate the effects of the advertising downturn and to manage its balance sheet conservatively and these are key factors in moodys affirmation of the existing ratings
64826 theres carnage in the newsrooms overseas particularly in the states where some five thousand people have lost their jobs this year alone
64827 theres also been a massive reduction in reporting on foreign news and certain categories of news
64828 cost cutting alone is not a good enough strategy while locally we are seeing investigative journalism taking a back seat in the us cost cutting is not affecting investigative journalism which is seen as a unique benefit instead certain categories of jobs are being cut were seeing photographers and subs leaving newsrooms while more shrewd newspapers are reinvesting the wall street journal is investing in online subs online video and other web skills

64831 de schoonouders reden in de auto achter het gezin en hebben alles zien gebeuren
64832 het zijn mooie tegenstanders maar ik denk dat ze nog een beetje te vroeg komen
64833 de competities in engeland en duitsland beginnen al over twee weken en de eredivisie pas over vier weken het is dus logisch dat die ploegen verder zijn bovendien heb ik door blessures maar een smalle selectie tot mijn beschikking maar goed deze datum was al ver van tevoren gepland dus daar moeten we niet over klagen we hebben deze week bewust gas teruggenomen want de spelers moeten niet zoals tegen fc dordrecht vermoeid aan de aftrap staan we willen ons zo goed mogelijk presenteren aan het publiek we zullen wel zien wat het wordt

64883 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
64884 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
64885 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done
64886 that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
64887 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars

64892 way back when when the algae were responsible for creating the long chain hydrocarbons like diesels and heavy oils the biomass just got buried and compressed and formed crude oil
64893 id say its a very sound idea but the question is are they able to do anything practical in an efficient way the key questions are the efficiency with which this process happens
64894 they also have the classic renewables problem in that youre dealing with the ultimate energy source the sun which is quite diffuse so youre only getting in peak conditions around 0 5kw per square metre you need vast great big farms
64895 i dont view the diplomacy as zero sum its got to be either this country or that country india and china and the united states will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs businesses throughout the region and theyll provide great opportunities for development of services and goods that people in our big markets want

64897 collaboratively on strong strategic areas security areas one area will be theres a great opportunity for all of us to cooperate on the environment
64898 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
64899 cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
64900 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
64901 measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies

64907 theres so much they can do with the story thats one of the things that makes it stay interesting
64908 they brought out a line of books that was pretty lame so i stopped buying those
64909 id always loved stars wars and after my wife passed away 15 years ago i threw myself into it and the community became my family i meet some of my best friends at these events i have a day job and a mortgage and car but this is my real life i couldnt say what id do if i didnt have star wars and the community
64910 people will tell you how much star wars means to them fan culture is all sorts of things it can be geeks in costumes who havent showered for two weeks or ordinary looking people who received their love of star wars from their parents and have in turn passed it on to their children
64911 the live action movies were really centred on the skywalker family and weve never gotten to see the full breadth of the conflict
64912 we grew up with star wars we really believe in it
64913 you have to handle fans as a fellow fan and you cant talk down to them fans are smart if they smell bullshit theyre not going to jump into it
64914 you have to be careful because theres unruly people out there
64915 the fact i had never come across honour killings before i came to england and i grew up in dubai is quite telling

64922 you understand the conflict between being a dutiful daughter and doing your own thing

64925 and thats across all the cultures and all the skin colours

64933 extended stay hotels offer flexibility to those clients who may require accommodations for greater than the 14 days allowed in the tourist hotel and would like the full amenities provided in a home but do not wish to enter into long term lease agreements in the rental housing market due to the limited duration of their stay

64935 one to be used designed or intended to be used for a period of 14 consecutive days or more

64954 im a summer camp counselor with the university ymca and every time that were riding a bus together with the kids these kids are going into fifth through seventh grade they get scared when we go across bridges some of them close their eyes or they tell me that they dont like bridges or they dont like to look out the window and a lot of that has to stem from the bridge collapse
64955 we do have confidence in our inspection program in our thoroughness for our inspection program
64956 a bridge can be classified as structurally deficient if there is some sprawling in the deck some potholes in the deck or some rust on the steel members of the bridge
64957 people would think ok its structurally deficient you should immediately start getting that replaced and a lot of times there is much life left in those bridges
64958 we might not be the most visible people but we are out there and this is a very important job to ensure the safety of the traveling public
64959 tonight lets keep our mouths shut and just play the game
64960 hey i wasnt the one who went off last time

64963 we all wanted him to come home just not in a casket
64964 it was a 14 month struggle trying to get information it hurts to only get the horrible news that alex was gone
64965 the loss of a son is never easy especially one whos so good
64966 i love the sound of the human voice and listening to languages that i dont speak the way people talk their rhythm tells a story
64967 people are thrilled to see their language represented and are equally disappointed when they cant find it

64972 google has long invested in promising start ups so the news that the company was thinking about formalizing those efforts by creating a venture capital arm reported in the wall street journal thursday was hardly surprising a person familiar with googles plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss them confirmed that the company had hired william maris a 33 year old former entrepreneur and investor to explore the idea of a venture arm but the person said that at this point the effort is embryonic at best there is no structure no organization and no capital assigned to the project and it is possible that mr maris will end up working on other projects

64988 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
64989 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us

64991 liberia is in a state of economic and social emergency
64992 i really wanted my life to count for something for god

64994 upgrading the competency of local doctors is probably a more effective way of upgrading health care than trying to build or manage clinics
64995 it would be first thing in the morning and a rebel would say i want to kill somebody i havent killed anybody yet today and he would just shoot one of us
64996 its very eye opening to me that they destroyed so much thats good its hard to get my brain around why they destroyed schools hospitals and medical clinics
64997 i am in a position to do something now to use the passion in my heart to help

65014 aboriginal women experience higher rates of violence if that burden is going to be lifted the socioeconomic conditions and prosperity gap between aboriginals and non aboriginals will have to be addressed
65015 in order to make aboriginal womens lives safe and secure the conservative government must implement measures to address its root causes such as poverty

65048 the big surprise from these new results is how pervasive and long lasting mars water was and how diverse the wet environments were
65049 in most locations the rocks are lightly altered by liquid water but in a few locations they have been so altered that a great deal of water must have flushed though the rocks and soil
65050 this is really exciting because were finding dozens of sites where future missions can land to understand if mars was ever habitable and if so to look for signs of past life
65051 water must have been creating minerals at depth to get the signatures we see
65052 it wasnt this hot boiling cauldron it was a benign water rich environment for a long period of time
65053 not only was water active in this region to weather the rocks but there was enough of it to run through the beds transport the clays and run into the lake and form the delta

65064 the stone used in the foundations a lot of the buildings in indiana rest upon came from that quarry
65065 at first it was why dont we do a show this summer

65097 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
65098 he left pittsburgh a long time ago to change his life around and to get a fresh start now hes gone
65099 he loved children he always liked to laugh and joke now somebody maliciously and viciously killed him
65100 this is getting too close to home this is crazy its open season if you want to do all this killing get on a plane and fly to iraq and you can shoot people all day long
65101 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
65102 i understand why the senator would like to have this matter commenced and concluded before the elections and by all indications that is possible
65103 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
65104 if i knew i may have lobbied to get a motion to table it the pay raise because of the cost and lack of information i would have researched it a little deeper and talked with the chief
65105 he is a police officer with a lot of experience
65106 he did a good job with the borough council accepted his retirement and threw in a couple little things as he went out the door
65107 when and if he shall be requested to provide the same by council
65108 he has worked for more than 30 years as a police officer and chief
65109 its good for the community to keep an association with chief kelly for at least a few years
65110 were in the midst of our annual convention which started monday and concludes sunday
65111 we had 560 000 people for our weeklong convention last year most of them are members but you dont have to be a member to attend
65112 the high end of the home built aircraft scale in terms of speed and expense
65113 this is the most complex political campaign that the community will ever see
65114 so we created an ad about how the merger would create jobs that would keep their children and grandchildren in louisville
65115 clearly in order to be successful youre going to have to educate the voters
65116 i dont think it could be successful without a campaign like that people need to know what theyre voting for
65117 its pointless really even to have the discussion without it harrisburgs gotta act
65118 thats how i believe they can build good faith with the legislature that theyre serious about this matter
65119 there needs to be a followup commission or report to iron out the excruciating details
65120 that is a civic responsibility to do it in a transparent and civically involved manner as opposed to jumping right into a sales campaign
65121 now were paying 2008 prices and its costing 12 million more
65122 it sounds kind of mundane but its really interesting finding out who did what and when
65123 this is an opportunity for learning and an opportunity for partnering
65124 im going to get him out as soon as i can
65125 we kind of get what we want and he gets what i think he wants
65126 there are a lot of vacant lots that are overgrown and an eyesore to the community
65127 until the area is developed nothing will work better to improve the corridor than demolition followed by parking
65128 development will come if we can show that the unsavory street element can no longer flourish here parking is a great temporary answer and a proper interim activity
65129 there is a lot of construction going on around there
65130 its a real loss to see it gone its a symbol of disrespect for history
65131 it looks like theyve set up for longer than a weekend
65132 since we have no facilities on the islands we like to keep track of who is there
65133 i think when you look historically the region probably under invested in bridges
65134 now were trying to get that investment level back up and were spending a good amount of money on bridges
65135 pennsylvania has the most structurally deficient bridges anywhere in the country
65136 the average age of a bridge here is about 50 years old
65137 we have serious concerns about their long term ability to provide a quality living site for people
65138 its our intention for them to close and not provide care at all
65139 its very devastating because it puts stresses on many people
65140 it uproots so many peoples lives it snowballs and it affects everyone
65141 weve never had this happen in 22 years of business
65142 if we dont know it happened we cant do anything
65143 audrey and i would go to the various hotels in the city and pick up their used bedsheets
65144 the ladies would cut them stitch two of them together and then stuff the bed pads once they were completed wed deliver them the ladies continued to make them until more modern methods were used to create bed pads
65145 my mother was a woman of compassion who looked for ways to make life easier especially for those confined to beds in nursing homes
65146 on the days she needed additional help the call would come and i was gone
65147 that it was hard to keep my husband from raiding our childrens holiday baskets that were filled with her chocolates
65148 its sporadic but it seems to be more prevalent in the more rural areas
65149 two or three years ago this wasnt even on the radar
65150 its because 1 2 billion people in china want to live like we do
65151 export has gone through the roof because american scrap is more on sale due to the weak dollar
65152 its definitely an advantage im able to see what is happening in other counties and it will be a benefit to see what is working in other counties
65153 were looking at that now so i want to see how it will help westmoreland county
65154 this is my county so i would like to see anything implemented here that will help the system
65155 although there are no guarantees right now it does look favorable
65156 export because of the mines was the center of the valley until world war ii
65157 sending packages to their relatives who were suffering in europe
65158 this community can really take credit for the fact that it has a true downtown area
65159 stir up more interest in the downtown area of export
65160 i dont know why the post office didnt start looking for another facility then
65161 it was a great place to work with great employees and exceptional clerks
65162 its not going to be the post office that we know
65163 i remember once i think it was in portland where my youngest cori had an ear infection and a fever of about 104
65164 so i took her to an emergency room about midnight and got back from the emergency room about 7 30am that morning i had a 9 20am tee time
65165 annika wants a family and she doesnt think she can have a family and play the quality of golf shes used to
65166 it was hard for me to play having young kids out here so i can see where shes coming from
65167 i plan to finish out this year and then re evaluate but im close to giving it up
65168 i dont think annika could come back out here and finish 12th on the money list and live with herself
65169 i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
65170 i dont know what to do i cant post something low it seems like i cant play 18 holes
65171 a wind turbine can be seen you cant hide it
65172 three and a half miles is a great distance of that ridge and it impacts every resident of fayette county thats what makes this case unusual they cant mitigate the effect of those turbines on that ridge
65173 whether we realize it or not most of us that have grown up here take that ridge that we affectionately call the mountain for granted
65174 but there is a quality of life thats provided by that view shed
65175 what happened here is the zoning hearing board substituted their judgment for that of the governing body to find that windmills should not be on chestnut ridge
65176 lots of people waive things that arent good for them they do it because theres money involved
65177 most people arent real warm and fuzzy about bats but bats are an important part of our ecosystem
65178 bats are really good at eating insects thats their job
65179 you cant put them near people they need to be at least a mile away
65180 i love the fact that its the kids showing their exhibits to the other kids weve never done anything like that before
65181 shes played with them since she was old enough to pick up a bug
65182 i like to be out at lakes and just enjoy the scenery
65183 two years after graduating i was pursuing my business plan
65184 i let the guy know the starbucks manager that i was planning to open my shop
65185 they can expect their drinks within two minutes of when they place their order
65186 i owe a lot to nctc for the opportunity that they provided us to start a business
65187 dr lee ann nutt when she hired us she was doing us a big favor i had no credentials no background
65188 he was able to create a coffee shop atmosphere first with coffee and hot teas
65189 i think it is exciting to be able to renovate make it our own
65190 its been the biggest adventure of my life to see our vision become one
65191 when we lived together he had the idea for a coffee shop
65192 there are a lot of wonderful venues in denton with live music and i am really impressed with who they are bringing in
65193 i would like the hydrant cafe to be able to offer more of a venue of the raw student type musician in the unt jazz program
65194 one of the original fire stations was out that way
65195 advertising murals on buildings were very common in the days before billboards
65196 we want to be a place where people can get a good bite and have a really good drink
65197 at first i waited to see whether fellow council member alan fletcher would announce
65198 with the may election you might be thinking about it in january but you arent doing anything
65199 grand jury findings did not contain any information that bill knew about the behavior
65200 theres nothing ive seen tying him to the criminal activity but the criminal activity took place under his nose
65201 he believes that leaders who become mired in administrative details paralyze an organization
65202 we dont know whether hell be indicted or escape prosecution all of this is to make a case to win the election and maintain power
65203 i believe my behavior has been honorable and appropriate im confident authorities will view it in the same vein
65204 the ioc would like to stress that no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into
65205 when she received compensation in excess of amounts approved by the authority
65206 arrow accepted checks for attendance at meetings for which she was not present
65207 quite frankly she was not a decision maker in this process its not fair to say she because everybody was receiving pay for meetings at the time that they thought was appropriate
65208 based on the information at the time she thought it was the right thing to do
65209 this is a grand jury investigation the grand jury recommended that the attorney general file charges against representative ramaley and the other 11 defendants
65210 the charges are detailed in the grand jury presentment and additional evidence will come out on oct 7 at ramaleys preliminary hearing in harrisburg
65211 im the best man for the job and my numbers in the primary validate that
65212 the other candidates ive seen so far are all veon or sen gerald lavalle loyalists im not sure any of them can win in this district
65213 ive had a number of people call me about this and ask me to run
65214 while the new castle police department takes these matters seriously we must reserve comment at this time pending the outcome of the court process
65215 so it might be a little more than day to day at this point
65216 however the likelihood increases proportionately as the degree of perceived threat or the potential for a public disturbance increases
65217 tsa consistently reminds passengers that joking about bombs is not a laughing matter
65218 other people had been telling him but when his teacher said it we took it seriously
65219 we were really excited that he made it that far
65220 the pirates are the team that really made out well here it cost the red sox 7 million hansen and moss just to be able to trade manny ramirez for jason bay it was the only way to get ramirez out of town
65221 i think the pirates did pretty well i think the dodgers did pretty well and i think the red sox ended up getting the least of the deal the pirates made out pretty well for themselves
65222 the only real concern the red sox should have in jason bay is that he spent most of his career in the national league and we know the national league right now is inferior to the american league he hasnt faced as much high quality pitching in any kind of games in the national league that he will see in the american league but having seen a fair amount of jason bay he has the bat speed and pitch recognition to be able to handle the transition
65223 as long as i stay competitive and stay progressive and dont get injured or anything like that im pretty sure im going to be on the team just because they already know what i can do
65224 needed a guy in that capacity to add some competition
65225 i called the water company we cant do anything this was going to be my laundry day
65226 the fire chief told me at about 8 a m we didnt have any water but around quarter after it was back on
65227 the water company bypassed the water break so we had service
65228 i think we need to look at one project and finish it
65229 the general consensus was they want to see us do a project and do it complete do it right not band aid
65230 unfortunately the last time we tried to do wendover the bids came in significantly over the budget
65231 rather than piece meal and do some things at some buildings we think it might be better to address the needs of one building and do a complete project
65232 the fact we dont have to put additions on it stanwood makes all the difference in the world in costs
65233 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
65234 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
65235 ive always been one to follow my gut and follow my heart with decisions and when ive done that things have worked out pretty darn good for me
65236 my gut was telling me that this wasnt the right situation
65237 they collect items for newborns and a lot of their newborns are premies who need help such as clothing and blankets
65238 i actually saw some of the blankets that were handed out while we were in the nicu which was kind of a neat thing
65239 we thought it was ironic that cindy was the promoter of this whole mission for premature babies and needy babies and then whenever she was fortunate to get her child he had special needs too
65240 there is just a special part in my heart for a baby that is in need
65241 if we can help a struggling baby or a struggling mom its a blessing to be able to have the opportunity
65242 were asking that they dont wrap them because we will give them to leticia that night
65243 nationally what were striving for is name recognition and donations
65244 when your baby has been that sick and that tiny its huge
65245 providing complete layettes for infant demise is our saddest task but we acknowledge each life that touches our hearts
65246 memorial items such as teddy bears and keepsake envelopes are provided to the family to have something to keep close by to honor the life that was gone too soon
65247 im just here to help any way i can i felt like a rookie actually they gave me the playbook today and the next thing you know i was out there with the first team
65248 john would have been a good fit for us but it wasnt a good fit for him right now
65249 he must have been bending his legs he moved around pretty well were fortunate to have him in here
65250 youve got to find the right guy in the right circumstances to bring him in
65251 weve got a tentative timetable but id rather leave that to samari right now
65252 you never know whether it will become chronic or not
65253 hell do everything he can to play on sunday im looking forward to him rehabbing and being back for that dallas game
65254 orr shows up every day in practice making a play doing something
65255 hes shown up rushing the passer some as an inside linebacker as an outside linebacker he does have some versatility which is good
65256 in order to be economically competitive we must have a reliable supply of electricity and there is no more reliable source of electricity than coal
65257 coal is affordable and available right here in the united states of america
65258 we need to send a signal to the world that the u s has an aggressive policy
65259 its in our national security interests to get our own oil
65260 nuclear power is a zero emission fuel but its hard to get a plant built because of excessive regulations and lawsuits
65261 basically all it says is were getting back to work
65262 we have made an arrangement with the contractors that eventually were going to go back to travelers and try to get our money back
65263 if i can see better i know i can catch better
65264 the last thing he clicked i could see perfect clear
65265 i wish we would have found out earlier because we need to get those drops down
65266 i think its good for jason to go to a team that could be a contender and utilize his bat and his defense thats best for him
65267 the pirates are going to lose out on a good player but it seems every year were rebuilding so we have to trade away our good talent and hopefully get some good prospects
65268 you cant keep letting all your stars go thats not good
65269 i was hoping they were going to keep jason bay i liked him
65270 you want people to come out and watch the games
65271 you keep letting your big home run hitters go and its chasing people away from the park instead of to the park
65272 id rather trade him and get something out of the deal
65273 i mean i liked him but everyones expendable if were not winning we might as well try something different
65274 i have been coming to the italian festival for 25 years now and i look forward to it every year
65275 we went to italy several years ago and wish we could go back
65276 he columba left successors distinguished for great charity divine love and strict attention to the rules of discipline following indeed uncertain cycles as in the computation of the great festival of easter because far away as they were out of the world no one had supplied them with the relative synodal decrees
65277 to me vocatum is a place where the name of jesus is highly and consistently exalted and where we find our calling in the shadow of the cross
65278 i think he felt he was defending a womans integrity
65279 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
65280 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
65281 ghosts among us uncovering the truth about the other side
65282 over in the wps op ed page david ignatius tells of his one on one interview with president bush where the two talked about iran
65283 in his column charles krauthammer analyzes one of bushs public statements which leads him to state the signal is unmistakable

65286 the whole project was just stopped end of discussion he said
65287 it appears that it was michael powell not the public who preferred to make decisions based on personal ideology
65288 but you can go too far and i dont plan to do that
65289 if this draft legislation were passed in its present form the director of the central intelligence agency has told me that he did not believe that the interrogation program could go forward
65290 together with elvis and johnny cash wills is in both the country music and rock n roll halls of fame
65291 there was a connection between the events of september 11 2001 and iraq
65292 let me just first tell you that ive never been more convinced that the decisions i made are the right decisions
65293 if it was anyone else wed be stringing them up by their neck but no its bobby dee and the folk process
65294 who cares what you think punk you dont even have a name
65295 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement
65296 was inspired by partisan divisions inside the broadcasting board of governors
65297 to resist economic pressures to make additional cuts which could remove it from the top ranks of american journalism
65298 but as a community voice in the metropolitan region the los angeles times is irreplaceable
65299 so good to see you ive heard about your good news congratulations
65300 that little nerd is going to be controlling hundreds of thousands of dollars in awards
65301 thats why one must always be hospitable to everyone even little nerds
65302 im just happy to have this chance to do something for jewish culture for the culture as a whole really
65303 i guess ill have to stop making fun of your eating habits
65304 can we guess and youll tell us if were right or wrong
65305 if youre giving out two prizes theyre going to bellow and roth three then its bellow and roth and ozick
65306 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
65307 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
65308 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
65309 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
65310 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever
65311 i have tried to be careful never to say the risen book was irrelevant ive said it was a factor in reopening the discussion
65312 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people
65313 i couldnt imagine somebody like osama bin laden understanding the joy of channukah
65314 leftists excoriated susan sontag for implying that the assault was payback for americas crimes

65320 the great red zone that voted for bush is clearly ready for war the decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead and may well mount a fifth column
65321 so what you are telling me is that since you do not have the time to properly tune and configure your existing detection technology you think that the smart move is to put in another layer of nearly identical technology that actually blocks traffic
65322 obviously sidney crosby and other young players you put into the system are going right into the nhl so its a lot easier to have that dramatic turnaround
65323 in baseball its not quite that easy thats where depth becomes important you have to have multiple options and cant be relying on just one or two key pieces
65324 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program
65325 i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family
65326 i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions i am looking forward to putting this behind me and getting on the practice field with my teammates on saturday
65327 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
65328 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal which really hurts me to say that i have to miss the olympics
65329 im currently packing up really quick to hop on the plane and head to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let all of you know first that theres no chance of me competing in beijing the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
65330 according to their latest results they were considered to be real contenders for olympic medals including gold
65331 this is of course a cat and mouse game but for the first time the cat will be at the same level as the mouse
65332 and i do hope the cat will be waiting for the mouse outside the hole
65333 most secure place in beijing at the time of the games
65334 i was the only guy until we got back to ohio and there i had a guy meet us in zanesville
65335 he took over for a couple nights and i was able to get some sleep we have the north south in florence ky coming up and i think we are going to take some time off before that we really need to rebuild everything right now
65336 we might pick something before the north south race we had three guys in the shop fixing all of their stuff because they are all tore up right now we are just going to take it easy
65337 with the season winding down were quickly running out of options
65338 we thought about labor day weekend but theres just too much going on in the region the september 5 weekend is pretty open as there arent any races for the sprints or modifieds in the region and the mod lites dont race anywhere on friday so this will give fans and racers the opportunity for racing
65339 it has been inconsistency with the handling and we havent gotten the whole combination together at one time
65340 it is a 2006 car it was new last august and weve won seven eight or 10 races with it last saturday july 19 we hit the combination at sharon speedway and we won so maybe its coming around now
65341 recently we have been running better at sharon than anywhere else
65342 i am not sure why because it just doesnt make sense chad reitz has been my crew chief since before i got hurt and that is what is so puzzling about this neither of us can get a handle on it
65343 i have been down this road many times so we are not going to panic about it
65344 im sure there are some people who wonder if bob can still drive a car i think when the car is right i am as good as anyone around here now i am not saying that i am as good as steve kinser or donny schatz but i can certainly drive with ed lynch jr rod george kevin schaeffer jack sodeman jr and others
65345 it gets frustrating because we really started off the year very well and then i think we had four second place finishes in a row
65346 i know we were really good the night mark smith won may 9 at lernerville and im not saying we should have won but i think we could have
65347 the motor that i dont like is older but in some ways it is better than the newer one which is getting hot my high horsepower engine is not the one i needed for the silver cup it has too much
65348 im going to try to finish out the year at sharon speedway and at lernerville
65349 sure i would like to win another championship but i really dont want to get tied up in it i just want to go race and relax you go pull the pill and see what happens after that
65350 i definitely want to do some traveling after the season is done around here
65351 id say i want to go to williams grove and to hagerstown i think we are going to blow off knoxville this year because i dont really want to go there with just one engine
65352 tomb of forbidden cliches played out sight gags and inappropriate football metaphors
65353 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
65354 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
65355 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
65356 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
65357 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
65358 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
65359 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
65360 i dont know if we were going to move him up or down but well start there
65361 but you cant let that stuff get to your head
65362 if i come out this year and dont perform to the level i did last year people will say oh hes a one year wonder
65363 i just use it as motivation i like when people doubt me when they say i cant do it again i say watch out i think i can do even better than last year
65364 ill be the first one to admit it im not ashamed
65365 i had no idea because he never played we had no tape of scott he had a good spring going into his junior year but i felt like he would be a very good player for us he exceeded all expectations now hes got to prove that that was not a fluke that that was real
65366 what i developed with coach rhoads was studying the offensive coordinator knowing what he wants to do and learning his tendencies
65367 i watch the offensive line and read run or pass i watch the running back whether he likes to bounce or keep it north south
65368 all of those things are part of becoming a better linebacker plus theres the experience not looking nervous in a way our practices were so hard that our games were less intense
65369 uyyyy la puta no tengo ni idea en donde mierda estar
65370 the site is designed to offer useful information to those researching our legal services
65371 however we also want to provide a valuable resource for our clients

65373 weve been on the other side the last couple years
65374 after watching these kids experience disappointment at the legion and high school level i am so happy for them
65375 this is a great bunch of kids they gave a great effort

65377 i wanted six innings out of him and he gave me nine
65378 the curve ball was on and it was all about placement today

65382 and designers are getting more and more creative with bows we see them on so many things including handbags and ive even see handbags in the shape of a bow
65383 when a woman wears lace or a bow under a leather jacket it gives a little bit of an edge to the look
65384 i have seen a well executed bow in the back or on the shoulder of a dress which looks great
65385 tailored dresses are a key trend for the fall season and the addition of a bow softens the look and adds a touch of femininity
65386 yeah that knife grinder guy does he come around often

65389 i think that a couple episodes strayed a little bit too far away from where i think our sort of sweet spot is
65390 so we made a concerted effort i think this season to bring us back to the lighter side of eureka and especially restoring some of the relationships that we were missing a little bit in season two
65391 i guess you can say its been a lifetime of preparation i suppose and im very excited about the opportunity
65392 im very honored and proud of that fact and i hope to demonstrate success in filling that role
65393 in our back to school consumer survey a couple weeks ago 61 percent of those surveyed said they believe were in a recession that says it all
65394 some people will continue shopping at the same places but will just buy less while others will go to lower price stores
65395 oil prices tight credit mortgage woes job security all play on consumers psyches
65396 in our latest consumer survey low price has become the determinant for where people are shopping over things such as quality and service
65397 the economic slowdown is affecting everyone because consumers are spending more for necessities oil and food and have less money to spend on other things like retail
65398 across the country it has been one of the worst spring seasons we have ever seen
65399 consumers have really pulled back on their spending the middle american consumer is hurting so we are hurting
65400 there was easy money out there very willing lenders ready to make loans to retailers

65407 the challenge for the movies is that politics have been so entertaining all year long that if a movie isnt good it will pale by comparison
65408 he basically says that voting doesnt count for a damned thing its just a way to make you feel important
65409 the thing about oliver stone is when hes making great films he holds up a mirror to the american conscience
65410 our ego has gotten us into all our trouble our fatness so to speak our inability to look to the future and see where were headed and change the direction and the way we do things
65411 theres an inability for people to take americans where they dont want to go and thats really leadership
65412 the difficulty w faces is that george bush isnt running this year and a lot of voters based on the polls have written him off in a way hell be a fading figure in october when this movie comes out
65413 its a duel between two people who are politicians a cat and mouse combat between the two that would appeal to me and any dramatist
65414 its more a shoot out a tug of war its hand to hand combat using thoughts and words
65415 otherwise it feels like journalism then enough time passes where we get perspective on events if its told too quickly you end up just telling people what they already know
65416 this film is about how after the election were going to have to pick up the pieces and have to clean up the mess that bush made and how that mess affects the rest of the world
65417 all the other things that they got away with over the past eight years

65420 my uncle was going to adopt me at one point because my parents couldnt afford to have me anymore they had too much pride to go on welfare or food stamps
65421 i made a point of not watching it the novel became the point of reference for me and also the script it was very clear that we were making a film adaptation of the book as opposed to a remake of the television series and if it was to have any integrity at all it would have to stand alone as would my performance
65422 i didnt want any sense of intimidation from watching the series at all in not doing so it gave me a freedom
65423 im very much a modern woman and im probably a little bit more wild and spontaneous than julia is so i was bringing to julia probably a more earthy quality
65424 julia doesnt feel like she fits in but shes also bound by her family and her upbringing
65425 her future is not a question of choice it is a matter of faith
65426 once we were in the costumes and once we were with each other and in that house those things seemed to fall into place very quickly because the world is set up there for you and you just have to inhabit it
65427 i dont think anyone would see it in the film but how economical he is in his movements his facial expressions theres one thing he does with his mouth i was doing it a lot i was trying to mimic some of his gestures so it would look like we were together almost twin like in our moves
65428 england is very much caught up in a class system which has become a lot murkier especially since the second world war which was kind of the beginning of the crumbling of the aristocracy
65429 i think it has shifted a lot but its still there it still feels even within my blood and quite a difficult thing for english people to get over
65430 im kind of bridesheaded out we finished a year ago ive moved on to other projects but having seen it three times in the last few months and im going to see it again in new york and then again in london i need a break until i can come back both to our film objectively and the series objectively i will definitely revisit it but it wont be for a while

65597 nowhere in the world in no act of genocide in no war are so many people killed per minute per hour and per day as those who are killed by hunger and poverty on our planet

65599 abundance not scarcity best describes the supply of food in the world today
65600 more productive and resilient varieties of africas major food crops to enable africas small scale farmers to produce larger more diverse and reliable harvests
65601 to increase rice production across asia via the accelerated development and introduction of hybrid rice technologies
65602 the enormous power exerted by the largest agribusiness food corporations allows them essentially to control the cost of their raw materials purchased from farmers while at the same time keeping prices of food to the general public at high enough levels to ensure large profits
65603 industrial agrofuels are an economic social and environmental nonsense their development should be halted and agricultural production should focus on food as a priority
65604 biased in favour of capital intensive corporate agribusiness driven and export oriented agriculture

65608 if the government cannot lower the cost of living it simply has to leave if the police and un troops want to shoot at us thats ok because in the end if we are not killed by bullets well die of hunger
65609 the idea of the starving masses driven by their desperation to take to the streets and overthrow the ancien regime has seemed impossibly quaint since capitalism triumphed so decisively in the cold war and yet the headlines of the past month suggest that skyrocketing food prices are threatening the stability of a growing number of governments around the world when circumstances render it impossible to feed their hungry children normally passive citizens can very quickly become militants with nothing to lose
65610 spending on farming as a share of total public spending in developing countries fell by half between 1980 and 2004
65611 the investment in improved agricultural input packages and extension support tapered and eventually disappeared in most rural areas of africa under sap concern for boosting smallholders productivity was abandoned not only were governments rolled back foreign aid to agriculture dwindled world bank funding for agriculture itself declined markedly from 32 of total lending in 1976 8 to 11 7 in 1997 9
65612 the greatest demonstration of the historical failure of the capitalist model
65613 we found that a low level of hdl c may be a risk factor for memory loss in late midlife this suggests that low hdl c might also be a risk factor for dementia
65614 many previous investigations into the association between lipids and memory in the elderly have focused on total or ldl cholesterol because of their status as proven risk factors for cardiovascular disease our findings emphasize the need to expand the focus to hdl cholesterol thus physicians and patients should be encouraged to monitor levels of hdl cholesterol
65615 tempting to speculate that increasing levels of hdl c might protect our good memories
65616 we should remain extremely cautious when proposing therapeutic intervention on the basis of observational studies that do not imply causation this is particularly true for a study with a number of important limitations such as that of singh manoux et al
65617 thus hdl c remains a potentially promising but still remote target in the prevention of dementia and memory loss nonetheless these studies demand that we focus more effort on research at the interface between hdl c and brain function

65864 we recognise the threat we recognise that we have to fight against terrorism but we also think very strongly as we always have that sri lanka is fundamentally a democracy and that a democracy needs to be extended to all its citizens
65865 the people in sri lanka need to enjoy the respect for their human rights and enjoy the benefits of government
65866 we are working with the government of sri lanka with the people of sri lanka to try to ensure that human rights are respected that abuses are investigated thoroughly that people who are involved in abuses arent given any favour or position or support that children whove been taken as soldiers are let out and allowed to go to school
65867 talk about democracy and economic growth but well also talk about some of the problems facing sri lanka and hopefully see some progress towards solving these
65868 weve had these periods before it has not always been positive and with great momentum weve had periods when it looked frozen weve had periods when they were fighting and killing i hate to see it i mean these bus bombings are horrible and the things that are happening to ordinary sri lankans and what they have to put up with
65869 whatever is going on in the peace talks the democratic government has a responsibility to all of its citizens as military gains are made as the areas are opened up and come under government control all the citizens there need to benefit from democratic government and respect for their human rights tamil community muslim community
65870 it is pushing forward in military areas it needs to push forward in political areas as well and in the end the political arrangements in the island need to have a place for all citizens
65871 alongside whatever is going on militarily and we hope the tamil tigers will see that as well
65872 it doesnt take any of the responsibility away from the government in fact the tamil tigers are not actively promoting a peace agreement now but it doesnt take any of the responsibility away from the democratic government to reach out to all its citizens and provide them with the benefits of democracy
65873 today there is a realisation amongst saarc countries that it is only by cooperating within saarc that we will be able to strengthen ourselves individually and as a region and address the many common challenges that face us

65887 washington state ferries is facing serious financial and operational challenges
65888 im moving off the island because i cant afford the cost of commuting after 12 years of living here i have to pull my son out of school because i cant afford it
65889 sometimes im gotten off at the south end and theres no boat so now i have to call every time to make sure a boat will be there
65890 theres less guarantee youll even be able to get to work because its such a tenuous situation
65891 they should fix the boats or get new boats sooner before it becomes a problem
65892 they should plan ahead instead of taking the boats out of service only when the coast guard says they have to
65893 we have a fleet of very old boats that the ferry system needs to replace over the next 30 years

65911 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
65912 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
65913 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
65914 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
65915 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
65916 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
65917 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
65918 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
65919 about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
65920 theyre still on alert because we have another big wind event coming in tomorrow
65921 the fire has burned to the point now where people can see the flames
65922 its still flaming up there but theyve been on it day and night
65923 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
65924 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
65925 typically we dont see wildland fires of this magnitude until much later in the season
65926 but with the dry fuel conditions that we have throughout the state we could see similar situations arise again until we get a significant amount of rain

65943 what weve been covering up until now is the nomination process of the two major parties
65944 would be based on the past performance of those candidates and how much interest we think our readers have in them

65947 photographers have calmed down since britney started wearing clothes and lindsay went gay

65953 they talk about holding full fair and transparent proceedings yet a page from the 9 11 commission report can be classified as well as the entire testimony of two important witnesses
65954 the reason closed sessions are so troubling at guantanamo is because the government has so frequently claimed things have had to be classified to cover up abuse and torture
65955 in addition trials of this magnitude should have a public record if a significant amount of evidence and witness testimony is classified it will be very hard to trust any verdict
65956 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else

65986 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
65987 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
65988 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
65989 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

65992 the opponents of this administration have created a mythical figure in order to discredit the president all they have done is divert attention from the important work at hand the war in iraq and the war on terror in doing so they have dishonored the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform

65998 we find them to be very popular with dog owners and feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
65999 we worked closely with cesar in identifying under his direction core categories that he was interested in pursuing under his brand
66000 we created an extensive licensing program working diligently for a year on these products
66001 we wanted to create a sense in our stores that there is an event going on as customers pass through and see the brand everywhere

66012 you do get weekends that are washouts but we still have a good time anyway we would hope to have at least two good nights of observations
66013 we have talks and an astro quiz and the children have a water rocket competition on the sunday
66014 on the observations some people stay up all night those who dont can put notices on their tents or camper vans to say they want waking up at 3am to start observing
66015 people come from all over the country we would expect about 100
66016 they are all usually members of their local astronomical society
66017 if the weather is good then we would expect to see jupiter
66018 there are also telescopes on the site that will let us see nebulae and objects from deep space you can take a memory stick along and download images from computer driven telescopes
66019 starfest is one of the highlights of the astronomical calendar
66020 following the death of an 81 year old female resident at the lanercost house care home in carlisle on july 23 a post mortem carried out by a home office pathologist has established she suffered a broken neck
66021 this has been a tragic incident and detectives are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death and will report their findings to the coroner
66022 i will rape you and teach you some manners a knife can teach anyone manners
66023 i am going to burn this place down tonight and you will be inside
66024 carlisle is a thriving fairtrade city with many of our shops caf s restaurants and businesses using and selling fairtrade products this is a very strong visual way of promoting fairtrade but just as importantly it provides a very attractive focal point for visitors shoppers and residents who enjoy the cathedral grounds
66025 feels giving back and doing community work is very important
66026 caron is a people person and she got to know a lot of people and she knew the issues too
66027 its a frame construction with aluminum siding and had been rebuilt around the original cottage we turned the lower level into a bedroom and bathroom
66028 it can be 30 below outside and the stove will give off enough heat that we have to open the windows
66029 when our neighbours cottage burnt down we loaned them our truck tent and they lived in it that summer
66030 then when my boat sank they let me know and helped me arrange to have it towed and repaired
66031 theres prep time and then the driving to get there
66032 you can only tax people so much there are a lot of retirees who own property there and that has to be taken into account
66033 really appreciate the amount of work she puts into her role as councillor
66034 is very much appreciated she works by conference call and other ways since she is often far away our area is 155 square kilometres with 105 lakes and only 2 000 houses
66035 people who come here and build are very concerned about the quality of the water and other elements
66036 they have a big investment and they are willing to pay for it sometimes we have big debates
66037 property owners who have lived here all their lives would like to see a bit more development
66038 newer people would like to be the last ones to come here and build
66039 during the ceremony the pews will face one way and after that we will all go outside where during the cocktail hour we will be entertained by a fellow from la chute who plays the fiddle then we will go back inside where everything will be rearranged for a dinner
66040 make this enjoyable meet new people and find new products
66041 youll have the ability to do main streets infill suburban type streets with single family homes row houses all these different things so youve got a greater flexibility in town planning
66042 were not going to do earth berm houses for 400 people
66043 so you take the technologies that we have and you tweak them a little bit and you tweak them again
66044 i know that a contractors going to come here and say well thats cool thats cool theres no way im going to bloody well do that oh thats neat what the hell is this if they take 10 if they take 25 per cent thats amazing
66045 we have people picking up nails with magnets we have people picking up foam all the wood that is smaller than a certain size is being chipped for mulch for the site
66046 walls where they exist at all are angled or else undulate to eliminate hard edges
66047 they are inverted triangles thinner below than on top my inspiration was atlas holding the world on his shoulders
66048 i came up with the idea when i was doing a major renovation on my berkeley street printing studio and needed somewhere to store my equipment one of my first customers was ken dryden right after he moved back to toronto after playing for montreal i used to be a goalie as a kid i saw it as a good sign
66049 sex went from being something dirty that i experienced while growing up in mississauga to being something beautiful when combined with the kama sutra and tantric philosophy
66050 i envisioned a sitting area with a giant jukebox and a fireplace and a big home theatre
66051 some of the original people got married and divorced in the meantime and many of their businesses opened and closed
66052 by the time the building was ready to move into many in the original group had walked away
66053 i was never happier than when building this condo with my own hands
66054 i saw the yellow house and i just had to buy it i planned to come down here and never lift a finger
66055 one point five million was a big listing down here seven years ago
66056 it was shocking shocking he returned to the office and said hed bought a house in picton nobody could believe it
66057 it was the talk of the office for months and then of course we all had to come up and see it
66058 its food wine and the arts its got it all
66059 chuck still has a few signs that he has to change its quite a job
66060 when you have 100 listings in the county and put chestnut park signs on them its instant impact
66061 i can show you houses that ive sold four or five times
66062 well be able to show people properties in all price ranges
66063 generally speaking prices dont have a lot higher to go i dont think youre going to see a run up
66064 even if its not as hot its still a strong market
66065 we want a century house on the water in the county preferably stone
66066 it will be a sophisticated toronto couple who will buy this spectacular waterfront location
66067 people want all done when they move down here they dont want to have to renovate
66068 its not all about the country dream or the waterfront its about having a real life in town
66069 strange days are upon the residents of many a suburban cul de sac
66070 once tidy yards have become overgrown as the houses they front have gone vacant signs of physical and social disorder are spreading
66071 vandals have kicked in doors and stripped the copper wire from vacant houses drug users and homeless people have furtively moved in
66072 the phenomenon is the same at the height of the boom 10 000 new homes were built there in just four years now many are empty renters of dubious character occupy others graffiti broken windows and other markers of decay have multiplied
66073 a structural change is under way in the housing market a major shift in the way many americans want to live and work it has shaped the current downturn steering some of the worst problems away from the cities and toward the suburban fringes and its effects will be felt more strongly and more broadly as the years pass
66074 just as the demand for suvs plummets and consumers have finally begun to see the point of hybrids people are turning away from sprawling exurbs toward urban neighbourhoods and inner suburbs
66075 but whats happening here goes a lot deeper than the end of cheap oil we are now passing through the early development of a wholly new geographic order what geographers call the spatial fix of which the move back toward the city is just one part
66076 the shift from the suburbs toward the urban core is most pronounced as talented ambitious people trade more space for shorter commutes
66077 doesnt work its too low to be a work surface
66078 the height is right for rolling out dough but its too narrow
66079 the developer took a large church and only made five units as opposed to trying to cram in as many one level condos as possible
66080 it gets a ton of interest because its so unique
66081 the only reason the owners are moving out is because they want to be closer to their daughter who is having their first grandchild
66082 the conversion maintained the integrity of the original church and used only the finest of materials
66083 its perfect for people downsizing for example from rosedale or forest hill
66084 it still feels like a home yet youre in a smaller more unique space in an amazing location
66085 this was the most logical place for a media room because it has a big stone fireplace and there is no bathroom
66086 with the ceilings being so high i dont think thats conducive for a bedroom
66087 i do run from the bedroom to the laundry room
66088 and the ceiling is so high i could put up a basketball hoop and then i could sit down on my chesterfield and throw it
66089 everybody said i should live here in the new house for a little while
66090 even my doctor told me to put my feet in the salt ocean water he thinks its good for my legs
66091 i dont want to make too much dirt you know i try to keep everything nice and neat
66092 thats what i said at the beginning and im still homesick
66093 the biggest problem is a lot of times is they dont think of it as their house for a while
66094 it takes a lot of time for them to fit into that mentality that they can do whatever they want with it
66095 i think the pne home is so iconic that people do plan on living in it and i would certainly say in recent years the concept of the sunshine coast actually enhances that
66096 you dream of it but its also a great tradition your grandparents bought tickets your parents bought tickets and now you buy tickets
66097 some of the first homes in east vancouver were pne prize homes
66098 but i think people dont live here any more they sold their places i think most people sell them
66099 we loved the house but it was more of a showpiece
66100 it wasnt really a house to have kids in it was all brass and glass and mirrors you felt like you had to go with a cloth after the child it was an endless thing of cleaning up
66101 i will go back to the old one in mission and get that one fixed up and sell that one and then get something probably in abbotsford that is smaller and will suit us a bit more

66106 taken an instant liking to her because she is visible and direct and informal without turning informality into a cloying down home soupiness
66107 republican men know theres been a change in republican women
66108 a small group of radicals and extremists has assumed control of the national democratic party
66109 to see that we get to the bottom of this
66110 is frequently spoken of as a possible vice president but why not president
66111 to top it off she has looks and charm plus that great political asset the gift of gab
66112 women have benefited from the barriers she overcame in government diplomacy and politics throughout her career
66113 whose imagination talents and dreams have created the disney magic

66124 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
66125 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island

66127 the bush administrations detainee treatment and interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation as human rights leader seven years of secrets whispered in secret rooms must give way to on the record testimony and open hearings
66128 the cia and the department of defense categorically deny having interrogated any terrorist suspects or terrorism related detainee on diego garcia in any cases since september 11 2001 with the exceptions of the two cases in 2002 in which detainees transited dg that previously have been disclosed to the uk government there have been no other instances in which terrorist suspects or terrorism related detainees transited or were held there
66129 the u s government is holding prisoners in a secret system of offshore prisons beyond the reach of adequate supervision accountability or law
66130 with the amount of water the sewerage facilities built up and it was just a situation where we deemed it was safer for students to be home because we were going to have to close toilets acting associate principal sue nesbit said

66152 why federal aid to the flood victims in iowa should require a budgetary offset when the invasion and occupation of iraq does not
66153 communities residents and businesses affected by the floods need assistance it is totally unacceptable that any disaster relief is being withheld from the people of iowa
66154 the 2 65 billion in disaster assistance approved by congress and signed into law is critical to our states recovery by immediately releasing this funding this assistance can quickly be distributed to provide individuals and businesses with the security to rebuild and communities with the support necessary to recover from this disaster
66155 releasing these funds now will help iowans rebuild from a devastating loss we want to work with our partners on the federal level and appreciate what they have done so far and we strongly encourage them to work with us
66156 the floods of 2008 have caused unprecedented damage in iowa and it is essential that disaster assistance funding goes directly to the impacted communities as quickly as possible i was glad to help pass the initial 2 65 billion in disaster relief funding but i have been disappointed to learn that some of this funding is being held up we strongly urge the release of this funding so that iowa families communities and businesses can continue to rebuild

66173 something was happening within the church that she didnt approve of
66174 rhoda left the church because of problems that were happening inside the church
66175 so as far as what im hearing its some kind of financial thing
66176 it wouldnt surprise me if her death was part and parcel to the tremendous turmoil involving her former church
66177 victory is impossible in afghanistan today one must try to negotiate there is no other solution
66178 theres something happening here what it is aint exactly clear
66179 nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion
66180 gender womens involvement and sexuality in the ideologies and strategies of a transnational palestinian political movement
66181 used the whole state apparatus they all report to him they all obey him his control is absolute
66182 he wants to end the history of the fur masalit and zaghawa people
66183 the u s israel and some of their european allies have begun to recognize that their policy of trying to defeat their enemies by isolating and vilifying them has failed
66184 opening up a third front right now would be extremely stressful for us
66185 this is a very unstable part of the world and i dont need it to be more unstable
66186 who cares if we stay in iraq 100 years if thats what it takes for victory
66187 how deeply the afghan government was involved in protecting the opium trade
66188 we are running the risk of repeating the mistake the soviet union made we run the risk that our military presence will gradually turn the afghan population entirely against us
66189 yes those evil neocons made terrible blunders but its beyond the pale to challenge the dogma that the u s is by nature a force for good or insist that washingtons goals in the middle east have something to do with oil
66190 my goal is to cut government in half in twenty five years to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub
66191 americans for tax reform is a wonderful sounding name as far as im concerned its a front organization for grover norquist lobbying activities
66192 doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results
66193 we consistently dont have a revenue problem we have a spending problem
66194 we are trying to change the tones in the state capitals and turn them toward bitter nastiness and partisanship
66195 its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
66196 ill tell you who should be tortured and killed at guantanamo every filthy democrat in the u s congress
66197 i was so angry and appalled and the far left has made this guy into a hero this glick guy and it was just revolting and if i could have whacked him i would have
66198 if i ran this country id hang the lawyer i would try her for aiding and abetting terrorism id hang her and id hang every lawyer who went down to guant namo to defend those murderers
66199 its a little surprising to find a uu church had anyone attending who would stand up to a gunman
66200 a tragedy such as this makes us acutely conscious of the beauty and fragility of our lives and those of our loved ones i am especially saddened by this intrusion of violence into a worship service involving children and youth i know that many people both in knoxville and around the country are struggling with shock and grief right now i pray that those so affected will find strength and comfort
66201 auto id sensor networks provide rfid systems with the ability to manage data collected from a networks edge
66202 the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region
66203 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
66204 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
66205 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
66206 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment
66207 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
66208 we are moving towards understanding whether there were or could be places on mars that are habitable
66209 even after the collapse of the negotiations stock markets in the world rose moderately
66210 i have doubted if past wto discussions would have any great impact on the world economy
66211 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
66212 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
66213 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
66214 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
66215 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
66216 everyone in this government is responsible for a string of failures we must let the people decide through new elections
66217 we are not worried by the change in israeli prime minister because we know that israel is seriously engaged to remain involved in the negotiation process with the palestinians
66218 hitched its fate to the possibility of achieving an agreement by the end of the year
66219 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate i will then prove my innocence
66220 the olmert who spoke yesterday from the garden of his compound in jerusalem was a crushed and battered man tainted by allegations lacking public trust or a sympathetic ear
66221 this government has finished its mission irrespective of who will head kadima
66222 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
66223 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
66224 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
66225 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
66226 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
66227 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
66228 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
66229 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
66230 believe me if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would
66231 i tried to get to lay down at 4 oclock this morning but was up 10 minutes later because every time i closed my eyes id see this man in the window with some guys head i had just smoked a cigarette with
66232 challenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins
66233 proponents of open source software continue efforts to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products although we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security productivity and total cost of ownership the open source software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance sales of our products may decline we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products and revenue and operating margins may decline
66234 another development is the software as a service business model under which companies provide applications data and related services over the internet providers use primarily advertising or subscription based revenue models recent advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies it is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful
66235 an important element of our business model has been to create platform based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer vertically integrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins
66236 with all the evidence that is now before them i dont see any reason why the authorities should continue with these investigations of alleged sodomy
66237 in any other system where there is justice and fairness the powers would have by now shut down the investigations and cleared my name
66238 in 2007 harman said only 181 out of 2 212 reports of military sexual assaults or 8 percent were referred to courts martial
66239 but when it came time for the military to defend itself the panel was told that the pentagons top official on sexual abuse dr kaye whitley was ordered not to show up despite a subpoena
66240 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
66241 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
66242 akba has anti inflammatory properties and we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee
66243 the high incidence of adverse effects associated with currently available medications has created great interest in the search for an effective and safe alternative treatment

66247 it was an entertaining lively match our players took the initiative from the start and youve always got to be satisfied when you score four goals
66248 that was definitely the best weve played in pre season
66249 my plan b is to go get another job exactly like the one i have now

66256 i was born to tell you i love you i am torn to do what i have too
66257 youre the only one who really knew me at all how can you just walk away from me when all i can do is watch you leave cos we shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears youre the only one who really knew me at all so take a look at me now well theres just an empty space and theres nothing left here to remind me just the memory of your face oh take a look at me now theres just an empty space and you coming back to me is against the odds and thats what ive got to face i wish i could just make you turn around turn around and see me cry theres so much i need to say to you so many reasons why youre the only one who really knew me at all so take a look at me now well theres just an empty space and theres nothing left here to remind me
66258 cause i was born to tell you i love you
66259 thats like the beginning of every shitty horror flick ive ever seen
66260 if you beat a dog so much 1 day it will bite back
66261 just in case my pussy would turn into a windsock lets get down with the scalpel again
66262 when youre looking at the value to a team or the value of the person whos playing art monk was a big strong guy who wasnt afraid to go inside and catch the ball in the middle of the field he caught most of his passes in the middle i think he had the toughest yards of course we could have played him outside all the time but we didnt do that i always thought that went to his credit his stats actually could have been much more
66263 art was huge for a wide receiver he could run he had great hands he was very physical he had the talent and he had the work ethic i kind of molded myself a little after him just watching the way he worked out we spent many summers running sprints on the track he was one of the hardest workers
66264 i am so fortunate to count darrell his wife jewell and the rest of the green family among my friends i know how much redskins fans mean to them and it is such an accurate reflection of what they mean to us art may be the classiest redskin ever he never let up on the field and in his off the field activities he let his work speak loudly for itself his entry into the hall is long overdue but that is all behind us now well be celebrating with him and for him for years to come
66265 in art and darrell i have never seen two people who have been loved so much and it comes from how they played the game and what they did do in the community there were a lot of guys who played extremely hard by their side but never achieved the kind of respect they deserve because of the way they lived their life and the way that they played the game i take my hat off to both of them because they are a tribute to the redskins legacy they played the game the way it should have been played all heart all 100 percent giving it all you have
66266 it was so exceptional for a cornerback to play for that long i tell darrell the lord must have blessed you with tremendous talent and speed for you to play that long he has great moral character and is a great family guy he meant a lot to our community he takes care of himself and is extremely well trained he was a dynamic leader on our team and a great producer you could not find a person better qualified who played that long and did all the things he did
66267 darrell signifies perseverance and competitiveness and is an all around great guy at the same time a guy like him is really hard to find he has always been a stalwart in the community and hes always maintained a good heart
66268 probably one of the best defensive backs to play the game and i think a credit to the game off the field also whenever it came time to play darrell i had to get myself going and i knew it was going to be tough because he was going to come with everything he is one of the guys that you draw inspiration from and ive enjoyed playing with him
66269 younger players should look at darrell green in terms of their careers and say i would like to model my career after him
66270 i think their predominant colour was a greyish green though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying voices clearly wed tar articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked
66271 it happened in june about the anniversary of the meteors fall and the poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not describe in her raving there was not a single specific noun but only verbs and pronouns things moved and changed and fluttered and ears tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds something was taken away she was being drained of something something was fastening itself on her that ought not to be someone must make it keep off nothing was ever still in the night the walls and windows shifted nahum did not send her to the county asylum but let her wander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and others even when her expression changed he did nothing but when the boys grew afraid of her and thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she made faces at him he decided to keep her locked in the attic by july she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours and before that month was over nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the dark as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetation
66272 these vertebrates as well as an infinity of other life forms animal and vegetable marine terrestrial and aerial were the products of unguided evolution acting on life cells made by the old ones but escaping beyond their radius of attention
66273 and the bird of heaven flew before and led us toward the basalt pillars of the west but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full moon in my mind i would often picture the unknown
66274 is the abode of gods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold its forests are of aloe and sandalwood even as the fragrant groves of camorin and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with song on the green and flowery mountains of cathuria stand temples of pink marble rich with carven and painted glories and having in their courtyards cool fountains of silver where purr with ravishing music the scented waters that come from the grotto born river narg and the cities of cathuria are cinctured with golden walls and their pavements also are of gold in the gardens of these cities are strange orchids and perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and amber at night the streets and the gardens are lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from the three colored shell of the tortoise and here resound the soft notes of the singer and the lutanist and the houses of the cities of cathuria are all palaces each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of the sacred narg of marble and porphyry are the houses and roofed with glittering gold that reflects the rays of the sun and enhances the splendor of the cities as blissful gods view them from the distant peaks fairest of all is the palace of the great monarch dorieb whom some say to be a demi god and others a god high is the and many are the turrets of marble upon its walls in its wide halls many multitudes assemble and here hang the trophies of the ages and the roof is of pure gold set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living olympus and the floor of the palace is of glass under which flow the cunningly lighted waters of the narg gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the bounds of lovely cathuria
66275 the most merciful thing in the world i think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents we live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should voyage far the sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto harmed us little but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age

66305 if there is an economic slowdown no one bothered to tell the mobile device buying public
66306 in particular consumers in emerging markets in asia the middle east africa and south america shrugged off inflation fears to sign up as mobile phone users these healthy gains in net subscriber additions are stimulating replacement and upgrade sales in developed markets handset purchases tended to be flat but those consumers who did purchase dug deeper and paid out more for coveted higher end handsets and smart phones

66341 then there were the geese the most admirable creatures ive ever met we raised chinese white geese a common breed and they have distinctive personalities they mate for life and adhere to family values that would shame most of those who dine on them while one of our geese was sitting on her eggs her gander would go out foraging for food and if he found some delicacy he would rush back to give it to his mate sometimes i would offer males a dish of corn to fatten them up but it was impossible for they would take it all home to their true loves once a month or so we would slaughter the geese when i was 10 years old my job was to lock the geese in the barn and then rush and grab one then i would take it out and hold it by its wings on the chopping block while my dad or someone else swung the ax the 150 geese knew that something dreadful was happening and would cower in a far corner of the barn and run away in terror as i approached then i would grab one and carry it away as it screeched and struggled in my arms very often one goose would bravely step away from the panicked flock and walk tremulously toward me it would be the mate of the one i had caught male or female and it would step right up to me protesting pitifully it would be frightened out of its wits but still determined to stand with and comfort its lover

66383 the no 1 concern if im going to take a stance is whats going to happen to the cincinnati reds junior had one or two years left and theres still the possibility that the injury bug could step in again
66384 he was a great kid and still is a great man
66385 i hope he gets a chance to play in the world series
66386 i would have liked to see him finish out the year

66390 february 10 2000 february 10 2000 this day will go down in reds history and will go down in major league history as the day one of the biggest trades in our sport took place when the michael jordan of baseball came home to cincinnati he is the player of the decade an all century player a player who was born in cincinnati has become one of the best players in our sport and has come home

66392 this has put cincinnati back on the baseball map on top of the entire baseball world
66393 played hurt all year ive had a sore hamstring ive refused to come out when im hurt
66394 you should check things out before you put things on the air
66395 did you ask me if i was ok didnt you see me limping do you even know ive had a bad hamstring for a long time
66396 im relieved because they told me it was only a strain and isnt like last years that one was more pain
66397 junior did what he is supposed to do he got into a rundown on that play
66398 he came toward third and stopped quick i dont know how you can stop something like that from happening but he did what he needed to do
66399 im not going to play again until im 100 percent healthy
66400 just when he was starting to get his swing down and it looked like he was about to take off
66401 that goes back a few years to when i wouldnt autograph a ball for him
66402 he rips me all the time so why would i sign a ball for him hes ripped me ever since he needs to grow up
66403 it wasnt me who threw a ball into the center field seats after blowing a save that hit a woman it wasnt me fighting my manager lou piniella when he managed the reds and dibble was in the bullpen it wasnt me ripping off my uniform on the field when he blew a game after giving up a game winning home run in new york to bobby bonilla hes just mad and bitter because he was never more than a 100 miles an hour set up guy
66404 three years ago nobody heard of this surgery never heard of a torn hamstring being fixed
66405 nobody was doing it with this type of injury there is no way griffey could ever again play center field or left field or right field or anywhere zero none
66406 conversations i had with the reds recently revealed that nothing was up as far as trades other than a couple of inquiries they told me he was going to remain with the reds and they never came to us to ask whether junior would accept a trade
66407 i hadnt heard about any kind of trade but i did think it odd that the front office told kent mercker david weathers and adam dunn they wouldnt be traded but nobody said anything to me and nobody asked me or my agent anything about going to any other team

66415 when i was watching that game i said id love to play for that team
66416 it became my goal thats when it was really real
66417 its the single most important position for a lot of reasons
66418 you have a team full of players who are used to having the ball in their hands at the end of the game and getting a lot of touches you have to be able to manage that part and make each player feel like theyre going to get the ball and score even though theyre not
66419 and youre going to be challenged in a way that could prevent you from playing for a gold medal game but the point guard they think ahead and have to identify those moments because those will rate your leadership quality

66532 unless we reinvest now we wont be the greatest country in the world we cant sustain it the world is changing
66533 we were blessed these last 40 years by having a system that was new with excess capacity
66534 we saw the benefits of what a good transportation system can help do to build america
66535 the issue is not a revenue problem it is a spending problem and an abuse problem
66536 best equipped to understand their own congestion problems and deal with those
66537 we dont charge people for using a particular road for a particular time and as a consequence we get overuse
66538 we get a situation where roads are underpriced and we get congestion

66552 loki was a hacker the other gods feared him but they needed his tools
66553 this governor has done more than anyone else to expand gambling even further with no real benefit to the state
66554 what weve asked for in terms of the process was to limit or eliminate contributions during these compact negotiations
66555 this whole process is the problem and the publics really concerned about it both from the union standpoints and from the native american standpoint why is the money all flowing to one side after these agreements are done
66556 revenue sharing is a worthy issue to deliberate on there are those who think it would be a terrific resource for our state to help fund our school and essential services there are others including former king county prosecutor norm maleng who had tremendous concerns about expansion of gambling
66557 thats what i remember about 2005 i didnt hear anything about revenue sharing being desired what i heard was we need to be sure theres not enormous expansion of gambling in our state i pledge as chairwoman of this committee that if we have legislation introduced on revenue sharing that i would hold a hearing on it
66558 the objections about that came from the same camp that is now accusing the governor of turning her back on revenue sharing my recollection was that the concerns of other tribes were more directed at how revenue would be shared among the tribes
66559 eleven states do 13 states do not because the concept is not defined in the 1988 federal act its sort of a balancing act
66560 they got the state to agree not to expand non indian gaming that includes horse racing the state lottery and card rooms
66561 people talk about revenue sharing like its this low hanging fruit that the state is passing up but its not like that
66562 the objections were of reservation gambling and the unlimited wagering the revenue sharing is something that has been concocted since then i remember having this discussion with the governor because i said at the time she had encouraged that i said at the time that is too high a price to pay we knew it was there we said why do it because you get a bad bargain
66563 its just real interesting to go back and talk to the other governors they do not support the expansion of gambling even though they did at the time that allowed it they have come and testified against any bill that has expanded gambling and most of them question the allowances theyve already given tribes or nontribal
66564 people want ubiquitous cell service on their wireless phones everywhere they go and that includes their home and offices

66566 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
66567 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
66568 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
66569 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
66570 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
66571 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
66572 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
66573 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
66574 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
66575 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
66576 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
66577 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony
66578 the companys relentless focus on and ability to meet demand within emerging markets helped propel shipment volumes forward
66579 this campaign has had extraordinary success in engaging children during the last year and the new ads along with the enhancements to the website will continue the momentum
66580 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
66581 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy
66582 intel has demonstrated that the performance of their systems can help facebook scale our infrastructure

66586 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are
66587 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
66588 microsoft has an open intellectual property licensing policy but in situations such as this in which a reasonable licensing agreement cannot be reached despite our best efforts we have no choice but to pursue legal action to protect our innovations
66589 primaxs practice of using our innovations without taking a patent license is unfair to the many companies that have already licensed our technology so we are taking action to protect both our partners and our innovations
66590 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time
66591 by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
66592 it seems that while i can log in to mobileme and view my calendar contacts i continue to not be able to see mail as mail comes up as a completely blank page
66593 when i am an old woman i shall wear purple
66594 theyll fix it search is an iterative process but what the surge of interest in cuil showed is that theres a huge pent up demand for an alternative to google
66595 dr patterson joined google in 2004 and filed six patent applications
66596 now as an ex googler or xoogler she has focused on some of the weak points in the google approach to search namely
66597 were engineers and we are reading the press for good feedback and critical feedback
66598 if we didnt have improvements to make we wouldnt have a job here
66599 cuil hit google with its larger index of 120 million web pages processed to googles 30 to 40 million pages
66600 keep in mind that size doesnt matter but it is a public relations hook
66601 the surge in users monday caused slowdowns and brown outs these are normal glitches google had them cuil has them
66602 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
66603 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
66604 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
66605 if its too dangerous to touch it cant be clean
66606 lack of time prevented us from being able to address the outstanding concerns of one delegation
66607 no position has been taken by the security council on the question of whether to take any action in the light of the moreno ocampo proposal to indict president beshir
66608 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
66609 i want to give high marks to the british delegation
66610 they discussed in good faith with everybody they were very cooperative they tried to accommodate the concerns of major parties
66611 to pledge and contribute the helicopter aerial reconnaissance ground transport engineering and logistical units and other force enablers required
66612 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
66613 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
66614 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
66615 youre going to get a call from a friend of mine back home in mississippi
66616 his son was in an accident here and was arrested for dui will you see him
66617 in tones that would take the bloom off the sincerest form of romance
66618 let me get this straight two experienced san francisco vice cops nailed you participating in an act of sex in your truck on a public street with a known prostitute that you picked up in the middle of the tenderloin after receiving the miranda warning you admitted that youd paid her the money got it
66619 they told me theyd seen her before and were watching when i showed up so they followed us both if im convicted ill lose my job my wife will kill me if she finds out about this
66620 one of the officers told me that she was really a he
66621 the jury is going to find this interesting what am i going to tell the twelve jurors that the cops got the wrong man when they got them both
66622 hmm what im hearing is that you really dont want to go to trial and also that now you want me to get you off
66623 how are we going to make justice triumph in this situation
66624 my clients position your honor is that he is the victim of consumer fraud
66625 what my client would like to do your honor is to donate 100 to the salvation army as court costs and have this case dismissed
66626 its helped me realize that i can pretty much do everything i used to do i just do it differently
66627 ive seen so much and learned so much talking to these guys
66628 you can get a wealth of knowledge as they show you things that you thought werent possible before
66629 its great being around people in similar situations and be able to share stories and network
66630 everybody wants to win but being around here and getting to learn from each other is inspirational
66631 now its time for me to help steer someone else in the right direction
66632 it might not be the life you had planned but it can also be a new beginning like being reborn
66633 i like to be able to give back what ive learned during the past 13 years
66634 if we can get these guys out here and show them what people just like them are able to do it can help them a lot
66635 weve got to let them know that there are still opportunities for them to do things they just have to go out there and try
66636 thats what the spirit of the games is all about
66637 i mean the gun was like really big i just said oh my god and then i started running
66638 and when they cant get it from the pharmacy they get desperate and this is what happens
66639 if he came in here and asked me for oxycodone and i said i didnt have any he probably would have shot us all because he would have been desperate
66640 he would have killed us all and then ransacked the pharmacy looking for it
66641 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
66642 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
66643 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
66644 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
66645 kami ski wstaje rano pali cygaro i my li jak zaistnie
66646 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
66647 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
66648 we are absolutely thrilled with the school joe has become a very social child who is comfortable with people of all ages he is learning so much so quickly i know in my heart this is where joe belongs
66649 my eyes are vague blue like the sky and change all the time
66650 should this be tough for me do i have a right to feel everything that i am feeling
66651 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
66652 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
66653 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
66654 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
66655 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
66656 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
66657 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
66658 i am hopeful that the sentences imposed today will serve as a reminder that the right to disagree with the government does not permit anyone to jeopardize the lives of our brave law enforcement officers
66659 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
66660 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
66661 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
66662 took everybody by surprise because the african union is a partner in the darfur issue
66663 compulsively signing up for every new service i run across like the addict i am
66664 what is the one thing that you wish your wife significant other knew but you feel you cant explain to her or tell her
66665 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
66666 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
66667 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
66668 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
66669 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
66670 theres a reason pit bulls are the best fighting dogs theyre not the biggest or the strongest or the scariest theyre the most tenacious once they commit to taking a piece out of your leg theres precious little on heaven or earth that can get them off you so be a pit bull not a chihuahua
66671 buck up suck up and come back when you foul up
66672 our worst fears were substantiated when we started going through information from the army
66673 her body was dumped in a dirty filthy contractors tent
66674 pfc lavena johnson was raped beaten set on fire and worse army calls it suicide
66675 i told my wife i could let it go but someone would get away with murder and i couldnt live with myself
66676 women serving in the us military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq the scope of the problem was brought into acute focus for me during a visit to the west los angeles va health center where i met female veterans and their doctors my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 of the female veterans seen there say there were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military and 29 said they were raped during their military service
66677 so all the deaths and injuries at gitmo and abu ghraib were just sports injuries
66678 come to iraq and get rich and have all the target practice you want on real people
66679 i told my wife i could let it go but someone would get away with murder and i couldnt live with myself
66680 everything in war is barbaric but the worst barbarity of war is that it forces men collectively to commit acts which individually they would revolt with their whole being
66681 i do not recollect in all the animal kingdom a single species but man which is eternally and systematically engaged in the destruction of its species
66682 war is not healthy for children and other living things

66686 war what is it good for absolutely nothin say it again
66687 everything in war is barbaric but the worst barbarity of war is that it forces men collectively to commit acts which individually they would revolt with their whole being
66688 i do not recollect in all the animal kingdom a single species but man which is eternally and systematically engaged in the destruction of its species
66689 war is not healthy for children and other living things
66690 im just writing the report now we havent quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape
66691 but when it came time for the military to defend itself the panel was told that the pentagons top official on sexual abuse dr kaye whitley was ordered not to show up despite a subpoena
66692 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
66693 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
66694 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
66695 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
66696 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
66697 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
66698 believe me if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would
66699 i tried to get to lay down at 4 oclock this morning but was up 10 minutes later because every time i closed my eyes id see this man in the window with some guys head i had just smoked a cigarette with
66700 where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers 55 this is the carpenters son surely is not his mother the woman called mary and his brothers james and joseph and simon and jude 56 his sisters too are they not all here with us so where did the man get it all
66701 a prophet is despised only in his own country and in his own house
66702 what are you doing in here you better not take anything cause im watching you

66704 you never know what to expect when you get pulled over by police and thats how it is when youre black
66705 you never know what to expect when you get pulled over by the police and thats how it is when youre black
66706 is that what youre wearing to drive back to athens
66707 you are going to be driving through a lot of southern counties now im not saying youre going to do anything wrong but you are a young black man and if you get pulled over by one of these southern sheriffs or policemen they are going to take one look at you and get the wrong idea theyre not going to treat you like they would a white boy dressed like that
66708 you have no right to put your hands on me
66709 who the black girl that just went into the restroom

66725 instead of belligerently citing india as a motive for our own inaction we can experiment invent share and guide we have the breathing room and the economic reserve to lead rather than follow
66726 unlike australia where delayed economic growth may cause increased reliance on social security for some and drops in discretionary spending for most delayed economic growth in india will cause death its as simple as that
66727 india saw its millionaire population surging in 2007 by 22 6 per cent which is higher than any other country in the world

66742 i can go to disney and be a director or i can stay here and make history
66743 we knew that he wasnt just pitching for the film he was pitching for the survival of the group
66744 put down your pencil and your paintbrush and do it another way
66745 i had won an oscar for tin toy but i could hardly afford to have a family and disney was dangling a huge amount of money in front of me
66746 yeah he could have made lots more money at disney
66747 but these guys were motivated more by what they could do creatively than by how many dollars they made

66765 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
66766 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
66767 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted

66785 with xdna x rite is giving automakers and their suppliers the appropriate tool to distinguish characteristics of effect paints that cant be detected much less analyzed by other systems
66786 we coined the term xdna to emphasize the fact that each effect paint has a unique three dimensional mathematical model similar to the way that each person has a unique dna structure the exact name for package is dynamic numerical analysis but we figured xdna was a little easier to say
66787 x rite will first market the xdna system with ma98 to the automakers and automotive suppliers in the united states and europe but the package has potential applications in other industries including appliance manufacturing and cosmetics formulation
66788 the xdna system of software with ma98 is available in most languages

66825 its the werewolf in me i guess the stand was particularly fulfilling because there i got a chance to scrub the whole human race and man it was fun much of the compulsive driven feeling i had while i worked on the stand came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke

66862 oh god nooo dont leave us name your salary just pick a figure and consider it done my dear
66863 hes given us a lot of trouble over the years as a team so maybe a lot of people will like to see him gone
66864 hes a great hitter so im glad we dont have to face him anymore
66865 he can go to the other league thats all right
66866 not too many players leave there happy its been very well documented over the years i think back to mo vaughn and nomar garciaparra it goes on and on
66867 when theyre ready to get rid of a player they do it
66868 the best 3 4 guys in the league since 2003
66869 when youve got a good lineup and you get two guys of that ability it makes them tough it makes them who theyve been
66870 youre not going to find too many teams that can put two guys like that in the lineup back to back when those guys are both in the lineup and healthy that team has been successful
66871 i mean i know manny beats us up bad and i know mannys a great player
66872 it sure changes their lineup but theyve got a good lineup jason bays a pretty good player too im not sure theres a big drop off there
66873 they felt like they had to take care of a problem
66874 it started getting to be too much theyve never been afraid to trade guys or let guys go when they felt it was a way to better their team
66875 i made some phone calls and threw some ideas out but we werent really close to anything
66876 if there was something that made sense i would have done it it just came down to what people wanted
66877 im ready to rock and roll if we could match up with somebody we just couldnt match value for value in the marketplace
66878 if i find something a week from now or a month from now im ready to go if were comfortable with it
66879 hes pitching himself into the mix no doubt about it
66880 i think thats too much it was one pitch one mistake
66881 i have to be realistic and i dont see a big chance
66882 its pure tryout for me make a team or leave
66883 im no fool i know im not coming there to tear down the first line and sure im not coming to accept a marginal role as a fourth line player but i believe im still capable to play third line there
66884 i came here to win im always going to be like that
66885 he understands what its like in a sense to be a yankee hes excited about being a yankee and what lies before us and the challenges
66886 for me its hard to believe that i am talking to you guys in yankee stadium and wearing a yankees uniform but i am happy
66887 molina is one of the premier backups in the game today he stepped up and did a tremendous job holding the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorge
66888 we needed to upgrade in terms of protection against injury in terms of offense i think its a significant acquisition for us
66889 im not the one making decisions im here just to play when joe puts me in the lineup i just feel happy about the job ive been doing ive been proud of myself for giving this team what they needed at the time jorge went down
66890 ill tell him dont ever say no to your wife
66891 im grateful to be able to give back to the community
66892 i can tell you that what boston was looking for we could not provide them
66893 we could not provide them a major league ready outfielder to replace ramirez
66894 you just cant continue to give two or three guys for rental players
66895 youre going to need some of these young guys to fill in the needs for the roster for next year and at the same time for this year
66896 we just dont know that the fact of the matter is there were no starters on the market available the position players available some we didnt care for and some we did like them but they were rentals
66897 we talked to some teams but in the end there was no name guy there that was a difference maker
66898 we were looking for anything but something better than what we had if you look at the guys there really was not any relief guys traded except for kyle farnsworth going to the
66899 weve got bigger bodies weve got the look weve got all that stuff
66900 im not saying we didnt have that in the past but now weve got bigger guys that can run
66901 seeing him on tape he cant be blocked one on one by anybody hes going to command a double team even if you double him youre not guaranteed to stop him
66902 its his motor hes always going thats the kind of guy you want on the edge hes got a motor and its not going to stop
66903 hes an animal i look at him and say youre not that big but he weighs like 260 hes actually listed at 243 hes a big guy hes smart and hes getting better at making the checks
66904 you need a take no prisoners attitude and the mentality if they hit you you have to hit back all the time
66905 with this group we do we know how to attack
66906 pretty much theres no reason to go out there and be stupid
66907 but if i feel good maybe ill steal a few reps in that last preseason game
66908 and while jeremy helped me a lot last year this is how things are and i have to do my part immediately
66909 no man i dont even think about it now i gave it to him its his forever
66910 when i tell him to get in on the next two plays he takes the next three
66911 he is working hard and studying everything and i think he may be the most focused player on the team right now
66912 its just sore just something i want to prevent from basically going through what i went through last year i dont want to do that it was very frustrating what i went through i played pretty good but i know i can be a lot better
66913 you dont make too much of one game you move on and you do what you can tomorrow
66914 they are a terrific club they beat us about the same number of times weve beaten them

66924 its just raising a red flag to us that somethings not right with this

66934 really we dont know what is going to happen with that but i would think that they would scatter his ashes over the
66935 we were rolling down the highway 111 working our way to a deadline for an intense eight hours of repetition
66936 hey look at me ive got a humungous bowl on my head
66937 in the past we have had scout groups and other organized groups utilize the park with special agreements however the complaints we are now receiving appear to be that individuals are camping on the island without permission and keeping others from enjoying the park
66938 were not looking to cite people but we want people who use the islands to understand who manages the properties and what the rules are
66939 we need to ensure that all our visitors to these islands are able to enjoy their uniqueness
66940 the words national interest preface electric transmission corridor in nietc but the use is specious
66941 rather it is a special interest electric transmission corridor the result of special interests seeking to reshape the electricity regulatory structure to enrich their bottom lines
66942 i am concerned that the scope of the implementation and the potential overuse of the new federal power line siting authority go beyond the narrow backstop authority that the committee intended when it crafted the provision
66943 the mind set is to keep your head down and get these power lines up and get this over with
66944 the federal government can be very arrogant when it comes to policies that affect real people
66945 now theyve got a fight on their hands theyll certainly get a fight from me
66946 ugh you dont like gross fatty oil salt laden fast food anorexic
66947 id just come in to the house i still had my gloves on and i wasnt wearing my glasses my wife hollered from upstairs quick put the pistachio ice cream in the freezer before it melts it never occurred to me someone for whatever reason mightve left a stack of 100s on our kitchen table
66948 i dont know what this was about all i know is my cousins in a truck down there dead
66949 this is just terrible the violence is getting out of hand
66950 were very excited about the potential benefits of the williams real estate plans they will change the look of the community
66951 will help the curb appeal and encourage everyone to invest and move to uptown
66952 we didnt want surface parking lots we want businesses we think everything were doing is helping the neighborhood not hurting it
66953 he never called in sick he would always be at the office in a suit and tie and he always taught us any job worth doing is worth doing right
66954 you put your full effort in and you dont walk away until its finished
66955 if you were going down and no one let you out you were history and the other guy just couldnt do it
66956 woe be unto you if you werent there on time
66957 you dont appreciate it at the time but now as adults with our own families you see the value of a strong family upbringing like that
66958 he was so very proud of his home and family and his friends and neighbors
66959 if youre in your late 20s and youre still poor its ok
66960 you wont have to pay any taxes on the distributions
66961 i dont want that to sound terrible i actually did a lot of theater im a musical theater guy
66962 i make people feel like things are really going to work out
66963 you can succeed in life financially it doesnt mean you have to be uber wealthy my definition of wealthy is that at any point in time ill be able to walk away from my office and take a trip with my family and its not going to put any sort of strain on our finances does that mean i have 10 million no
66964 if you havent moved away from pittsburgh youre probably not appreciating it the way that you should be because you really dont know what its like outside
66965 i know that as my sons growing up there will be other kids like him who want to do the best that they can who have really sound morals and want to do the best for their families
66966 if you cant at the drop of a hat go out and blow 1 000 on drinks and dinner you werent part of the in crowd
66967 no matter what happened in my life i was always going to be able to provide for my family more than my mother could i know that she always wanted to provide more than what she could
66968 it has become clear to me that after the orchestrated politically inspired media event staged a few weeks ago that this campaign will ultimately be focused not on issues but on one unflattering photograph
66969 though i am innocent of these accusations against me i believe my continued presence in this state senate race will be a distraction
66970 have nothing to do with bonusgate they have nothing to do with bribery corruption misappropriation
66971 if you look at when these charges came down there is no reason at all why these charges could not have been deferred until after the election and allow the people to make their choice
66972 from the beginning of this campaign i have said that we need someone from outside the tired democratic political machine that supported mike veon and hand picked sean ramaley all that yesterdays announcement does is give that same set of back room political bosses the ability to change the name of their hand picked candidate and thats not the kind of change we need
66973 any time you have a tumult in a district it gives the opposition an opportunity for a pickup
66974 but how great an opportunity this is for republicans remains to be seen the republican situation is clearly better now than it was when sean ramaley was in the race and was not under indictment
66975 if you are elder vogel you would rather be running against an indicted sean ramaley than against a replacement democrat
66976 if he has to defend himself against such serious charges he wouldnt be able to represent the people in his district with the energy and time they deserve
66977 on who replaces him and how that person is chosen
66978 if the county committee chooses someone by a secretive process one without participation by ordinary democrats that creates its own problems
66979 there are some outstanding individuals who have expressed interest in running for the senate seat
66980 i believe the eventual democratic nominee will win in november
66981 we were surprised that we didnt have more people seriously injured and killed
66982 its a horrible tragic event but it could have been a hell of a lot worse
66983 we could not have done it as firefighters alone it took more people than we had it was organized it was pretty calm
66984 they had this huge advantage they werent crushed by steel
66985 listen you give me that paperwork for the johnson account by tomorrow or its your ass no mayo i said no mayo yeah thats right johnson account on my desk no pepperoncinis
66986 the parents will feed the babies until theyre totally feathered out
66987 by the time they leave the nest theyll be about the same size as the adults you know when people eat squab thats when they take em when theyre nice and plump
66988 you can see this white stuff glowing in the crops of the squabs
66989 theyll eat heavily then drink a lot of water to easily chuck up the grain
66990 and did you know pigeons drink like horses hens will lift their heads up to swallow but pigeons put their head down and just take a long draught
66991 if alls going along well with the first nest theyll build another right near by and lay the next batch
66992 theyll take turns sitting on the next set while the other feeds up the squabs
66993 they wont be professional in going after the best food
66994 the last time i accidently got some girl pregnant i got a dna test
66995 ive never been drunk i have never done recreational drugs just look at my 20 year career tell me someone who is into partying or doing drugs that could have done that view all archives
66996 the universe is telling me its all okay my days ahead will be colorful
66997 lets put people together and have em beat the shit out of eachother
66998 while we respect the passion of our teams in the spirit of competition we regret this incident occurred and are dedicated to averting a recurrence in the future
66999 obviously i handled this particular situation the wrong way and if i had to do it over again it never wouldve happened
67000 this is such a big race and it was disappointing
67001 the car is good but the tires are wearing out quick
67002 its going to be a 7 or 8 lap shootout
67003 well lose a lot of track position if we take four so we have to take right sides only during this stop
67004 we were good we just didnt have the track position needed to win at the end
67005 i am real proud of this team we had a strong weekend we were strong in each practice and we were strong in the race i hate that we had the issues with the tires
67006 as parents when our children are sick we will do anything to make sure they receive the best medical care in the world what i discovered and am reminded of each year as i visit the hospital is that undeniable level of care is available at riley
67007 i am extremely proud of our affiliation with riley hospital and grateful for this opportunity to help rileys outstanding medical and support staff by providing critical funding for their work
67008 jeff gordon is truly passionate about his commitment to children he shows that commitment through his financial support of riley hospital but as importantly he demonstrates it in the time and attention he gives to riley patients and to all children
67009 jeffs support comes from the heart as does our gratitude
67010 i cant say enough how sorry we are and its our responsibility being nascar that we dont go through this situation again
67011 the race didnt come off like we had hoped the fans didnt get what they exactly wanted and well do everything in our power it wont happen again i can tell you that much
67012 its obvious that we didnt go there with the right car slash tire combination
67013 we have to run the race and we have to run the safest race possible and when were in situations where we have to take control under adverse circumstances thats what we do
67014 to get ahead of it and have the safest race possible we had to take control and thats what we did run 10 to 11 laps at a time and let the cautions fly
67015 the problem is solely nascars and by that i mean its theirs to figure out
67016 its not going to come with anything we do to the track figuring it out will only come with getting the car and tire combination right and that requires actually spending the time and effort to do something about it
67017 the track wont change next year so if they want to come back they better figure it out because i dont think the fans want to come back and see that
67018 it hurts us whenever we have a weekend like we had
67019 theres nothing worse than coming away from a race and knowing the result was
67020 watkins glen and bristol are two tracks where i really want a win
67021 i enjoy racing on the road course at watkins glen and for some reason always seem to be a little better there than sonoma
67022 director anees bazmi was very clear that he wanted me to have an indian look for the song and what could have made me look more indian than a sari i thoroughly loved it a sari makes a woman look so graceful and feminine
67023 also in the song akshay imagines us dancing in the mysterious locales of egypt

67026 a discussion about mahabbah took place in makkah during the pilgrimage month the shaykhs who were present spoke about this matter and al junayd was the youngest of them they said to him o iraqi what do you have to say so he bowed his head and tears were flowing from his eyes then he said a servant should overcome his soul and be continuous in the remembrance of his lord establishing the rights of his lord focusing upon him with his heart the light of fear letting ablaze his heart whilst drinking from the vessel of true love and certain realities become unveiled for him so when he talks it is due to allaah when he speaks it is from allaah when he moves it is by the command of allaah and when he is serene then it is from allaah he belongs to allaah is for allaah and is with allaah so the shaykhs started to weep and said how can that be increased upon may allaah reward you with good o crown of the knowledgeable o nes

67100 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
67101 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
67102 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
67103 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
67104 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
67105 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
67106 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
67107 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
67108 about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
67109 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
67110 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
67111 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
67112 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
67113 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
67114 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
67115 i agree with it and im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying

67119 sudah minum susu jangan sampai lupa lo ini demi janinmu
67120 memang ibu hamil perlu makanan tambahan si ibu kan bukan cuma memberi makan dirinya tapi juga janinnya
67121 jadi bisa dibilang susu adalah makanan yang hampir sempurna hingga bisa dijadikan alternatif untuk mencukupi kebutuhan tambahan makanan bagi ibu hamil
67122 kekurangan zat besi akan membuat si ibu mengalami anemia dan mempengaruhi kecerdasan si janin
67123 pada sayuran dan kulit ari beras ada serat yang namanya asam fitat asam fitat inilah yang menghambat penyerapan dari kalsium itu
67124 bukankah bb yang meningkat juga berarti mengundang bahaya lain lagi
67125 tak mengapa kekurangannya itu diberikan dalam bentuk susu kita hitung makanan pokok yang masuk ada berapa dan kebutuhan dia seberapa lalu kita ambil selisihnya tentunya kebutuhan per individu ibu hamil tak sama tergantung bb dan tb si ibu bila dia butuh 2000 kkal misal sedangkan makanan yang masuk hanya 1000 kkal dan yang 1000 kkal nya lagi terbuang akibat muntah muntah nah kekurangannya ini bisa dipenuhi dengan susu
67126 jadi bila kebutuhan gizi si ibu kurang ya bayi juga bisa terkena bblr atau berat badan lahir rendah yang akan berdampak pada kualitas si bayi selanjutnya
67127 walaupun kalau dilihat dari pola makan ibu ibu di negara kita sebenarnya kekurangan asam folat ini jarang terjadi karena ibu ibu kita sering makan kacang kacangan seperti tempe dan tahu
67128 toh kandungannya tak beda dengan susu full cream biasa asalkan jangan yang skim karena berarti lemaknya sudah dibuang padahal lemak salah satu sumber energi pula
67129 susu kedelai mengandung asam fitat yang bisa menghambat penyerapan zat besi hingga zat besi yang banyak itu jadi tak berguna karena tetap tak terserap dengan bagus

67167 top officials are doing the negotiating with the thai side but we the soldiers are continuing to do our duty and remain on alert we are waiting for our orders
67168 i am excited to hear that both sides have agreed to withdraw their armed forces from the pagoda it eases tensions at the temple
67169 nach der sache am hockenheimring geht es mir wieder gut und ich freue mich wahnsinnig darauf endlich wieder zu fahren

67186 wenn in den eckkneipen 80 prozent der g ste rauchen und dort das rauchen zum trinken dazugeh rt dann ist ein rauchverbot existenzbedrohend wir m ssen meiner meinung nach die ausnahmeregelung auf die eckkneipen ausweiten
67187 wir hoffen dass nun der landesgesetzgeber von seinem gestaltungsspielraum gebrauch macht und die unterschiedlichen interessen von nichtrauchern rauchern und unternehmen angemessen ber cksichtigt

67194 ich w nschte sie w rden uns vor das tribunal in den haag rufen
67195 the garment sector is slower than in past years we fear that additional costs would lead factory owners move to other places
67196 the most valuable garment exports and textiles went to china while cambodia gained only workers salaries and factory rental fees
67197 once the ministry of labour implements the salary tax factory owners will have to pay us 0 80 for each worker this is a new cost for garment factory operators
67198 they have suffered with highly electricity costs low productivity and too many strikes
67199 i would encourage our workers to work hard to compete with china in vietnam and china people want to work because they want to make money
67200 it would be nice if the ministry allows only three unions
67201 look at china there are no unions people love working hard to make money
67202 buyers need cambodian goods to arrive at the market on time if goods do not arrive on time buyers will stop ordering from cambodia
67203 i think our garment sector for first half year of 2008 is not too bad because besides the us market we have exports to the eu market as well
67204 i think our garment sector is doing fine because we have expanded into the eu and canadian market

67211 leilas mutter mokko hat ihr fr hst ck heute stehen lassen und sucht berall nach ihrer tochter
67212 den unfall gestern hat sie nicht richtig mitbekommen das ging alles viel zu schnell aber nun sitzt sie zusammen mit ihrer dreieinhalbj hrigen tochter auf einem stein hat sich ein tuch ber den kopf gest lpt und trauert
67213 wie alle menschenaffen konnte sie nicht schwimmen und ging sofort unter
67214 au erdem hat sich das fell wie ein schwamm vollgesaugt und leila nach unten in den drei meter tiefen graben gezogen
67215 mit einer anzeige ist uns ja nicht geholfen unser affe ist tot das ist die schreckliche wahrheit wir sind einfach w tend dass der besucher die schilder mit dem f tterungsverbot missachtet hat
67216 in ein zwei jahren h tte leila sich fortpflanzen k nnen wir haben extra ein neues m nnchen f r sie gekauft
67217 dass sie gerade in der pubert t war hat sicherlich auch mit dem unfall zu tun wie jugendliche sind auch pubertierende affen etwas bermutig und trauen sich mehr zu als sie k nnen
67218 wir k mmern uns jetzt ganz besonders um die affen und beobachten ihr verhalten

67225 during my little sessions with him mendis i have found him to be a guy who learns things pretty quickly
67226 the batters around the world might work him out and pick him but i am sure hell keep improving hopefully hell be one step ahead of the batters all the time
67227 i feel it helps murali to be a little more attacking when the two of them are bowling together that creates a lot of pressure and some batsmen crumble under that pressure
67228 for murali its great to have someone like mendis around
67229 during the asia cup we spoke as to how murali bowled so well but mendis kept on picking up the wickets and during the first test it was the other way around
67230 both of them are match winners and exciting for sri lankan cricket
67231 we expect the second test to be a close game
67232 we are expecting india to come back hard they were under a lot of pressure and we expect them to fight hard in this test
67233 the quite ancient symbol of the ouroboros the serpent which consumes its own tail was a theme used for wedding rings made of iron in rome the ouroboros itself is a symbol of the oneness of creation and destruction in renewal and the life principle which timelessly feeds on its own inspiration it also represents the hope for a lifelong marriage union thats continually renewed
67234 in this way the wearing of a wedding ring on that finger signifies the public proclamation of the union in the daylight in other words the conscious and clearly visible world of human community this correspondence is perhaps even more strongly emphasized by the general tendency to craft wedding rings out of gold which is symbolically the metal of the sun throughout folk history and across cultures
67235 he reads from a large book originally known as the cosmic log chained to his right wrist which contains all past present and future events he does not leave footprints nor does he cast a shadow

67241 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
67242 he shot annapolis yesterday when he declared that there is no possibility of reaching an agreement by the end of the year he destroyed annapolis by declaring that jerusalem is not part of the discussion and today by this resignation probably hes providing the ammunition to kill finally the annapolis process completely olmert is finishing with failures but his biggest failure is that he has proven that up til now there is no partner for peace in israel
67243 it is decided not to ban the party the court decided to impose partial financial penalties the party will not be banned but everybody should evaluate the decision very carefully the decision should be accepted as a very strong warning for akp six court members voted yes four people voted for imposing financial penalties and one person voted for rejection of the case
67244 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
67245 similar to practices in other countries china is acting in accordance with its laws with regards to control of the internet according to chinese law the internet cannot be used to transmit information that is illegal such as promoting the evil cult falun gong or threatening national security so we hope that the media will respect chinese laws and regulations
67246 this is a major step towards serbias place in europe where the country belongs serbia now must face through this trial and through every next trial perhaps of hopefully of general ratko mladic soon to face everything that was done and undertaken in the name of the people of serbia including crimes atrocities and everything else
67247 the ecuadorian people do not want foreign troops on our soil and the government has to follow the mandate of its people
67248 we cant let little countries screw around with big companies like this companies that have made big investments around the world
67249 the mission is to enter gaza without passing through the territory of israel or egypt going from international waters directly into gaza it hasnt been done since 1967 and theres reason to think that no one will interfere with us if we go because israel has said that they no longer occupy gaza so we want to put it to the test

67352 at no time has the riverside county sheriffs department been denied access either to the casino or on the reservation and we have documentation to substantiate that fact
67353 i regret that it has come to this but to protect preserve and perpetuate an isolated pocket of lawlessness that causes fear in our neighboring communities within riverside county is simply not an option or sound public policy

67362 now we are talking about when foreign forces are going to cease their operations
67363 i think we have to wait until those negotiations finish to really know the details
67364 lower ratings mean the networks have less inventory to sell so they can charge more for it and if the demand is there then in many cases like this year there will be more money looking to buy ads than the networks can take in so they can bump up rates or threaten to shut out the advertisers
67365 as the digital media landscape continues to grow and change the transparency and accountability of audience measurement has never been more important
67366 our approach has always been focused on transparency and enabling the media industry to have greater insight and control over their audience data
67367 our participation in the mrc accreditation process is part and parcel of our commitment to deliver accurate and trusted data to our growing publisher and marketer
67368 stores no longer have the soul of the past and reflect a chain of stores vs the warm feeling of a neighborhood store
67369 the numbers are looking good and arbitron is focusing on problems where they need to be
67370 we dont believe mrc accreditation is necessary as long as they are still aggressively pursuing it
67371 its time to move forward with electronic measurement for radio
67372 radio broadcasters and advertisers are taking bold steps in an effort to enhance the accountability of the medium the radio advertising bureau recently published guidelines for posting and ad schedule guarantees and the american association of advertising agencies continues to advance its e business effort project reinvention the arbitron ppm is uniquely capable of delivering the granularity precision and speed of reporting that can help radio make these and other accountability initiatives a success
67373 we have improved our ppm samples in the four key areas we outlined last november we have enhanced our ability to deliver ppm sample targets weve improved the composition of our ppm panels especially among the 18 34 demographic weve raised the day to day cooperation rate of our ppm respondents weve also put in place a number of programs designed to have a positive impact on response rates our commitment to continuous improvement means that we will keep working on these metrics as we go forward
67374 in the past weeks we have been meeting with our clients to review the progress that weve made since november and to hear their priorities for enhancements to our ppm services our conclusion from these meetings is that our ppm ratings are valid and the time is right for electronic measurement another outcome from these meetings is that we have established working groups across a number of constituencies within the radio industry to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the implementation of our continuous improvement programs for the ppm at the same time we are working diligently with the media rating council in order to achieve mrc accreditation for all our ppm markets
67375 we are also seeing that radio operators who have embraced ppm are benefiting from ppm measurement over the past few months there have been numerous reports in the trade press about urban and general market broadcasters who have successfully harnessed ppm ratings to advance their programming and sales efforts we should not continue to let other media use their more advanced measurement systems to take audience and revenue away from radio
67376 what do you call 10 dead lawyers at the bottom of the ocean a good start
67377 even with the advent of mp3 players consumers are still largely turning to radio for their music needs as it is easily accessible and free
67378 popularity of mp3 players and digital records hasnt pushed listeners completely away from radio
67379 this new description is strictly geared toward the radio advertising community to better align us with our function and audience delivery
67380 listeners still identify positively with that description but in agencies we feel smooth ac is a better way to describe the format
67381 these days our station is more mainstream and mass appeal than it was years ago
67382 ducoty says they the council have yet to come down on either side whether to support a restart of the roll out contrary to mondays inside radio but he adds the consensus is in favor of ppm we want to see it out there as quickly as possible
67383 i didnt think much of the ad game through my career but it is now changing from a sleazy art form to a measurable science

67386 we felt part of our mission was the reflect back to our audience a vision of what they could be
67387 my dreams were pretty big for hockey and i have to tell you most of them were fulfilled
67388 but someone drops the puck someone hits you in the face there are not any more nerves theres no place out here to just kind of shake them

67391 i seemed to have a 5 iron or 6 iron in my hand all day and i made three or four really poor swings on the back

67404 our relations with your country thailand south korea with japan and china have never been stronger

67409 i will also remind people that i will be sprinting to the finish that i will finish this job strong
67410 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the united states did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible

67416 typical well adjusted teenagers will run away from home and some of our residents are vastly more prone to do that
67417 the social workers and sheriffs department are more trained at how to find the people than we are all the reports are filed the paperwork is done there is a standard process
67418 theyll get stopped somewhere and their info will be run most of the people at this glory home are not residents nine times out of 10 they will return home in a day or two these are not routine runaways

67578 it wouldnt do us any good to catch more lobster because if we do itll drive down the prices even more
67579 it hasnt been good for the lobster industry and it may get worse

67609 the united states cannot conduct an effective long term counterterrorism campaign against al qaida or other terrorist groups without understanding how terrorist groups end
67610 the term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important because it affects what kinds of forces you use
67611 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
67612 the united states has the necessary instruments to defeat al qaida it just needs to shift its strategy and keep in mind that terrorist groups are not eradicated overnight

67729 contar con instituciones de esta naturaleza para que se preocupen de la calidad alimentaria en chile y para el extranjero es un gran paso que vamos a dar
67730 lo primero es detectar la situaci n tomar las medidas de control que se est n tomando acotar el tema luego vendr n aquellas sanciones que eventualmente pudieran tener lugar lo importante es solucionar los temas asegurar la tranquilidad de la poblaci n y asegurar la confianza que chile tiene y ha adquirido en el mundo
67731 para que chile pueda contar con una instancia preocupada de la calidad de los alimentos porque eso es lo que todos los pa ses de gran desarrollo en el mundo han ido instalando en sus propias estructuras institucionales y eso es parte de la industrializaci n que chile requiere en esta materia
67732 chile est a la altura de los pa ses desarrollados cuando est dispuesto a asumir estos desaf os por lo tanto vamos avanzando y contar con instituciones de esta naturaleza para que se preocupe de la calidad alimentaria en chile y para el extranjero es un gran paso que vamos a dar

67736 no se va a permitir que ning n establecimiento que tenga cerdos pertenezca o no pertenezca a la organizaci n sean alimentados con aceites o con alg n tipo de elemento que pudieran causar da o que eventualmente pudiera ser la causal
67737 yo quedo tranquilo de lo que se est haciendo porque se est protegiendo y se est velando para que los consumidores no sufran consecuencias no solamente ahora sino que no las vuelvan a sufrir ni en la potencialidad hacia el futuro que los productores que est n haciendo un trabajo notable y est n constituyendo en la exportaci n de cerdo por ejemplo una nueva fuente econ mica para chile contin e pero que la imagen internacional en temas zoo y fitosanitarios quede resguardada

67759 trabajamos en una l nea de investigaci n que se conoce como neurociencia computacional cuyo objetivo es la construcci n de modelos computacionales para poder explicar y predecir el funcionamiento del cerebro en concreto nos centramos en desarrollar modelos y teor as acerca del procesamiento de la informaci n tanto en el sistema somatosensorial como en el sistema visual
67760 esta relaci n se ala cudeiro es fundamental para entender c mo funciona el cerebro dado que la actividad cerebral depende en cada momento del aporte del flujo sangu neo en cada rea activada para entender su importancia no hay m s que pensar en los trastornos que aparecen cuando una zona del cerebro queda privada de ox geno como en el caso de un ictus o en que las modernas t cnicas de estudio de la funci n cerebral la pet o la resonancia magn tica funcional se basan en dicha relaci n

67764 en uno de los ltimos trabajos en los que particip nuestro grupo apunta pombal inyectamos una sustancia que provoca la muerte de las c lulas dopamin rgicas tal y como hab a sido ya comprobado en otras especies reproduciendo as la alteraci n celular implicada en la enfermedad de p rkinson por lo tanto ahora tenemos la posibilidad de provocar la p rdida de esas c lulas en las lampreas y analizar c mo afectan a su movimiento
67765 nos interesa saber c mo funcionan la neuronas individualmente excitabilidad celular y para ello estudiamos las corrientes i nicas que permiten a una determinada neurona ser y comportarse de forma diferente a cualquier otra tambi n nos interesa conocer c mo esa personalidad propia de cada neurona modifica el comportamiento del sistema ya que las neuronas en el sistema nervioso siempre est n en contacto con muchas otras proporcionando y recibiendo informaci n
67766 ha estado a la altura no s lo de la que se lleva a cabo en nuestro pa s sino que es reconocida internacionalmente desafortunadamente los grupos de investigaci n son pocos y la financiaci n escasa sin embargo el nivel de calidad de nuestra investigaci n no tiene mucho que envidiar al que se realiza en otros pa ses

67925 sort of back in the day when surveyors ruled the battlefield the communicators never put us on the call sign lists the firing batteries all had call signs the supply guys had call signs forward observers infantry platoons even the chaplains jeep driver all had their own assigned alpha numeric code that changed every twelve hours or on command but not surveyors so we got tagged i was the man jones which evolved into tango mike juliet inside our battalion or echo four later five juliet for regimental traffic
67926 helmets and flack jackets these coins are batteries of howitzers they lob shells a long way and can fire over mountains like the bag here your stapler is a large convoy on the move and all the batteries have to compute different firing solutions to try to hit it without survey the commanders of each battery have to make their best guess map spot and could easily be off hundreds of meters or more if they or the map is off in the desired scenario the surveyors have already gone through and measured then staked out each battery position as well as providing another stake defining a known direction which means that the batteries are all within inches of where they think they are on the map and share a common grid and azimuth relationship now if the forward observers up on the crest of the mountain correctly locate and describe the target the batteries will have effect without having to shoot a bunch of adjustment rounds

67957 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
67958 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
67959 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
67960 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
67961 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short

68020 we did this after the arabs started this week to build an illegal structure on the spot this is after the municipality has already demolished a structure on this property once before
68021 in a lot of the plots i find arabs are living and building illegally and also working the jnf land without permission
68022 during the years of the intifada the municipality had difficulty carrying out the necessary level of enforcement in the neighborhoods of eastern jerusalem due to security constraints
68023 whoever thinks its possible to live with 270 000 arabs in eastern jerusalem must take into account that there will be more bulldozers more tractors and more cars carrying out terror attacks
68024 whoever thinks the problem of jerusalem and terror are specific and that destroying one house or another will help is burying his head in the sand the main question is does the government want jerusalem arab neighborhoods of jebl mukaber or sur bahir as part of israel or not

68034 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
68035 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

68038 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
68039 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

68105 el comit ol mpico internacional y el comit organizador de pek n para los juegos ol mpicos deber an cumplir su compromiso con la libertad completa para los medios de comunicaci n y proporcionar acceso inmediato y sin censura a internet en las instalaciones para la prensa de los juegos la censura de internet en estos juegos pone en peligro derechos humanos fundamentales y traiciona los valores ol mpicos
68106 lamento que al parecer el bocog ha anunciado ahora que habr limitaciones en el acceso a sitios web durante la celebraci n de los juegos tengo entendido tambi n que algunos funcionarios del coi negociaron con los chinos que se bloquear an algunos sitios conflictivos porque no se consideraban relacionados con los juegos
68107 esta flagrante censura de los medios de comunicaci n a ade una promesa rota m s que debilita la afirmaci n de que los juegos contribuir an a mejorar los derechos humanos en china
68108 el nuevo gobierno de pakist n deber revelar de inmediato d nde se encuentran recluidas los centenares de personas que est n en paradero desconocido v ctimas de desaparici n forzada investigar todos los casos y hacer rendir cuentas a los responsables incluidos los servicios de inteligencia y seguridad del estado
68109 el primer ministro yusuf raza gilani ha hecho hincapi en el compromiso el gobierno de coalici n con la necesidad de hacer valer los derechos humanos ha manifestado sam zarifi director del programa para asia y ocean a de amnist a internacional le instamos a que tome de inmediato medidas para resolver todos los casos de desaparici n
68110 como primera medida el nuevo gobierno debe aliviar el sufrimiento de los familiares de los
68111 no sabemos si las personas objeto de desaparici n forzada son culpables o inocentes ha se alado sam zarifi pero es esencial respetar su derecho a ser acusadas y juzgadas debidamente ante un tribunal de justicia
68112 con la detenci n de personas en secreto el gobierno de pakist n no s lo viola los derechos de los detenidos sino que tambi n incumple su deber de presentar cargos contra los presuntos responsables de ataques contra civiles y juzgarlos
68113 no quiero ni siquiera contestar a ello es absurdo no me lo creo no es verdad

68115 al seguir persiguiendo y castigando a quienes se pronuncian en favor de los derechos humanos las autoridades chinas han perdido de vista las promesas que formularon cuando se les concedieron los juegos ol mpicos hace siete a os

68117 la cuenta atr s para los juegos ol mpicos promesas incumplidas
68118 daremos a los medios de comunicaci n libertad total para informar cuando vengan a china estamos convencidos de que la concesi n de los juegos a china no s lo promover nuestra econom a sino que tambi n mejorar todos los problemas sociales incluidos la educaci n la salud y los derechos humanos
68119 nos satisface que el coi reconozca de su papel en materia de derechos humanos pero dada la realidad actual nos sorprende su confianza en que los medios de comunicaci n extranjeros podr n informar libremente y en que no habr censura de internet
68120 y el coi debe pronunciarse cuando las autoridades violan los principios ol mpicos generales
68121 adem s los dirigentes mundiales que asistan a los juegos deben alzar p blicamente la voz en favor de los derechos humanos en china y deben apoyar a los activistas individuales de derechos humanos de china si no lo hacen transmitir n el mensaje de que es aceptable que un gobierno sea anfitri n de los juegos ol mpicos en una atm sfera de represi n y persecuci n

68126 la reciente propuesta de hacer extensivo este censo a toda la poblaci n italiana de aqu a 2010 no cambia nada las cosas si como han declarado las autoridades italianas mientras tanto se sigue con el roman
68127 el consejo de seguridad de la onu debe revisar el plazo l mite y arbitrario de 2010 establecido para que el tribunal para la ex yugoslavia complete sus causas

68130 el trato infligido a omar khadr durante su detenci n viola las obligaciones contra das por estados unidos en virtud del derecho internacional que establece que en todas las acciones relativas a menores el inter s superior del menor debe ser la consideraci n principal
68131 estados unidos ha violado las normas internacionales al negarse a reconocer la condici n de menor de omar khadr y tratarlo de acuerdo con ella
68132 ning n detenido que fuera menor en el momento de su presunto delito debe ser juzgado por comisiones militares que no cuentan con disposici n alguna respecto a la justicia de menores
68133 omar khadr debe ser repatriado y juzgado en canad por un tribunal ordinario o de lo contrario ser puesto en libertad
68134 es un buen primer paso hacia la rendici n de cuentas por los abusos contra los derechos humanos que tuvieron lugar durante la cumbre del g8 en g nova pero es preciso hacer m s para garantizar que emerge toda la verdad y que los responsables responden plenamente de sus actos
68135 el rendimiento de cuentas por los abusos cometidos por agentes estatales incluidos los funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley debe ser la norma las autoridades italianas deben poner en pr ctica las recomendaciones de los rganos y organizaciones internacionales pertinentes a este respecto para impedir que hechos as se repitan en el futuro

68142 have you ever wondered why we dont have a hotel within the confines of the air force academy grounds
68143 it got airborne and then the right wing went down and it dove into the ground and disappeared
68144 the downwind would cause the airplane to move faster over the ground
68145 they just tried to see if they could find somebody and help people
68146 they were calling out to see if they could find anyone they saw bodies
68147 we know there were lots of people in the area when this incident occurred
68148 officers have already taken information from many of those present but we are still asking anyone who thinks they may know something that will assist us with our enquiries to come forward

68150 i have written a wicked book and feel as spotless as the lamb
68151 methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air
68152 it is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation
68153 better to sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian
68154 i read a writers almanac on the internet every morning and am very grateful to be able to do so
68155 about time i paid for listening to and reading the writers almanac besides i could do with another mug
68156 i read the writers almanac every single day send bits of it to friends save quotes in my archives i am inspired by the struggles of people of the past and adore hearing the historical truth behind the legends of the great and the unsung it has become part of the days beginning
68157 my husband and i enjoy reading the writers almanac daily and value what it adds to our lives
68158 i love the writers almanac and garrison keillor although im at work and dont get to hear garrisons voice every day i receive the e mail versions so that 5 minutes is an essential part of my daily life
68159 as a writer ive enjoyed the writers almanac as a source of inspiration and enlightenment for years

68167 you should expect significant proposals from governors certainly for spending cuts probably for more tax increases and certainly for more gimmicks
68168 all courts should discourage litigation before trial that seems to seek to delay the commencement of trials
68169 allowing such pre trial litigation will often place prosecutors between a rock and a hard place
68170 they must on the one hand resist preliminary challenges to their investigations and to the institution of proceedings against accused persons on the other hand they are simultaneously obliged to ensure the prompt commencement of trials
68171 generally disallowing such litigation would ensure that the trial court decides the pertinent issues which it is best placed to do and would ensure that trials start sooner rather than later
68172 i conclude that the warrants in question were neither too vague nor too broad instead considered on their face value at the time of their issue they were reasonably intelligible to both the searcher and the searched
68173 finally zuma and thint have not pointed to any specific item that should not have been seized despite their knowing since 2006 which items were seized
68174 foreigners must respect chinese laws while in china and must not harm chinas national security or damage social order
68175 foreign students like to stay out all night on the weekend but in more intellectual and traditional chinese households there is no way the kids would go out like that
68176 a 1time aircraft departed from cape town international airport about 7 05pm on its way to oliver tambo international it returned to cape town international airport at 8pm
68177 lightning never leaves any real structural damage there is a burn mark and an exit mark
68178 street photography often tends to be ironic and can be distanced from its subject matter and often concentrates on a single human moment caught at a decisive or poignant moment on the other hand much street photography takes the opposite approach and provides a very literal and extremely personal rendering of the subject matter giving the audience a more visceral experience of walks of life they might only be passingly familiar with
68179 just be yourself and act naturally dont be sneaky or overly
68180 this is a legitimate bid i wasnt going to bid 1 i offered 1 per foot for the 145 foot long bridge plus 5 to show them that im not a cheapskate
68181 they put money in the budget for demolishing and removing the bridge if theres a successful bid to buy the bridge that money goes to the buyer to be used for dismantling and removal in this case the budget is 70 000
68182 the railroad bought the land in the 1830s and put in their track

68186 the film is damn near a masterpiece lets hope we dont have to wait so long to see what korine will do next
68187 korines latest film mister lonely is no different but this film has a sweetness that has rarely if ever been present in his previous work
68188 what to make of it all hard to say just to take in the fact that its soundtrack is made up of music by both j spaceman and sun city girls is to understand that this is a picture thats divided against itself in a way thats perhaps too hermetic to be comprehended
68189 korine is finding his way toward artistic greatness by searching his soul its possible that the man in the mirror is him
68190 mister lonely self enclosed though it may be nonetheless demonstrates that mr

68211 we dont have very many witnesses and we have very general vague descriptions of the suspects
68212 you could be looking at felony assault if not manslaughter or murder
68213 i guess thats why boxing floors are suspended and padded
68214 and i dont know what the protection is other than to stay out of harms way
68215 i guess the message is that you have to remember the broad spectrum of results from just winding up and hitting someone you could be killing them or wrecking them forever
68216 we need to play well at home especially this point in the season against a team within our division thats in front of us
68217 it was very important to win this series all the games seemed to be emotional i wouldnt quite call it a playoff atmosphere but it was pretty close
68218 its going to be tough its going to come down to the wire we know that
68219 we get to start over tomorrow thats whats great about this game we get to put this one away and pretend it didnt happen
68220 and god said let there be light and there was light
68221 and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night

68235 i felt a tug on my leg rope but a wave picked me up and washed me back to the beach i was totally freaked out
68236 were being very thoughtful about how we are going to do this so it truly gives us correct answers
68237 people are becoming more tuned into this issue and we want to address this up and coming concern
68238 i think its an important acknowledgement that we have a problem
68239 high time that dhec started testing the people who eat mercury contaminated fish

68245 well i think we can just end it it looks good
68246 what are these why cant you just use a pinch or a handful
68247 using a pastry blender or cutting the cold butter with two knives so that the flour and butter mixture looks like course meal
68248 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
68249 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
68250 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
68251 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
68252 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
68253 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
68254 i know its not fashionable these days to worry about individual rights but im from the old school
68255 the city is in no way doing the bidding of mr landy
68256 i just told the city hey im spending all this money and youre not protecting my location
68257 lets go you got about 10 seconds to get out there

68261 to our regret we discovered after our report was released that u s environmental protection agencys monitoring data for south carolina were incorrect
68262 we continue to stress that these numbers have been wrong our concern remains how does the rest of the country get this revised information the misinformation may remain in peoples minds how do we correct that misimpression
68263 the message we want to get out is if you have a gun youre done
68264 there are lots of false starts where the band cant get it together
68265 a popula o aumentou consideravelmente em raz o da vinda de muitas fam lias na maioria homens em busca de trabalho nas mineradoras

68267 you can learn a lot about a community from its manhole covers
68268 its a positive reflection of student aptitude and how schools work to develop it
68269 i think it certainly is an indicator of how well a school is doing academically and athletically
68270 is roken en drinken tegelijk beter dan alleen roken of drinken
68271 zeker voor rokers is het belangrijk om die twee glazen te drinken de risicoreductie die de alcohol veroorzaakt is voor hen nog belangrijker juist omd t ze al zon risico lopen
68272 elke sigaret geeft direct een verhoogde neiging tot stolselvorming trombose en roken leidt op lange termijn tot ontsteking en verstijving van de wand van bloedvaten
68273 het vernauwt de bloedvaten kan leiden tot een hersenbloeding of een hartinfarct en natuurlijk tot allerlei kankers het is helaas voor de rokers niet zo dat alcohol die effecten teniet doet
68274 in bloed zit goed cholesterol hdl en slecht cholesterol ldl
68275 hdl zorgt ervoor dat het cholesterol in het bloed wordt opgeruimd alcohol verhoogt dit effect
68276 drink je meer dan zorgt het onder meer voor een verhoogde bloeddruk leverproblemen en verkeersongelukken
68277 maar twee glazen betekent twee glazen van 30 cc en dus geen halve liters

68283 de emancipatie van homos nog niet afgerond is het gaat om een authentieke strijd om vrijheid en gelijkheid dat raakt mij persoonlijk
68284 doordat hij het als een popster al lang van tevoren heeft aangekondigd heeft hij andere politici en bedrijven over de streep getrokken
68285 ik heb plasterk gebruikt als argument in de boardroom toen het erover ging of tnt het evenement zou gaan sponsoren
68286 dat plasterk daar ook meevaart kan bij het gros van de bevolking de indruk wekken dat hij juist op d t aspect een ministerieel stempel van goedkeuring zet daardoor kan zijn deelname als een boemerang op homos werken
68287 hij is dus niet alleen bij de extravaganza maar ook bij de loodzware discussies en de nette pakken

68303 the censor board had raised an objection to the cross dangling around my bustline they said this might hurt the sentiments of orthodox christians censored i explained to them that unlike other people i dont wear it as a fashion statement but because i believe in it then i asked them to explain to me where the cross should dangle as per their guidelines they had no answer and instead asked to cover the cross with some effect my editor at prime focus made the cross look like a sparkling solitaire anyways after the zillion cuts the video has been given a u a certificate i am super excited as now the outrageously chopped video can be aired on disney and pogo as well
68304 all the kinds of things you take for granted from an online media perspective you cant do on tv you want to change out an ad it takes days you want to change weighting or targeting and switch to a different type of audience its pretty difficult it was my one foray into the tv space after spending 10 years online and i felt ready to come back
68305 its certainly a challenging advertising market for some right now my assumption is that many papers are largely selling to local advertisers what quadrantone offers is the ability to take their local content these audience and the ability to localize the message for national advertisers and national advertisers get this type of media youre talking about people checking out local news i dont have the data in front of me but the engagement on these sites is substantially higher that will make a difference
68306 were going to continue with what i consider to be an intelligent affiliate strategy the best thing i can do with my time and as we expand the business is bring on more national advertisers were going to double the size of the ad sales team within the next four to six weeks keep in mind this is a company thats only 140 days old so theres only five or six sales people 10 altogether including support the way it works is the better i do for my affiliates the more affiliates ill ultimately have

68310 we expect they will try again to imprison shabanov and we will try again to get him freed
68311 hes not guilty they are doing this solely because he is a christian
68312 we regard this as a first victory but there is still much struggle ahead to free hamid
68313 hamid spoke up in court to declare that he was not guilty but they are one team the police the prosecutors and the judge
68314 were very unhappy we want hamid vindicated and freed but they dont want to free him
68315 the proceedings are not objective the whole case is a charade theyre holding him now at the police station as if hes a terrorist
68316 hasanov called me an english spy who acts only for money
68317 he demanded in a threatening manner that i should not return to zakatala stop helping local baptists and that i should abandon my faith
68318 he also told me that there is a special instruction not to allow baptists to function in zakatala district
68319 i doubt that it comes from the president if it exists it must be from the local administration
68320 this is our state you do your job and well do ours
68321 shabanovs native language is georgian and he studied in georgia
68322 he is therefore very weak in azeri and finds reading it difficult especially when it is in the latin script

68328 we are calling for a much needed overhaul of the protections offered by the human rights commission system
68329 we have to ensure that commissions do not become abusers of the very human rights they are charged with protecting

68347 hace dos semanas la mal llamada media luna decidi trasladar los conflictos sociales al occidente no aceptan que un campesino sea presidente aqu no es problema de capitalidad de recursos sino que se resisten a perder sus privilegios imag nense c mo manipulan desde all del oriente y siento que algunos sectores y dirigentes se prestan a eso
68348 podr equivocarse en algunas cosas pero jam s habr traiciones en la lucha antiimperialista

68537 helen and betty could not be more different in their perspectives of the destitute people that live around them when helen the old sister hears the story of the good samaritan she is rewarded for her classroom achievements while the other sister chooses to live the example of the good samaritan as helen lives for herself and is constantly worried about the opinions of others betty searches for ways to be a blessing to others when faced with the realities of living the life of the good samaritan helen reveals the treachery of her own heart as she mercilessly withholds good from a dirty street urchin this is a story that reaches the heart especially when you read how helen responds to unexpected mercy and forgiveness she did not deserve

68575 we returned viz vitae to the race course after a severe tendon injury
68576 in the case of viz vitae he would have been retired
68577 when you have these injuries the tendons infill with scar tissue which is inflexible and the tendon no longer has its mechanical power generating capacity
68578 what were trying to do is return a fully functioning tendon by regrowing the tendon cells and return it to its normal function
68579 people arent willing to spend thousands of us dollars to repair a 5 cat or dog
68580 the principle is very simple but the cost is very high
68581 early results to date in terms of returning injured horses to the racetrack have been nothing short of stunning
68582 this horse suggests to us at lindsay park that no matter how severe the tendon injury stem cells promise a complete regeneration of the damaged tissue
68583 the stem cells promise to speed those repairs but trying to keep these horses immobilised for a long time is very very difficult

68730 is that the patriot is proud of his country for what it does and the nationalist is proud of his country no matter what it does the first attitude creates a feeling of responsibility but the second a feeling of blind arrogance that leads to war

68734 im thinking about killing michael moore and im wondering if i could kill him myself or if i would need to hire somebody to do it no i think i could
68735 we need to execute people like john walker in order to physically intimidate liberals by making them realize that they can be killed too
68736 i dont see any difference between arianna huffington and the nazis

68742 do i think that they actually believe this sometimes sure sometimes not it doesnt matter

68744 see it turns out that when you said all that shit people were listening jim d adkisson was listening
68745 while many evangelicals celebrated cassie bernall and rachel scott as martyrs who died for their christian convictions at columbine high school i wonder if we will extend the same heroism to the victims in tennessee
68746 we ought to find the people who are doing this take them out and shoot them really you take them out they are traitors to this country and shoot them you have a problem with that deal with it you shoot them you call them traitors thats what they are and you shoot them dead ill pay for the bullets
68747 how about you take mark dice out and put him in the middle of a firing range tie him to a post dont blindfold him let it rip and have some fun with mark dice
68748 i think that the mother killing the two children in south carolina vividly reminds every american how sick the society is getting and how much we need to change things the only way to change is to vote republican
68749 im thrilled about finding these long lost online blackjack documents with the letters notes and works from the once defunct uhlich pyrdum memorial library we can really get a better grasp on the online blackjack network that proceeded its modern day equivalent
68750 we all agreed that these items are best left open for all in the long haul we really would not have made that much money on licensing them anyway and this way students and historians in the online blackjack field can use them for further research and studies
68751 this is a great moment in the history of the towlerton tuffey memorial libary and trust we finally have some authentic documents to add to our collection on the development of the online blackjack economy and industry but also have the ability to share them with the rest of the world and anyone who has a strong interest in learning more about online blackjack
68752 were all please by these recent developments and cant wait until glisson reitzel online blackjack llc the selected restoration firm gets to work putting these papers into digital form
68753 and once this is done we can begin searching through them for various hidden online blackjack gems
68754 this is an area that not that long ago was a zone that nobody could move freely in
68755 we see our aussie friends doing a great job here
68756 our aggressive patrolling coupled with international security assistance force air and ground support pushed the insurgents onto the defensive
68757 if you can come to terms with the reasons for committing this despicable crime you can free yourself from your anger and resentment long before you walk from jail
68758 we are of the view that it would be singularly unwise to be committing australian men and women into theatres of operation without a clear understanding why we are going there what and how we are seeking to achieve it and when the job is done and when the men and women are coming home
68759 it would just be bad bad policy to do that
68760 in the first case a 39 year old female taking 50mg a day of vitamin b6 for three months developed a feeling of burning pain and
68761 she was also taking a multivitamin product containing vitamin b6 and therefore her total daily dose most likely exceeded the upper level of intake of 50mg a day recommended by national guidelines
68762 all patients should be advised of the risks associated with excessive doses of vitamins
68763 the problem is people do not tend to think about the dangers of the pills theyre putting in their mouth or whether theyre taking too much and sometimes those recommending them dont either
68764 i am pleased that our stockholders have followed the recommendation of the eds board of directors and supported the combination of eds and hp

68766 we have an integration team in place who will sort out the details in due course
68767 i think the local derby tends to make a great game whether youre going good or bad but both teams are travelling very well this season
68768 both probably expect to win the game and this time around its probably a top four battle
68769 we could probably upset our season if we lose or grab a bit of confidence by beating them
68770 im pretty happy for us to cruise by and let the other teams get talked about
68771 it doesnt really bother us we can just sit in the background and hopefully creep up on a few teams
68772 the stats show that the games are always very close and we dont expect it to be any different
68773 there is always a lot of feeling taken into the games because there is a fair bit of history there
68774 that was probably one of the worst nights of the year for the guys
68775 it would have been an entertaining game to watch but it wasnt that good being on the losing side
68776 its still fresh in our memories and its good motivation for the weekend
68777 everyone was ripping on defence and these tough wins are always the best ones
68778 in rugby league momentum is real important and if we can get a couple of wins together we can really ride that
68779 ive found with the warriors that once we get on a roll were hard to stop and thats what were looking to do again
68780 i feel i have something to offer and im looking forward to playing my part in the continuing rise of the club
68781 ive enjoyed the time ive spent at the club so far
68782 im really enjoying working with the young people here at souths and there is a good energy about the place
68783 everyone in this government is responsible for a string of failures we must let the people decide through new elections
68784 we are not worried by the change in israeli prime minister because we know that israel is seriously engaged to remain involved in the negotiation process with the palestinians
68785 hitched its fate to the possibility of achieving an agreement by the end of the year
68786 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate i will then prove my innocence
68787 the olmert who spoke yesterday from the garden of his compound in jerusalem was a crushed and battered man tainted by allegations lacking public trust or a sympathetic ear
68788 this government has finished its mission irrespective of who will head kadima
68789 you were a person in a position of trust you were a person these girls turned to for instruction on how to succeed at riding

68791 is a matter entirely within the control of the agencies involved
68792 from a credibility perspective the issue is who is making these decisions about disclosure and publication and on what criteria
68793 for the record the afp has provided full details of all its holdings including all classified material to the clarke inquiry
68794 the actual 2009 deficit could climb still higher because the new projection does not reflect full funding for the wars
68795 we make no apologies for the money we have spent to protect the people of this country
68796 both parties agree that even with a larger deficit that that plan was needed in order for it to have an impact to help pull us out of the downturn that weve been in
68797 is likely to scramble the plans of the next president regardless of which candidate prevails
68798 either republican john mccain or democrat barack obama will enter the white house in a tide of red ink
68799 mccain economic advisers this morning shrugged off the new deficit figures
68800 it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
68801 while barack obama is the biggest celebrity in the world
68802 that doesnt do much to help american families who need relief from high gas prices today or answer the question of whether hes ready to lead
68803 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to offshore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama
68804 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
68805 would raise energy costs by the same amount over the next 12 years since they have identical short term emissions goals

68808 i can tell you that what boston was looking for we could not provide them
68809 we could not provide them a major league ready outfielder to replace ramirez
68810 you just cant continue to give two or three guys for rental players
68811 youre going to need some of these young guys to fill in the needs for the roster for next year and at the same time for this year
68812 we just dont know that the fact of the matter is there were no starters on the market available the position players available some we didnt care for and some we did like them but they were rentals
68813 we talked to some teams but in the end there was no name guy there that was a difference maker
68814 we were looking for anything but something better than what we had if you look at the guys there really was not any relief guys traded except for kyle farnsworth going to the
68815 ill tell him dont ever say no to your wife
68816 im grateful to be able to give back to the community
68817 hes given us a lot of trouble over the years as a team so maybe a lot of people will like to see him gone
68818 hes a great hitter so im glad we dont have to face him anymore
68819 he can go to the other league thats all right
68820 not too many players leave there happy its been very well documented over the years i think back to mo vaughn and nomar garciaparra it goes on and on
68821 when theyre ready to get rid of a player they do it
68822 the best 3 4 guys in the league since 2003
68823 when youve got a good lineup and you get two guys of that ability it makes them tough it makes them who theyve been
68824 youre not going to find too many teams that can put two guys like that in the lineup back to back when those guys are both in the lineup and healthy that team has been successful
68825 i mean i know manny beats us up bad and i know mannys a great player
68826 it sure changes their lineup but theyve got a good lineup jason bays a pretty good player too im not sure theres a big drop off there
68827 they felt like they had to take care of a problem
68828 it started getting to be too much theyve never been afraid to trade guys or let guys go when they felt it was a way to better their team
68829 i came here to win im always going to be like that
68830 he understands what its like in a sense to be a yankee hes excited about being a yankee and what lies before us and the challenges
68831 for me its hard to believe that i am talking to you guys in yankee stadium and wearing a yankees uniform but i am happy
68832 molina is one of the premier backups in the game today he stepped up and did a tremendous job holding the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorge
68833 we needed to upgrade in terms of protection against injury in terms of offense i think its a significant acquisition for us
68834 im not the one making decisions im here just to play when joe puts me in the lineup i just feel happy about the job ive been doing ive been proud of myself for giving this team what they needed at the time jorge went down
68835 i made some phone calls and threw some ideas out but we werent really close to anything
68836 if there was something that made sense i would have done it it just came down to what people wanted
68837 im ready to rock and roll if we could match up with somebody we just couldnt match value for value in the marketplace
68838 if i find something a week from now or a month from now im ready to go if were comfortable with it
68839 hes pitching himself into the mix no doubt about it
68840 i think thats too much it was one pitch one mistake
68841 you always want to make a good impression with your new team but i dont have to do too much because there are great players behind me
68842 i view this as me trying to help this team try to win a world series
68843 were not going to look ahead but at the same time they wouldnt have traded for me if that wasnt the goal
68844 i got to face josh beckett one of the best players in baseball
68845 you lose jorge posada who i thought was a smart switch hitting catcher and you get pudge who has 14 all stars
68846 i dont run on anybody so i definitely wont run on pudge

68853 farmers are not fooled by mrs arroyos rhetoric and bloated figures such reports cannot mitigate the hunger disease and the loss of dignity that the crisis has afflicted the rural poor
68854 behind these figures the truth glares us in the face most carp lands have already been foreclosed by land bank because farmers are hardly able to pay for the high amortization rates farm lands are without irrigation farmers have no access to subsidy for farm implements and technology or these have already been grabbed by multinational corporations
68855 we have no one else to blame for the shortage of rice it is not at all topography it is only because we have a president who promotes land conversion in order for multinational companies to get their super profits while our farmers lose their lands and our nation suffers from the worst state of food insecurity in history
68856 we can all know what it feels like to live on that wage
68857 we have no money thus we have to cut costs
68858 yea because all of the govt workers make more than 30k
68859 sorry kemp but taxes are the price you pay to live in a civilized society
68860 if you dont like it go buy and island somewhere and declare independence
68861 taxes have been the way things are since the beginning of humanity
68862 a tax free libertarian utopia will never exist and if it did it would completely destroy itself

68879 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
68880 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
68881 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
68882 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
68883 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
68884 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
68885 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes
68886 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
68887 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
68888 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
68889 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
68890 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
68891 believe me if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would
68892 i tried to get to lay down at 4 oclock this morning but was up 10 minutes later because every time i closed my eyes id see this man in the window with some guys head i had just smoked a cigarette with
68893 i regret that it now appears bocog has announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time
68894 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
68895 we are going to do our best to facilitate the foreign media to do their reporting work through the internet
68896 i would remind you that falun gong is an evil fake religion which has been banned by the chinese government
68897 we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more skeptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
68898 in this short a time frame even if you took all the personal cars off the highway you might see another 10 percent improvement but it would be small

68903 bates who was appointed to the bench by bush issued a 93 page opinion that strongly rejected the administrations legal arguments he noted that the executive branch could not point to a single case in which courts held that white house aides were immune from congressional subpoenas
68904 in his ruling u s district judge john bates said theres no legal basis for bushs argument that his former legal counsel miers must appear before congress
68905 a president and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately these are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for presidential communications the privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the constitution

68950 im a huge comic book fan and ive wanted to do some comic book work for a while now and what better way to get my start than with a wrestling comic book so when mike headlocked writer creator mike kingston asked me if i would be interested in doing a cover i jumped at the chance
68951 ive always been a huge lawler fan i used to trade for tapes of memphis wrestling back before you could find everything on the internet getting to work with him and actually getting to watch him physically paint the cover has easily been my career highlight thus far
68952 its a story about all the crazy stuff that goes into what you see on television when a guy shows up on a wwe show he most likely already has four to seven years in the wrestling business but you rarely hear anything about that headlocked is the chronicle of that journey for mike hartmann
68953 he approaches wrestling the same way he did acting he bulks up just like an actor preparing for an action movie and he moves to philadelphia which is essentially hollywood for aspiring wrestlers because of his background were able to put a little more focus on the craft of professional wrestling and examine its place as a true performance art
68954 there are a lot of coming of age themes in headlocked the story is just as much about hartmann becoming a man as it is about him becoming a wrestler hes a nineteen year old college kid who has given up his relatively safe existence to chase this crazy dream and at the same time hes almost totally reinventing who he is from the ground up and hes doing this while navigating through the darker underbelly of the wrestling business as a total outsider
68955 hartmann has just moved to philadelphia having secured a tryout with the legendary leo
68956 some day and that day may never come i will call upon you to do a service for me
68957 just when i think im out they pull me back in

69000 we told you that someone would steal your horse we warned you that you would be robbed you are so poor how could you ever protect such a valuable animal it would have been better to have sold him you could have gotten whatever price you wanted no amount would have been too high now the horse is gone and youve been cursed with misfortune
69001 dont speak too quickly say only that the horse is not in the stable that is all we know the rest is judgment if ive been cursed or not how can you know how can you judge
69002 dont make us out to be fools we may not be philosophers but great philosophy is not needed the simple fact that your horse is gone is a curse
69003 all i know is that the stable is empty and the horse is gone the rest i dont know whether it be a curse or a blessing i cant say all we can see is a fragment who can say what will come next
69004 old man you were right and we were wrong what we thought was a curse was a blessing please forgive us
69005 once again you go too far say only that the horse is back state only that a dozen horses returned with him but dont judge how do you know if this is a blessing or not you see only a fragment unless you know the whole story how can you judge you read only one page of a book can you judge the whole book you read only one word of one phrase can you understand the entire phrase
69006 life is so vast yet you judge all of life with one page or one word all you have is one fragment dont say that this is a blessing no one knows i am content with what i know i am not perturbed by what i dont
69007 you proved you were right the dozen horses were not a blessing they were a curse your only son has broken both his legs and now in your old age you have no one to help you now you are poorer than ever
69008 you people are obsessed with judging dont go so far say only that my son broke his legs who knows if it is a blessing or a curse no one knows we only have a fragment life comes in fragments
69009 god knows you were right this proves it your sons accident was a blessing his legs may be broken but at least he is with you our sons are gone forever
69010 it is impossible to talk with you you always draw conclusions no one knows say only this your sons had to go to war and mine did not no one knows if it is a blessing or a curse no one is wise enough to know only god knows

69031 espero que no haya m s porque lo que menos queremos es tener que aplicar este extremo de sanciones sino que nuestros directivos los pocos que todav a tienen dudas entiendan que es un tema serio en el cual no vamos a tener tolerancia
69032 es una prueba m s que las escuelas pueden abrirse a la comunidad ampliar los horarios de atenci n y promover la participaci n de los padres de familia para impulsar el desarrollo integral de los ni os y j venes de educaci n b sica
69033 estamos convencidos de que las autoridades maestros padres de familia y alumnos participantes en este plan vacacional han realizado el mejor de sus esfuerzos para que esta primera experiencia tendiente a reforzar los lazos entre escuelas y comunidad nos haya dejando una gran experiencia

69035 galicia es uno de los principales n cleos de neurociencia de espa a junto con madrid barcelona alicante y sevilla hay adem s varios neurocient ficos gallegos de relevancia internacional
69036 por otro lado a ade tambi n investigo los mecanismos que regulan el cambio de actividad neuronal que ocurre al pasar del sue o a la vigilia esto es algo importante si se tiene en cuenta que se est comparando un estado consciente con otro inconsciente lo cual puede dar pistas muy interesantes sobre el funcionamiento del enc falo
69037 trabajamos en una l nea de investigaci n que se conoce como neurociencia computacional cuyo objetivo es la construcci n de modelos computacionales para poder explicar y predecir el funcionamiento del cerebro en concreto nos centramos en desarrollar modelos y teor as acerca del procesamiento de la informaci n tanto en el sistema somatosensorial como en el sistema visual
69038 esta relaci n se ala cudeiro es fundamental para entender c mo funciona el cerebro dado que la actividad cerebral depende en cada momento del aporte del flujo sangu neo en cada rea activada para entender su importancia no hay m s que pensar en los trastornos que aparecen cuando una zona del cerebro queda privada de ox geno como en el caso de un ictus o en que las modernas t cnicas de estudio de la funci n cerebral la pet o la resonancia magn tica funcional se basan en dicha relaci n
69039 el grupo neurocom es pionero en espa a en la utilizaci n de estimulaci n sensorial r tmica ya sea auditiva visual cut nea o propioceptiva para mejorar el movimiento en los enfermos de p rkinson sobre todo la marcha

69041 nuestras l neas de investigaci n se centran en el desarrollo y organizaci n del cerebro de los vertebrados lo cual nos permite comprender el origen y caracter sticas de los vertebrados m s primitivos como la lamprea y su posterior evoluci n adem s tambi n estamos interesados en comprender la organizaci n de los circuitos motores la lamprea posee una serie de caracter sticas que hacen que sea un material especialmente interesante para abordar este tipo de cuestiones estamos comenzando a identificar genes espec ficos de la lamprea implicados en el desarrollo de su cerebro y a determinar sus lugares de expresi n
69042 en uno de los ltimos trabajos en los que particip nuestro grupo apunta pombal inyectamos una sustancia que provoca la muerte de las c lulas dopamin rgicas tal y como hab a sido ya comprobado en otras especies reproduciendo as la alteraci n celular implicada en la enfermedad de p rkinson por lo tanto ahora tenemos la posibilidad de provocar la p rdida de esas c lulas en las lampreas y analizar c mo afectan a su movimiento
69043 nos interesa saber c mo funcionan la neuronas individualmente excitabilidad celular y para ello estudiamos las corrientes i nicas que permiten a una determinada neurona ser y comportarse de forma diferente a cualquier otra tambi n nos interesa conocer c mo esa personalidad propia de cada neurona modifica el comportamiento del sistema ya que las neuronas en el sistema nervioso siempre est n en contacto con muchas otras proporcionando y recibiendo informaci n
69044 ha estado a la altura no s lo de la que se lleva a cabo en nuestro pa s sino que es reconocida internacionalmente desafortunadamente los grupos de investigaci n son pocos y la financiaci n escasa sin embargo el nivel de calidad de nuestra investigaci n no tiene mucho que envidiar al que se realiza en otros pa ses

69046 por supuesto responde sin dudar me indigna que se le dedique tanto espacio y tiempo a frivolidades relacionadas con por ejemplo el mundo del deporte dejando al margen las disciplinas que son esenciales para la formaci n de personas con un m nimo esp ritu cr tico vivimos en un mundo de cr dulos aborregados
69047 una ni a de unos 8 a os se plant en medio y nos puso en un aprieto con su pregunta qu es una neurona

69053 sir we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive after three days i will rise again therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away and tell the people he has been raised from the dead and the last deception would be worse than the first

69082 from a wrestling standpoint this show blows away anything from the big groups in several months
69083 the roh tag team bout between champs age of the fall and challengers bryan danielson amp austin aries is worth the 10 price tag alone the fight without honor between strong and stevens is a fitting end to their feud with the blow off grudge match we rarely see in the realm of sports entertainment from top to bottom if you want athletics in your wrestling you want roh who start their second year of ppvs the same as their first with a wrestling ppv focused on great wrestling
69084 i highly recommend this ppv when it premiers this friday on ppv you wont get more value for your dollar than you do with roh ppvs stevens and black are really stepping up and becoming must see performers in the company their performances on this show are the highlights of the ppv the production on this show was fantastic by roh standards as well

69091 a simple idea that became the foundation of our modern banking system
69092 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
69093 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
69094 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
69095 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
69096 i went back to the room after meetings heard it saw it just kind of chuckled because i have no idea where it came from i have no idea where those stories come from
69097 you dont know where it comes from it seems like its something different everyday
69098 were going to miss him i was surprised he didnt say anything to anybody i wish him nothing but the best i hope he lands somewhere else and has nothing but success
69099 hes going to have an mri just to check everything out make sure that theres something we havent missed
69100 according to trainer steve antonopulos its not the knee its beneath the knee the bursa sac thats causing him a little irritation right now he doesnt think its anything serious
69101 well check it out with an mri and hopefully everything is fine and hes just a little bit sore
69102 hes in the process of establishing himself and one thing he does is that hes an explosive pass rusher
69103 he loves to rush the passer and what we have to do as the season goes on is see where he is as far as where he fits im sure glad we got him and hes done a good job for us to this point
69104 coming out to denver to play running back is a huge opportunity
69105 they have a good thing going out there with this offense i just have to stay positive and focused have fun with it and good things will come
69106 the broncos are known as easy to push around on offensive line and defensive line
69107 lets just go ahead and say it this team aint any good
69108 ill talk to a team and i think have a pretty good gauge of a situation that will be right ill consider my family ill consider everything and if one presents itself that feels good and feels like something where id put forth the commitment then well see
69109 i tried to take an approach coming into camp this year where i was just going to enjoy every opportunity to get on the field and every second
69110 it was different in that for the last 14 15 years being a starter in this league the expectations for the organization were that i play at a pro bowl level and help carry a team
69111 i think i handled it well i prepared myself at an incredible fitness level and was ready to play but ultimately it wasnt the right situation
69112 john shared with me that hed lost some concentration in base packages and made some mistakes hed never make just because he was thinking about playing and not playing all the time
69113 i still have a great passion for the game of football and very much love it in my heart
69114 i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not just going to play for any team in any situation
69115 you cant replace the type of leadership and experience and things of that nature
69116 we knew somewhere down the road john was going to have to make a decision and see where he fit into the defense this year and there would be a crossroads somewhere down the line depending on how things worked out during the preseason games
69117 i knew john would never be happy not playing every down
69118 thats what makes john john but some players accept the role if they arent starters they can kind of work with the young guys and build up their game
69119 in my opinion mr chance does meet the criteria for mental retardation
69120 i really thought the thumps on the wall was a continuation of them just having fun
69121 thank you madam mr president i simply cannot say enough about these great student athletes gathered here today they did exactly what every coach in this great country hopes his team will do they took em one at a time not a single person looked ahead to new hampshire they all gave 110 percent they overcame great adversity not to mention some of the most egg sucking officials you could imagine we were the only team in the world to beat the nittany lions the grizzly bears the fightin tigers the gulpin gators and the zany zebras during the course of a single schedule please accept and wear whenever possible especially if youre in front of a tv camera this beautiful jersey no 1 as a small token of our appreciation for your special interest in our great program and may god bless us all and the screamin eagles program which we like to think of as americas first team of football
69122 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
69123 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
69124 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
69125 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
69126 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
69127 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
69128 overall its fair to say that were pretty inefficient in this state when it comes to water use
69129 time and energy was wasted on shifting or avoiding blame
69130 thats a much more active role than weve had in the past
69131 some of these people have been here since they were babies
69132 heres a woman who has lived here all her life who has done nothing wrong
69133 her child is an american citizen were going to deport her
69134 people say well that is the law but the law in germany put jews in the ovens
69135 the mouse doctors and cell biologists are of course quite enthusiastic about these things but the human doctors are a little more reticent
69136 it was found to be a quite safe drug at least at the doses we were using
69137 being out here just running and being in the huddle its just a great feeling to be out here in football instead of in rehab by myself
69138 jamelle is ahead because hes played and been around and went through the spring
69139 hes the no 1 guy and well go from there but nobody has the jersey plastered on their back anybody can win the job but hes on the top of the heap right now and well see how it goes
69140 it feels great to be out there with the team just be back into the routine
69141 it just feels great to be back out there with the guys again
69142 its not as helpful as it first seems given the overall cost of books and how early you need to order
69143 many students dont have a final book list yet for their classes or they arent back and it doesnt do anything for the round of books needed for second semester
69144 i found it a heck of a lot cheaper through amazon
69145 i usually got new books for less than the price of used books here
69146 we always said before when it was 100 that it wasnt high enough
69147 the legislatures action is welcome but it is certainly a short term step
69148 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
69149 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
69150 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
69151 give em all a little nuclear waste and let em take it on down there to mexico tell em itll heat tortillas
69152 he supports abortion oh this is incredible no no no ken salazar oh for me this is no good

69157 die hochbegabten f rderung steckt in deutschland noch in den kinderschuhen
69158 das ist ein gro es potenzial f r die gesellschaft das besser genutzt werden k nnte
69159 sie haben oft das problem dass sie sich f r viele dinge interessieren

69163 its too boring to keep watching something that has no movement
69164 up up down down left right left right b a start
69165 its too boring to keep watching something that has no movement
69166 up up down down left right left right b a start
69167 its too boring to keep watching something that has no movement
69168 up up down down left right left right b a start
69169 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
69170 i think hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
69171 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
69172 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
69173 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
69174 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
69175 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
69176 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics

69180 het is juist voor kleine uitgevers bedoeld zodat alle stappen gecombineerd worden journalisten blijven gewoon hun werk doen en kunnen hierbij op eenvoudige manier de vertaalslag maken van hun traditionele werk naar de toepassing in nieuwe media
69181 het verdienmodel dat succesvol is wisselt voortdurend voor kranten is dat het advertentiemodel het verdienmodel dat het meeste oplevert heeft alles te maken met onderscheidend zijn in het plaatsen van advertenties il giornale werkt bijvoorbeeld niet zelf met videonieuws maar heeft een adverteerder aangetrokken die een pop up plaatst tegen betaling met videonieuws dat elk uur ververst uitgevers moeten manieren ontwikkelen waarin zij ruimte bieden voor adverteerders op de meest opdringende manier die nog getolereerd wordt
69182 it is a landmark victory for traditional owners and we have waited for over 30 years for our sea rights to be legally recognized
69183 i think we now have got to negotiate on a lot of things that we disagree on
69184 morally other aboriginal people would now be able to argue that if these sorts of rights are being provided to aboriginal people in the northern territory they should be extended elsewhere
69185 i think the key way through this is common sense
69186 for the past two years ibm researchers have been developing technology to help people recall events names of new acquaintances and details of a conversation in their context with the use of cell phone and computer on tuesday ibm research labs plans to publicize an early version of its personal assistant software called pensieve after the fictional memory bank described in harry potter books ibm posted a video on youtube not available publicly yet the software could feasibly be used with any mobile smart phone the technology relies on people keeping track of whats important to them by using the phone to snap photos create text documents or record audio when the phone is synced to a computer via a pensieve enabled dock the software takes over it collates files by their tagged gps location and time among other rules and creates associations between them

69198 its a way to get votes now because everyone is mad at the whole treasurer debacle
69199 if it is a way to trim government we need to consider it
69200 why is being answerable to city council three times removed more control than being directly answerable to voters
69201 its about the people deciding how government ought to be run
69202 i certainly believe that it would end up costing the city more money in the long run because of our loss of state funds that pay for most of the operation of these offices if we take it over
69203 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned

69212 to neil how stupid to suggest users check any result with value
69213 i did countif c1 c65535 65535 to see how many calculated correctly
69214 excel only is displaying the result incorrectly if you take the 100000 cell and use it in a another calculation it is correctly used as 65535
69215 what happens with all of these vendors on the next generation the timing of all this is going to be interesting we know a little bit more now than we did a year ago but not a huge amount
69216 i know internally how many steps away the 3d hardware vendors are from where they think theyll be pitching consoles
69217 i think its going to be far too tempting to one up your competitor because they dont think youre doing this but you really are to get it out earlier and try and get some first mover advantage so i dont think its going to be too long
69218 i hope its long enough that were able to have a new project come out at a nice sweet spot for this generation and not when everybody knows whats coming next christmas
69219 there are people that honestly believe the pc will come back and make consoles obsolete i think that probably is a naive view
69220 i think there are inherent challenges for the pc platform that consoles dont have that i would be surprised to see that desktop pc box making sony and 360 and wiis and everything obsolete i dont think thats going to happen
69221 gamesindustry biz has become an essential part of my morning routine its global viewpoint is a perfect bellwether for industry news trends and events theres nothing quite like a coffee and an exclusive scoop
69222 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico

69228 piper is our largest brightest light in clean tech investment banking this can only be good for minnesota and our energy opportunities
69229 i believe the midwest has the ability to be the epicenter of the bioenergy and clean technology industry
69230 piper is a national and international firm in the alternative energy business we will encourage and stimulate early stage developments and well raise capital for later stage investments and initial public offerings
69231 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
69232 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
69233 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
69234 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
69235 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
69236 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
69237 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
69238 any massively multiplayer online game that launches today isnt just competing with the amount and breadth of content that we launched with back in 2004
69239 age of conan released with some initial success a couple of months ago and we did see some of our players leave to try the game however weve seen about 40 percent of those players return to world of warcraft
69240 any massively multiplayer online game that launches today isnt just competing with the amount and breadth of content that we launched with back in 2004
69241 another competitive advantage is our ability to amortize our development costs across more than 10 million subscribers spread out over three continents
69242 im not just a ditzy blond they know they have to be a little more fearful
69243 never took the blame for steven being on the block and evicted
69244 today there is a realisation amongst saarc countries that it is only by cooperating within saarc that we will be able to strengthen ourselves individually and as a region and address the many common challenges that face us
69245 the transaction was one that calls for explanation in that the respondent took no alternatively no reasonable steps to determine whether the consideration payable by him under the agreement was fair and proper
69246 it is on the facts which i have found explicable by the ordinary motives of the people concerned in the relationships in which they found themselves
69247 looked at as a whole this was not a normal commercial transaction it had important family elements in it thus the likelihood that nothing in real terms would change as far as use of the property was concerned the fact that completion anyway was going to be delayed for years the fact that a substantial part of the consideration was none the less being paid at once and finally and on the evidence which i accept very much as the trigger and reason for what was done that the transaction was going to get the appellant and her husband out of the hole into which they had dug themselves with the lenders and give them cash in hand
69248 first that a mortgagee although he may exercise his power of sale at any time and forths own choice owes the mortgagor a duty to take reasonable care to obtain a proper price for the mortgaged property at that time secondly that the duty is not tortuous in nature but one recognised by equity as arising out of the particular relationship between mortgagee and mortgagee
69249 its been unbelievable weve gathered about 1 566 books for kids
69250 the community individuals and organizations have responded as only prince george can
69251 i received a grant of 750 from children first thats providing 128 abc canada books and more than 100 books from the office of shirley bond mla for prince george mount robson
69252 while mps as a group will never top public approval polls i am concerned as a democrat and a strong believer in the importance of parliament as an institution that its continued humiliation by such behaviour is bad for our democracy and that things have to change
69253 i urge all those involved to stop the name calling the muck raking and the silly games and address the issues so that the public can make its judgement
69254 fuck this im a writer i dont belong here im an artist
69255 gould and dawkins do not claim that evolution as a religion or that it should be treated as one and neither do i that would be ridiculous since if i were equating the two that would mean i think people ought to grow out of their absurd faith in evolution
69256 the probability that a particular adverse event occurs during a stated period of time or results from a particular challenge
69257 an organized systematic decision making process that efficiently identifies risks assesses or analyzes risks and effectively reduces or eliminates risks to achieving the program goals

69259 scholar ceased to take up different sciences simultaneously but he does no t even cover a single science completely anymore
69260 individuals whom are not confronted by sufficient moral constraint and does not have a clear concept of what is and what is not proper and acceptable behavior
69261 really we dont know what is going to happen with that but i would think that they would scatter his ashes over the sierra maestra mountains
69262 there was enough wind to power t boone pickens turbines for a year
69263 brutally beat and raped this 30 year old wife and mother of two
69264 if this individual was thought to be a threat to the general public a press release would have been done up at the time
69265 we would have appreciated that the husband had got hold of us first and maybe asked some questions i cant speak to the investigation but obviously we are working on it
69266 she got the impression this guy was involved in the highway of tears killing because of stuff he did
69267 he started fumbling under the seat looking for a weapon or something and he was getting more and more agitated he kicked her in the face and he told her this is your lucky day and he kicked her again and drove off
69268 in the last five days theres been three attempts other than what happened to my wife on girls downtown
69269 this guy has been active almost every month for four years on saturday there was another attempt and the girl gave police the identical description as what my wife gave
69270 my grandchildren refused to use the outhouse and the adults are refusing to use it because the waste is piled so high
69271 the whole campsite the trails right down to the water is littered with piles of human feces and used toilet paper there are used needles lying around i picked up seven of them myself both the needles and the decomposed waste are very dangerous for kids running around with bare feet
69272 i want the province to put up some money to clean up and maintain this site
69273 summit lake is a priority and the contractor waited too long
69274 we have a contract for maintenance of the site so the contractor should ensure the area is kept clean
69275 it make us look like we have no respect for our own province
69276 summit lake is a trouble site with gangs youth parties and vandalism such as breaking doors and picnic tables
69277 so we need the public to be our eyes and ears and to inform us or the rcmp about whats going on at the sites
69278 the best thing that could happen for the ministry and taxpayers is self policing by volunteer groups and camp users to help maintain the sites
69279 the campsite at summit lake is the worst ive ever been to i will not use another forestry camp site in b c
69280 the corporation estimated that particularly for bingo we could be facing declines of up to 25 per cent that was our projection
69281 the situation in prince george is unique where we have one business partner providing the full service casino and the community gaming centre
69282 it is a landmark victory for traditional owners and we have waited for over 30 years for our sea rights to be legally recognized
69283 i think we now have got to negotiate on a lot of things that we disagree on
69284 morally other aboriginal people would now be able to argue that if these sorts of rights are being provided to aboriginal people in the northern territory they should be extended elsewhere
69285 i think the key way through this is common sense
69286 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
69287 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
69288 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
69289 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
69290 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things
69291 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
69292 i hope that barack could pull the troops from iraq
69293 im feelin like a black republican naw i cant call it more like a black democrat runnin em out of office young barack obama im all for it
69294 theres a whole lotta room in the front of the range like barack obama said yeah its time for a change
69295 why is bush acting like he trying to get osama why dont we impeach him and elect obama
69296 its time for a change and that change is obama dear future president i hope you heard this letter and do some things to make sure the next one im writing is better
69297 america surprised us and let a black man guide us
69298 you ever think youd see a white rapper endorse a black president
69299 it means that some 98 000 pages of evidence which the state confiscated in raids on mr zumas homes and also those of his legal adviser at the time two of his legal advisers can be used as evidence against him in the corruption trial which is scheduled to get underway next week
69300 it flows out of the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser schabir sheik and it revolves around money that was said to have been solicited by zuma in order that he would intervene on behalf of a company bidding for parts of south africas arms deal
69301 on these particular matters yes but he will next week seek to have the entire case thrown out of court when his trial is due to begin in kwazulu natal province in pietermartizburg there are also other applications pending one in mauritius another in the united kingdom where he is seeking to have the release of documents to the national prosecuting authority blocked
69302 with all the evidence that is now before them i dont see any reason why the authorities should continue with these investigations of alleged sodomy
69303 in any other system where there is justice and fairness the powers would have by now shut down the investigations and cleared my name
69304 we clearly are looking at an afghanistan where results are mixed the challenges are certainly significant and wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
69305 bates who was appointed to the bench by bush issued a 93 page opinion that strongly rejected the administrations legal arguments he noted that the executive branch could not point to a single case in which courts held that white house aides were immune from congressional subpoenas
69306 in his ruling u s district judge john bates said theres no legal basis for bushs argument that his former legal counsel miers must appear before congress
69307 a president and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately these are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for presidential communications the privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the constitution
69308 they talk about holding full fair and transparent proceedings yet a page from the 9 11 commission report can be classified as well as the entire testimony of two important witnesses
69309 the reason closed sessions are so troubling at guantanamo is because the government has so frequently claimed things have had to be classified to cover up abuse and torture
69310 in addition trials of this magnitude should have a public record if a significant amount of evidence and witness testimony is classified it will be very hard to trust any verdict
69311 each and every mujahid belongs to this very soil of india
69312 the human resources management of tesco is effective in motivating their employees and maintaining a good work environment
69313 a healthy organisation is one in which an obvious effort is made to get people with different backgrounds skills and abilities to work together toward the goal or purpose of the organisation while people have not accomplished this at a societal level it is achievable at an organisational level

69333 joe needed to live his life im on the road a lot it wasnt fair to either of us
69334 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
69335 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
69336 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
69337 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
69338 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the un soldiers on the ground
69339 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
69340 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
69341 we hope that iran will choose cooperation instead of increasing isolation and will give us in the following days a response that the international community is waiting for
69342 hard to believe the passion burned out what with all those bike races and such

69344 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are
69345 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
69346 it is reprehensible for musgrave to claim that she supports energy efficiency and conservation while opposing real reform in fuel efficiency and real savings for american families her election year conversion on the issue of fuel economy standards is a cynical attempt to blur her dismal record on these issues
69347 i am very disappointed to learn that congresswoman musgrave sided with oil and gas companies to oppose good legislation that would have increased automobile fuel efficiency standards and saved us hundreds of dollars per year in gas
69348 she can pump all the gas she wants and show her so called concern about fuel costs in an election year but nothing can erase the fact that shes been part of the problem and not part of the solution when it comes to rising fuel costs for colorado families
69349 after so many years in washington swimming in the pocket of oil and gas companies marilyn musgrave has lost touch with her own constituents
69350 it is reprehensible for musgrave to claim that she supports energy efficiency and conservation while opposing real reform in fuel efficiency and real savings for american families her election year conversion on the issue of fuel economy standards is a cynical attempt to blur her dismal record on these issues
69351 we deserve better than a politician like rep musgrave whose priorities are not in line with the needs of ordinary working families

69380 the response has been excellent the phone hasnt stopped ringing there are 1 400 e mails in my in basket as of noon thursday
69381 that drove our servers to crash and we have pretty hefty servers there were 70 000 hits
69382 lets just say yes we demonstrated it to an undersecretary of defense but im not at liberty to say any more
69383 we talked to the wall street journal but they dont quite believe it we tried cnn and they werent believing it we didnt get far through that door
69384 because they make so much money off of lost phones
69385 keeping the hathaway open shows that we are not giving up this years certification runs out in january so i know we can keep it open until then
69386 without state certification people will not be able to borrow from other libraries they will be limited to what is within these four walls
69387 we have made personnel reductions for our office all we were asking for was 5 000 and that was directly attributable to salaries the board is concerned about the added workload causing trouble as we come up on our recertification deadline
69388 every year we improve on the tradition when we first stared we started like everybody else but every year we kick it up a notch
69389 what the feast does for us here is to bring in hundreds of thousands of people
69390 today its unquestionable that madeiran immigrants who wished to build a life in the united states became part of the greatness of this country
69391 quick feet quick feet we want to be athletes today
69392 i see them staring at me this week eager to learn eager to play
69393 weve got a lot of good ball players and some of them are coming from tough areas some didnt even come in with the right shoes but they have a love and passion for the game and this allows them to focus on something and get good at it
69394 throughout the week community police officers juvenile detectives and staff from the district attorneys office spent some time interacting with the kids its the first step in determining whether there will be interest in a full fledged police athletic league
69395 if you dont believe in yourself no one will believe in you once you have confidence you can achieve anything if you dont youre probably not going to get the job done
69396 you have to put your heart soul blood sweat and tears in to make it perfect
69397 in five years now the sky has not fallen the earth has not opened to swallow us all up and more to the point thousands and thousands of good people contributing members of our society are able to make free decisions about their personal future and we ought to seek to affirm that every chance we can
69398 its extremely important if something happened to one of us shed always be taken care of
69399 now new yorkers can drive across the border to a neighboring state and get a marriage license that will be recognized as fully legal and valid here at home
69400 this is a clarion call for the rest of the nation on the dangers of this radical social experiment and also the essential need for a federal marriage amendment to clearly define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
69401 same sex marriage is a social experiment and it certainly will have an impact on the culture particularly the children where we already see that in massachusetts children are being educated on the efficacy of same sex marriage and the irrelevance of fatherhood and motherhood
69402 what we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that its weeded and i think weve weeded out a discriminatory law
69403 we are trying to show state support of what they are trying to do at the congressional level
69404 we will continue to support the hardworking folks who work so tirelessly within the industry
69405 they put their lives on the line to take care of us its an honor to be able to do something for them
69406 this program has put us where we need to be
69407 they didnt even try to assist us in any way
69408 the unemployment part takes away a little of the risk
69409 the joy you get when you buy your first home thats a wonderful feeling
69410 and i think thats only magnified by the fact that this is a true homecoming for sgt brett
69411 in the first case a 39 year old female taking 50mg a day of vitamin b6 for three months developed a feeling of burning pain and
69412 she was also taking a multivitamin product containing vitamin b6 and therefore her total daily dose most likely exceeded the upper level of intake of 50mg a day recommended by national guidelines
69413 all patients should be advised of the risks associated with excessive doses of vitamins the bulletin stated
69414 if the victim is allowed to be interviewed or there are any other witnesses that have not come forward and are willing to offer information the complaint would be reviewed based on the new information
69415 i dont know how true that is and what the mothers reasons are
69416 the program is a head scratcher to think people are going to come forward and walk away from their life here it shows how desperate and delusional this administration has gotten in dealing with illegal immigration
69417 im going to go out on a limb here and say there wont be lines around the block for this program
69418 when you order grounding of planes and people are making significant driving changes in the u s because the price of food and gasoline has doubled thats very bearish for oil prices moving forward
69419 people looked at yesterdays frenzied rally and realized the fundamentals werent there to support it
69420 were seeing a lower volume trade because this bull market seems to be over at least for the time being
69421 even when those factories reopen i think weve crossed a threshold where the speculative money isnt coming back into the oil market for the rest of 2008
69422 last year we had over 325 riders and we expect more this year
69423 this years event will establish a southeastern massachusetts motorcyclists survivors fund
69424 i think im gonna divorce my wife she aint spoke to me in over two months
69425 better think it over women like that are hard to find
69426 health care is the single most important issue facing our economy and our citizens
69427 this legislation will install an impressive set of reforms to change the way our health care system operates
69428 im very pleased that we do not have to start from scratch next year
69429 i think this is a really positive step in the right direction as we continue to work hard to address the issue of dropouts and dropout prevention in the state of massachusetts
69430 our witnesses have led us to believe that the children and their mother were taken against their will
69431 with all due respect to you personally i will defend myself before this institution as i would defend myself before any natural catastrophe
69432 i have not found one bone of my children yet and there he is alive
69433 today i feel there is a bit of justice in this otherwise really pitiful world
69434 its the beast i did not believe it until now
69435 happy because the world seems to be not as bad as i thought so far if it forced him to the courtroom sad because 100 000 people he killed are not watching this
69436 to negotiate an agreement with milosevic and two of karadzics henchmen that karadzic would quit as president of the serbian portion of bosnia and as head of his political party immediately and disappear from public life
69437 reluctantly signed that agreement without ever coming to the negotiations
69438 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
69439 his behavior was correct at the same time he wants to sabotage the proceedings
69440 if the allegations against perez are true and we have every reason to believe they are he could only be accurately characterized as a cowardly weasel only fit for jail because there is nowhere else we can put him
69441 like the opportunistic parasitical predator that he is he seized the opportunity to take advantage of her trust and steal her innocence
69442 the victims courage and tenacity prevented her from being further victimized and should serve as a role model for anybody else who find themselves in similar circumstances
69443 it moves the ball forward for consumers but its not a panacea
69444 it doesnt go as far as we would have liked to go
69445 since it sounds like a softer version than i would have liked im hopeful that perhaps they will take a real good look on whether they will pass this at all
69446 the cape delegation has made a real effort to put things forward that they felt would help the citizens i am concerned about how much benefit citizens will have
69447 has language which is either going to do nothing or is actually going to hurt the citizens of the cape
69448 while we want to have a contract that is fair to rhode island taxpayers and some of the lowest paid state employees council 94 will not be bullied coerced or intimidated
69449 we have no intention no intention of offering more than what was already negotiated and agreed to that was our best and final offer
69450 anything we have to do to clean these fields we are going to do
69451 we are going to continue to test and we are going to get it cleaned up we will come up with a remediation plan and get it done
69452 we have been assured the arsenic level there is not an immediate health risk
69453 we need to wait until the data has been verified until we understand the scope of the problem and what we must do to fix it this situation in the area of keith middle school requires the city remain vigilant and do everything possible to protect public health and safety which i believe the lang administration is doing and which i fully support
69454 we are moving on this quickly resampling today within a couple of weeks we should have this figured out and understood
69455 this piques everybodys interest it is prudent not to use the fields in the meantime just to be safe
69456 some said the rebates would not have an impact well they were wrong
69457 the stimulus checks are having an impact in spite of the energy prices
69458 provides one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economic picture
69459 it was very useful especially when you look at areas like getting formula
69460 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
69461 it is an unwise and unfortunate move to cause economic strife to public servants and their families who are working hard and playing by the rules
69462 i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation
69463 im here to make sure that our state functions and whatever it takes i will do it
69464 we are ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need to do their job
69465 toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates have no business in our childrens toys
69466 safety testing and certification for such hazards as powerful magnets before products are sold a ban on lead and phthalates and more will helpfully put an end to the recalls of childrens products and the horror stories that lead to those recalls
69467 if you know the problem is there you can start addressing the problem
69468 it significantly impairs your ability to stay independent which is what people want
69469 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
69470 poor balance isnt something you have to accept you can help yourself you can improve balance
69471 if they have a sensor that can detect differences in balance it is fairly easy to train the elderly using physical therapy to improve their balance
69472 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
69473 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
69474 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
69475 as we are facing difficulty with the direction of the economy including rising raw material prices although there are relatively few japan led factors we need to address this issue
69476 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
69477 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
69478 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
69479 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
69480 in that sense hes going to have to move something he hasnt characteristically done in his entire career
69481 theres something powerful about musicians giving instruments they own to an auction to aid musicians who are going through a particularly difficult time
69482 a lot of musicians were forced to leave the city leaving behind their instruments and record collections everything they needed to do what they do
69483 the kind of organic community music academy that was so supportive of handing down the traditions of this music from generation to generation was really vulnerable
69484 we try to support as many charity organisations as we can but we specifically target campaigns that relate to young children
69485 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
69486 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
69487 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
69488 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
69489 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
69490 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
69491 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met
69492 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
69493 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
69494 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
69495 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
69496 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
69497 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
69498 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
69499 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
69500 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
69501 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
69502 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
69503 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
69504 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
69505 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
69506 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
69507 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue
69508 il faut poursuivre tes r ves accomplir ce en quoi tu crois
69509 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
69510 it is a balance between the goal of openness and the need to address some national security concerns
69511 undoubtedly an unpleasant highly regimented experience with instant rewards or loss of privileges for infractions
69512 they say its fair and open but secrecy affects every part of these proceedings
69513 i didnt think the energy was where it was last night and the effort areas were down from our game against china
69514 something we havent had in this group is an inside target like bogut and with angolas quickness to have a guy like that was a huge advantage and he was the difference in the two teams
69515 he was dominant and was our answer to a lot of the difficulties we had on the court thats a real positive going into the games
69516 theyre one of the favourites to come out of our group at the games first and every big campaign over the last couple of years the olympics and the world championships theyve come out in the top four so theyre going to be a very tough match up for us
69517 we cant play a european style of basketball against them because theyre a very good half court team
69518 were going to play the australian style and get up in them like we did in these last two games pressuring guys defensively and if we go to our strengths offensively well be fine

69523 something which has never occurred since time immemorial a young woman did not fart in her husbands lap
69524 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing
69525 theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
69526 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
69527 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
69528 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favourite golf courses that we have on tour
69529 the guy thats won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here
69530 i felt like i grinded really well ive just got to shoot low tomorrow
69531 whether it was the right decision or wrong decision it is a decision i made
69532 im not going to think about what other people think about me all im going to think about is how im going to shoot a better score tomorrow and how im going to shoot a low number and i think a low number will take care of everything
69533 phillips died of a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy said forsyth county medical examiner dr patrick lantz the condition causes cells in the heart to grow and form a mass that can obstruct blood flow and disrupt normal heart rhythms lantz said according to his medical history phillips hadnt been diagnosed with the condition lantz said
69534 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
69535 i hate to say it i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 today
69536 i mean his was the open championship mine was the senior open championship but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common
69537 so it was a nice walk on tuesday with these guys and i got up and struck the ball nicely i said ok new week lets just go at it again
69538 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
69539 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
69540 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
69541 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 per cent or 30 per cent or 18 per cent
69542 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
69543 i just dont understand how his 4 year old son can be sitting directly between him amp the tv amp he doesnt see the kid playing with a lighter
69544 everyone is unhappy our home is miserable amp im completely frustrated amp angry all the time you kids are angry amp frustrated with me amp gt its getting worse someone has to do something about this amp i decided that it will be me i have decided that i will no longer be responsible for getting you to bed on time or getting you up in the mornings i will not tell you to wash your hands before dinner amp i will not tell you to brush your teeth or take a bath you must list all those things for which you have assumed responsibility whatever they are i am no longer going to do anything that will give you the opportunity to treat me with disrespect in the future if you need anything you must ask your dad i will no longer take responsibility for whatever getting your school supplies shopping for your clothes doing your laundry taking you to basketball practice etc what i hope to accomplish is for us to begin to get along with each other amp the only way i know to do that is to let your dad be the parent
69545 from now on i expect everyone to put their stuff away by bedtime since i will no longer be asking you to do it because i dont want to argue with you anything that is left out after 9 00 will be disposed
69546 if you dont clear the table after dinner i will not set a place for you at the next meal
69547 if you leave your dirty clothes on the floor in the bathroom they will be disposed
69548 well were in the car on the way to the ballgame now im home free to be disrespectful

69581 puedes tener los mejores ingredientes pero tienes que saber utilizarlos

69646 ive seen pictures of the leaves before ive actually seen marijuana plants before too and i was a little surprised to see them right there theyve been found in the park before but its been a long time i called the police to come see because i knew theyd be interested in that

69712 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could save just as much

69717 we returned viz vitae to the race course after a severe tendon injury
69718 in the case of viz vitae he would have been retired
69719 when you have these injuries the tendons infill with scar tissue which is inflexible and the tendon no longer has its mechanical power generating capacity
69720 what were trying to do is return a fully functioning tendon by regrowing the tendon cells and return it to its normal function
69721 people arent willing to spend thousands of us dollars to repair a 5 cat or dog
69722 the principle is very simple but the cost is very high
69723 early results to date in terms of returning injured horses to the racetrack have been nothing short of stunning
69724 this horse suggests to us at lindsay park that no matter how severe the tendon injury stem cells promise a complete regeneration of the damaged tissue
69725 the stem cells promise to speed those repairs but trying to keep these horses immobilised for a long time is very very difficult
69726 at this stage what we can say is the cells we were able to expand into massive doses have been proven to create bone and create cartilage
69727 the best horse of the generation tends to capture the hearts and minds of people
69728 our fear is that without competition from the non bank sector it does allow the banks far more freedom to further their interests
69729 the rise of the non bank industry led to a lot of price and terms of conditions competition and new products which was terrific for the consumer
69730 people are finding it risky to lend based on whats happening on the capital market
69731 my advice to small business is to be very careful and wary of loans to cover cash flow in a downturn in the economy
69732 at times like these in the economic cycle efficiency gains have to be instituted in a small business whether that means cutting staff finding cheaper and quicker administrative processes such as using it or simply cutting the cloth
69733 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer vertically integrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins

69748 in art nothing is more secondary than the artists intentions
69749 the word precursor is indespensible to the vocabulary of criticism
69750 the dark and tragic conviction that man is always the maker of his own doom
69751 im really glad i could just be out here to see all the support and see how many friends he has because this is exactly what he would have wanted
69752 im stunned ever since last night the phone rang at 2 30 a m and i thought it was a friend just being stupid the next thing i know my mom was freaking out saying my dad was killed i felt like it was a bad dream i feel like this is a bad dream but im just not going to wake up
69753 thats what were doing were correcting those deficiencies and were moving forward
69754 i do not believe that it has tarnished the reputation of the port authority
69755 its highly unlikely that they have 37 children that they are responsible for very highly unlikely its just a very deceitful scheme they theyve used to get this property out so they can sell it
69756 we have to look at our budget and see how much money we have and what we can replace and what we cannot replace
69757 we want to get the most out of budget for our library customer
69758 when something like this happens materials are then not available for other people to borrow it does cost money for us to replace the materials
69759 it was like tunnel vision because all i saw was a gun at my head
69760 they pointed a gun at her head and told her to lay down they drug me around the house
69761 viewers saw these individuals going into the house they recognized them and called crimestoppers
69762 these pictures were clear there was no modification that needed to be done the pictures showed the individual persons as they are
69763 these are some very dangerous individuals were very fortunate to have a viewer or viewers contact crimestoppers and give us a tip we needed
69764 ive flown with him hes flown my airplane he was very experienced a more than adequate pilot
69765 it wasnt a smooth takeoff the plane seemed to be bouncing i guess it got up just a little bit and then it went nose first into the marsh
69766 it is inherently a very strong aircraft its not a fragile aircraft by any means
69767 certainly when pilots find themselves in hazardous weather like thunderstorms controllability comes into question
69768 i would be shocked if there is any pilot error involved in this crash knowing the pilot i just cant believe that it would be pilot error
69769 because of our high performance we are once again on the road to be recognized as a district with distinction in performance for the fifth consecutive year this is a tremendous accomplishment however we are not satisfied we expect continuous improvement and know there is still work to do to meet this communitys high expectations
69770 too many students dont take the map test seriously because it doesnt matter to them
69771 it doesnt count for grades scholarships etc and therefore they dont give their best effort
69772 the missouri department of elementary and secondary education recommends the grade counts for a portion of the final grade
69773 i just hope that he really finds god while hes in prison
69774 she said so and they just took the kids word and the teachers are thrown under the road so to speak
69775 justice has taken its course i feel that the wheels of justice have prevailed im very much pleased with what the judge came to in the verdict in there were happy with it
69776 there was an abuse of power here he was in a position of power and he took advantage of that and he committed a crime against these girls
69777 i was hoping in the back of my mind that the lifeguard wouldnt be there
69778 loud booming voice would the illegal swimmer turn around and go back

69784 the bjp has been compelled to decide that it will boycott cnn ibn and channels related to it till such time as the unedited tapes of the notes for votes scandal are telecast
69785 we are looking at a 34 0 result at fridays meeting of the iaea board of governors
69786 we are looking at a 34 0 result at tomorrows meeting of the iaea board of governors
69787 the best case scenario for us obviously is if there is no voting and the agreement is supported by the iaea board unanimously
69788 we will be pleasantly surprised if after making its opposition to the agreement public pakistan does not seek a voting even if to abstain it may not vote against the agreement but it may still abstain to record its position
69789 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
69790 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
69791 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
69792 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 percent or 30 percent or 18 percent
69793 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
69794 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
69795 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
69796 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year
69797 but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
69798 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
69799 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
69800 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
69801 to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
69802 and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
69803 it todays squad is a great purpose of showing the players that we are very happy with in regards to playing in the world cup and being involved in that australian team
69804 and also for the players that havent been picked and think they should be there its a great opportunity to show over the next six weeks plus semifinals that they have the form to warrant a position in the team
69805 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
69806 why is it they did not react this way before
69807 if people find it truthful we also print that so where is the bias
69808 i think it sought to embarrass the president or to shame the president at a time that she has not even given the sona
69809 i question the methodology and the way the question was phrased
69810 the way it was done it was not to reflect a public opinion it had something else in its objective
69811 i challenge the mores which is a respectable institution to look into a non member because the non member may be spreading wrong information which would destroy the integrity of other polling institutions that are doing their job
69812 i challenge pulse asia to submit itself to scrutiny by the experts and to see how the questions were framed the methodologies
69813 multistage probability sample of 1 200 adults 18 years old and over using face to face interviews
69814 what you get there is the sense of how difficult things are right now they cant even see it how its going to be improving in the coming year it gives you a sense of helplessness at the situation
69815 our guests are trying to avoid responsibility ive been pissed off with this investigation these people are not answering truthfully i think we should hold this people in contempt its an insult to this body
69816 we need one more hearing you know why we still have the bmi board of marine inquiry report we have to discuss the findings
69817 we find sulpicio lines accusing god i would also guess that the philippine coast guard is accusing congress because they said they have no authority because we have no law i dont know who pagasa will blame they say they are not remiss with their duties
69818 as if nobody is to blame or is it everybody to blame
69819 we want to approve a law before christmas to strengthen the maritime industry
69820 its been a while since the tragedy im wondering why no one has been taken responsible for it
69821 that is not enough it should be a deliberate search effort to look for these bodies and recover them it should be your liability period
69822 the way it looks its taking so much time mr go it will take a month before you recover the toxic cargo we would like you to keep this more priority effort
69823 we did not allow sulpicio to remove bodies simultaneously with the dead bodies the decision together with un united nations experts is to remove the toxic materials first we want to make sure that divers will not be exposed to any danger when they are under water
69824 titan has done two or three salvage ops in rp with harbor star as their partner we also did our own staff work to check integrity of partners we have also sought expert opinion from the internal maritime organization the dutch expert sat with titan and harbor star based on their recommendations they have the capability to do the star
69825 i know our investigation is centered on the passengers but please understand my people have suffered and are still suffering nobody wants to go fishing because nobody wants to eat fish with the endosulfan dead bodies in our shores
69826 what would it take or you to resist the governments offer
69827 i vehemently deny that he ever asked me what it takes to inhibit from the case nor give any reply in the manner that he stated in the affidavit
69828 sabio told me about the blandishments coming from the government side he sabio said that he was being offered a promotion to the supreme court and money to favor the gsis position
69829 i politely declined the offer and told the emissary that it was not only a matter of principle but that it will affect the integrity of the court
69830 that emissary frantically tried calling me to put an end to the pestering calls i told the emissary that to accept that offer would not only bother my conscience forever but also that i could not possibly face my wife my two daughters one a lawyer and the other a bar candidate as well as the rest of my family
69831 i called up justice sabio to chitchat on the meralco gsis sec case because it was hogging sic the headlines and to hear what was happening so to speak directly from the horses mouth
69832 i told justice sabio that it was obvious that the government was doing this in retaliation for the news coverage by abs cbn of the administration
69833 what would it take for you to resist the governments offer
69834 i was taken aback by the answer of justice sabio and the huge amount he had mentioned that i was at a loss for words to say
69835 i am not brokering for meralco they have my sympathies but i am not brokering for them
69836 on the contrary he told me that he was sent by manolo lopez who was with him in the car because it was a matter of life and death for them lopez family so they wanted the case to be ensured
69837 i was out of the country that day so it is impossible that i was waiting in the car for de borja as sabio claims
69838 used to be managing companies who has morphed into entrepreneurship
69839 among other things i have been engaged in the past in the sale and purchase of real properties manufacturing companies brokering contacts and in general deal making and project packaging from which i would stand to gain a fee for my efforts
69840 after i received my fee for the transaction i gave p300 000 to judge sabio in appreciation of the efforts he had undertaken towards the successful completion of the transaction
69841 he helped me consolidate the property so we would just be buying an entire block instead of separate properties he was close to a lot of prominent people in cavite he had the patience to talk to the claimants
69842 he was at the right place at the right time
69843 i had a fever so im a little flat at the moment i had a bad throat again like i had in houston the week before the masters and the fever came with it
69844 it wasnt quite as bad as houston but it knocked me around a little bit i wasnt feeling good this morning but through the turn i started to feel a little better
69845 im going to rest the rest of the week and make sure im in good shape for next week
69846 hes been sick the whole time so i finally got it
69847 it seems to be a year of firsts for me
69848 its a quick learning curve you sort of have to take it one step at a time and just play the golf is actually no different its just the atmosphere and the circumstances
69849 coming out in the christian ssa blog world but so far finding other brothers with similar struggles who can exhort one another has been a great source of encouragement
69850 sentiment is more focused on slowing demand rather than short term supply disruptions
69851 there is no breach of the hull no water getting in and no signs of any pollution
69852 ive been unable to make or receive calls on my mobile all morning
69853 after a 50 minute wait listening to the optus telephone on hold rubbish i was told by someone that service will be affecting quite a lot of melbournians at least till sic midday
69854 i am in sydney cbd and have not been able to do anything pretty much since this morning the network keeps coming on and off and when i have tried to sms or call it goes straight to no service
69855 decision to grant or deny the motion to withdraw is discretionary on the part of the judge
69856 i dont know if i am right about this but there is a gay party on tonight if you want to come i will be going
69857 well i dont know if you feel ready for that yet but you are always welcome
69858 lord i want to show by these actions that you are better than sinful pleasure i gladly do this work you called me to instead of doing the worthless sin i am tempted to
69859 if i told them i am attracted to them will they still be my friend
69860 if i told you i have ssa would you still love me or will you reject me
69861 if i told you i am attracted to you would you still love me or will you reject me
69862 is the desire to just get it off my chest for my benefit and it what is best for my friend
69863 will he like me if he knows im attracted to other guys
69864 will he like me if he knows i find him attractive
69865 i suppose they will always be there until i get over it and love myself i must remember that it is my life tomorrow is my life my day a day somehow and some way i shall find the joy in it i shall seek the joy of all the things i shall be who i am and i shall be it as much as i choose
69866 i am fleeing from their opinions and questions their honest and authentic lives
69867 god is this you i actually need right now is it you i need to know who loves me
69868 you have opened up your heart and bled all over your blog
69869 you make known to me the path of life in your presence there is fullness of joy at your right hand are pleasures forevermore
69870 even though my father played a genre completely different from mine i think he influenced me especially in the way of playing the piano
69871 i was very lucky to have a father like mine he was also a great friend
69872 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
69873 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
69874 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
69875 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
69876 in that sense hes going to have to move something he hasnt characteristically done in his entire career
69877 ik heb geluk gehad maar zij zijn er niet meer

69879 i am a stay at home mom heres how i finagled my finances make it happen this review is from the stay at home moms guide to making money how create the business thats right for you using the skills and interests you already have paperback
69880 if all these people can surely there is still hope that i can
69881 its not a new development but the problem is on the increase possibly because small off road bikes can be purchased relatively cheaply these days
69882 the bikes damage grass areas and tracks but our primary concern is safety
69883 people walk in these areas sometimes with very young children and are not expecting to come across motorbikes unless people stop riding in these areas it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt
69884 motorbikes are not toys despite the small size of some of the machines theyre fast and potentially lethal in the wrong hands and when ridden in the wrong place
69885 the first country to acknowledge unequivocally the legal rights of nonhumans
69886 to teach them how to recite the bill of rights
69887 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
69888 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
69889 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989
69890 things go on inside mccains head that rarely or never come out
69891 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
69892 our nation has a unique place in the world we are the greatest force for good on earth we chart historys course yes we must be involved in the destiny of other nations
69893 history of the decline and fall of the roman empire

69900 we are shifting our strategy to focus on retail products
69901 effective aug 1 we will no longer offer lease products in the united states
69902 you have got the dropping of the used car vehicle prices you have got people that are struggling with the credit crunch
69903 it is very difficult right now to offer competitive lease products so we are switching our strategy
69904 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
69905 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable

69907 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
69908 of course you can do the same thing on a pc
69909 and we believe this new institution of higher learning will have a great impact
69910 i want to run a recreation program for special needs kids
69911 i fell in love with the kids from the start
69912 during the off season i teach special education in the ashland schools
69913 the kids who work here get as much out of the experience as the campers
69914 my daughter had some of the counselors over at my house and they were worried because they needed more money
69915 i met with dick to find out what they needed and i said no problem
69916 we supply the facility support and they supply the day to day operations
69917 this is a model for any municipality can look at and see this is the way it should be done
69918 does the restraining order mean hell stay away from me
69919 the natick police are going to take this seriously and this court will take it very seriously
69920 you are not to call her you are not to write her a letter youre not to e mail her you are not to send her a birthday card
69921 the behavior included creeping through the victims yard sitting outside of her bedroom window and sometimes did climb on the victims roof and look through the skylights
69922 she related to me that he was very scary and he was repeatedly hitting her in the stomach at which time she covered her stomach and said dont hit me in the stomach
69923 he then pulled her hands away and began hitting her harder in the stomach
69924 i was afraid to get a restraining order because of what he would do to me and im so afraid of my life
69925 william has threatened my life hit me pinned me up against the wall locked me in his room slapped me all in an attempt to try to convince me to go back out with him
69926 without the age restriction this board would never grant this waiver
69927 there are not egregious conditions that would lead to health and safety issues
69928 unit owners do have an opportunity to mitigate the condos
69929 when you buy something in the state of massachusetts you should get what you buy
69930 when you buy something in the town of hudson you should get what you buy
69931 they have been the most passionate and keen participants in this unique tournament
69932 cricket is my passion i just love this game i hope i can contribute to the rockhampton campus winning saga
69933 a great way to make new friends have some fun and improve the standard of my own game
69934 there are people who think we should expand the 287 g program and use it every time we come across an illegal immigrant
69935 were not doing that were using the program as an investigative tool not as an immigration enforcement tool
69936 were using it to unmask criminals who are preying upon other immigrants and who otherwise would be undetected
69937 now we can find out their real identities through the databases and remove them before they commit a crime
69938 i was really concerned when i first heard about it
69939 but the framingham police have been very careful they focus only on criminals and people involved in violent crimes and theyre not using the program to identify illegal immigrants id be the first one to criticize the police if they start enforcing immigration laws
69940 i was very struck when i learned the framingham police had decided to do that program given the large brazilian population that lives there
69941 we want to protect the community by removing criminals we want to decrease crime and victimization
69942 the trust between the immigrant community and the framingham police department has increased dramatically
69943 i would not attribute this solely to the 287 g program but the totality of our strategies to develop a safe healthy and crime free community for all
69944 this award will help us take our work even further and even inspire our children and others to work with renewed dedication for the tribals here
69945 there was only one person that too a migrant from a neigbouring state who was ssc high school pass then we decided to start the school since education would help the tribals assimilate themselves faster into the social mainstream
69946 what hangs at a mans thigh and wants to poke the hole that its often poked before answer a key
