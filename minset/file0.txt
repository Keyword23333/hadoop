10 it is no longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multi mission platform and then limit its use to execute tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats as asymmetric threats continue to evolve so will traditional threats the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps
11 a capable ship which meets the requirements for which it was designed
12 the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile sm 2 sm 3 or sm 6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw the ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water than ddg 51 capability ddg 1000s advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivability however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and targeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability
13 for four weeks between may and june we had decc officers on 24 hour call in the field to respond to resident odour complaints and to monitor contributing factors such as location and wind
14 during the course of our investigations we located one industry where the odour controls were not working correctly and we are now making sure that the company rectifies this
15 both of these businesses are co operating with decc staff to help eliminate any potential contributions they may be making towards rutherfords odour issues and thats a very positive outcome
16 we were able to analyse four samples from our odour capturing canisters used during the survey however none of these came from residential areas and with the exception of the samples obtained from hunter water corporations sewer system were in fact typical of busy roads
17 based on the diversity of complaints both in odour types and location we knew that this would not be a simple matter of finding one single source instead it is most likely a combination of processes from a combination of industries
18 hopefully by working with the industries in rutherford to ensure that the correct odour controls are in place we can eliminate the offensive smells as much as possible
19 just notice your breath repeatedly constantly start with a few minutes do it regularly daily everyday no days off if you miss a day dont ruminate too much just pick it up and start again keeping it regular is very important it will bring order and a restfulness to your life off of the cushion as it were
20 i would like to speak a moment about this concept of community as a meditator you are not alone you are not selfish because you take the time to notice your thoughts in fact you will come to see if you sit with any real regularity and commitment that your time sitting will alter maybe even transform your life with others in very beneficial harmonious ways i do not want to give you the impression that everything will be perfect and pleasant henceforward no this is not any humans reality that i have met and i have met the lowest and the highest of the caste no i just wanted to make certain that you heard the report from the front lines as it were that you are not alone ever never no how
21 there is nothin like that crack of the bat at the park it is probably my favorite sound of the park its not the same on broadcast no matter what kind of system you put it through ambience echo cracker jacks i dont care if i ever get back
22 yah i picked this white one up last year i wear it when i think they are going to win i wear the grey when they are destined to lose i think ill have to wear the grey one more
23 so do you find you get more comments from people when you were either color
24 yah definetly the white one gets more guys staring at me those boys sneer occasionally at the grey one but the white one is more noticeable much more piratey looking if they ever drop the price on em or do another one hey maybe you and viv could do one with maybe less quality ah but youd probably go in the other direction and line em with sensors well maybe all i am saying is they could take off as a weird trend
25 exactly ok so what are your top ten fenway sounds today
26 in no particular order no wait i think i can order them
27 common ma can i get a coffee i am too old enough to drink
28 hey braid what can you tell me about the whereabouts of a guy named rockrock ring any bells
29 ya rockrock viv must have let on to you about the package i received the other day it was dropped in at her uncles place im not certain how anyone knew we were there but it was clearly for me for us and there was a picture the picture was of cocoa and me taken about a month ago
30 compro what no we were just having a snack down by the harbor
31 i mean anything technologically compromising like maybe how did that photo get taken without either of you knowing it was being taken that kind of compromising
32 oh yah well since you put it that way yes very compromising
33 oh in that instance yah i think i know who this rockrock person maybe
34 police are of the opinion that although the options of avos and the like are being pursued it will not deter those persons residing in willow drive from harassing the couple
35 police are fearful that the violence may get out of hand and the best way to avoid this is through relocation
36 vet tenants more thoroughly and not use our area as a dumping ground for troublemakers
37 but it wasnt like that for us last christmas when all my kids presents were broken or stolen and our house was damaged by fire
38 we had been out on christmas day returning to find our house had been trashed
39 we had been inside for only a few minutes before people began throwing bricks at the building
40 i ran out with my 18 month old baby in my arms my other children following
41 the taxi driver waiting for us was astonished at what was happening
42 our families are all safe now and i want nothing from anybody
43 but i feel i must speak up now or i will have it on my conscience forever if i keep quiet and someone is killed in willow drive
44 living there can be a nightmare and i feel so sorry for people who still live with all those troubles
45 i was targeted because i am against drugs so i became the worst person in the world to many people there
46 no one in the street will talk to police because they are so frightened
47 people are fighting all over the place and it is getting out of hand
48 the department of housing is putting bad people in here without checking on their past history
49 my idea of hell is being photographed so maybe we can consider this my therapy session but im really looking forward to seeing how the artists view me because hopefully theyll be kinder to me than i am on myself and thats part of the therapy
50 ive been listening to carol on the radio for years but ive never seen her so this has been a great experience
51 because when you listen to someone on the radio for quite some time you can get a preconceived idea of what the face on the end of that voice may look like
52 one of the things that makes it okay is that as opposed to being photographed youre being captured by someone else the only view of a photograph is the one you put on it yourself so this is my opportunity to see what other people see
53 also how often in life do you get to do something like this my reaction to the whole thing has been yes then no yes then no but its a great privilege i mean when was the last time someone rang up and said hey can i paint your head
54 and for people who have life long self esteem problems i think something like this helps even if they turn you inside out and flip you on your head
55 this is why i work in radio and not television
56 participants involved in this activity can look back proudly on their achievements knowing that their contribution created ongoing benefit to their community through assisting with the presentation and profile of a major tourist attraction of the hunter
57 get some training interact with other people and build their self esteem
58 the gaol is a state icon and the work for the dole project has not only been good for the participants in terms of giving them useful trade skills but its made an enormous contribution to the site
59 this course is slightly different its going to have a little more emphasis on problem solving and negotiation skills
60 it will give men better skills and strategies for resolving conflict so it doesnt escalate into something else
61 its for men in close domestic relationships through to men having problems in their workplace unemployed to professional people
62 younger men are more open to it i think its happening slowly
63 women are encouraged to talk about their feelings where men arent
64 this workshop will help men to identify and acknowledge what their feelings are
65 it was a bit of a surprise it just arrived
66 its a difficult thing for disability business services to market to the community because were so diverse and the community dont really have an understanding of what we do
67 the funding is a good recognition from the government that this is a worthwhile venture
68 disability services like mai wel need to market themselves and sometimes they have a limited capacity to do so
69 this is a one off grant to up their activity on the marketing side
70 this of course will hopefully grow their business and provide greater opportunities for them to expand
71 theres nothing more important in disability services than providing the challenge and opportunity to work in mainstream australia
72 the staff are very excited about going in as are the residents and the families
73 it brings us right up and into the 21st century
74 benhome provides a wonderful service to the local community and this further enhances what theyre able to do
75 all governments are appreciative of not for profit organisations like the one here helping to engage the local community in the financial support of these facilities
76 there shouldnt be any greater priority for government than to take care of elderly australians those who have contributed so much to the development of the nation
77 weve got a rapidly ageing population so governments generally are going to have to look in the future at investing more into aged care facilities
78 weve got an intergenerational challenge ahead of us to support older australians
79 it the care of elderly australians has to be a big focus theres no doubt that greater investments are required
80 when i started here 11 years ago we didnt have a call for it
81 about eight years ago it was identified and we put an eight bed unit in place

87 so do you know this rockrock person and what does the photo have to do with this
88 ya see back in the day i worked a few non commercial stations in new york boston and middle america this guy sounds pretty familiar but the degredation of the tape is muckin with my memory its throwing me off a bit it could have been a very good friend of mine using an alias and the tape warble is weird too ya know the whole alias alternate name thing that is the norm these days with so many folk in the online world was pretty much confined to terrestrial broadcast radio back then of course way back to the dawn of broadcast radio there were stage names and ghost writers but with radio the first mass electronic media fake names or alias were really something different the alive quality the live broadcast nature of the medium coupled with the intimacy of the audio in the ear of the listener really shifted persona frontin to a whole new realm
89 mr radio historia phila dr ya know could you just answer the question who is this guy
90 blaaaah ok so do you have any idea wait check that question how about will you be able to figure out who and what and why this recording was dropped here i mean it was literally airmailed and was that an eno track followed by firesign
91 well if that is me then why dont i remember
92 coop you had a pretty tough time out in california didnt you
93 well yah i suppose it was a tough year we flew and jumped a lot and i did hit the trees a few times more than i can ever remember doin in the past i think
94 well yah i would say that at least four or five times a season someone now not always someone sitting in my seats but someone within a few seats gets hit usually you dont see the blood but usually you dont have someone wearing a white silk top to the game silk really shows off blood
95 hey if you dont mind me asking braid how often do you sell your seats what you have had those season tickets for twenty or is it 30 years now
96 actually coop i only sit in my seats if it is the playoffs i sell or give away the seats to every regular season game i clear at least seventy six thousand a year selling the seats
97 yup it is a bit weahd but hey i actually prefer to stand and mill about during the game more action better people watching
98 well ya coop i been here a long time paid my dues sat through hundreds of games of sorrow with the sox have paid well maybe not hundreds but tens of thousands for tickets over the years keeping the season tickets in the fold and now well i deserve to make some of it back whilst the pink hats and silk patrons pay the gs for the seats
99 people watching indeed braid indeed get it while you can
100 hey can i have my antenna back im gettin a lot of echo
101 coop look i gotta go check on my patrons see if the silk splattered one is ok theyre calling me down hey let me just give ya a tip stay out of the tree climbing and try and dig up some of your old airchecks they will probably remind and jog a lot of memories for you and help explain the package delivery
102 you know where to find me and get rid of that wack snogue gear it cant be good for your rehab
103 hes been on the lam for four years and we were initially told he fled to mexico
104 from the information i got he was hiding keeping a very low profile
105 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
106 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
107 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
108 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
109 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
110 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
111 ahh you know how it goes just lookin but thanks doll
112 you know i hear that hundreds of times a day but
113 she has a yankees tattoo she has a yankees tattoo

127 morning hopefully youll get to the bottom of this mystery
128 we are committed to ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need in order to do their job
129 we still have a few concerns but not enough that would keep us from signing the bill
130 so the president will sign that as soon as they can get it to us
131 i have a responsibility to ensure that our state has enough money to pay its bills this is not an action that i take lightly
132 i have nothing to eat son i have been sleeping without food for days
133 hope is the power that gives us the power to step out and try
134 do you think i ever woke up in the morning surveyed my apartment and said maybe ill crank the tunes and jump on my couch for a while i dont think so
135 amazing wonderful and in most cases untrue stories about myself
136 a prototypical child of the electronic age he knows how to use the sound bite he will give you a sentence that will be tailored for you to put into your news broadcast he is a child of the age in that sense
137 this path im on now is only something i arrived at after having fully explored my own dickiness
138 why certain undisclosed charities would give money to pay overhead for what is essentially a charitable conduit
139 williams insists that whenever a person gives money for a particular charity 100 per of that money gets to the named beneficiary that may be true but it does not mitigate the fact that the vast majority of the overall money collected during 2006 went to administration
140 we charge nothing for donations collected online and even cover the credit card costs associated with each donation we rely on the support of generous donors and advertisers to provide this service
141 we have a responsibility to scrutinize all charitable endeavours to ensure that we are getting decent value for our dollar
142 the point of this letter is to emphasize both the general and specific importance of all of us making the effort to sign up so that our organs may be used after our death by others for whom they can be the gift of life and for the extra courageous and hearty there are organ and bodily donations that can happen while we are alive many people wait on lists desperately hoping for this miracle and any of us may find ourselves or a close loved one in need at some point in ourlives the sad fact is that a small fraction of the population has signed up to make such donations possible at least by the laws in bc without that few moments of paperwork our body parts will simply go to the grave or crematorium that follows and sign up asap if you live in another jurisdiction take a few minutes and find out how you can do the same consider forwarding this email to your friends your facebook site your network post on your blog or however you prefer lets create a wave of donors
143 hey it looks like this package is somehow attached to the dog
144 this package that you dragged me out to see it has this weird filament attached to it and it is attached to the dog
145 hey this stringy stuff is really weird its like really super strong and almost feels like silk hey did spiderman drop this package off or something
146 censorship is anathema to the very spirit of the olympic games which celebrates diversity emphasizes mutual respect and demands dispassionate unadulterated representation of each competition
147 china had promised to provide media covering the games with the same access and freedoms enjoyed at all other olympic games
148 the ioc cannot sacrifice the olympic ideals in the name of harmony with its host city
149 a lot of the money raised by givemeaning ends in my pocket
150 i have stumbled from one business and personal failure to another
151 the problem with the bible is that its had too many wikipedia edits
152 indeed i did young man wow it was a classic really still to this day one of the best comebacks ever
153 you know i remember watchin the game back in the early summer of 08 and it was just devastating couldnt believe it i was there sittin behind and beside jack and he was just so damn quiet damn quiet and arms folded steaming i mean he was having his usual crackin time at the game but he was beside himself by the time the laker had lost their 24 point lead in the forth quarter lost the lead in their own house their own court jacks own hardwood drinkin bottled water i thought hed pull his barker out and start shootin up the joint
154 hey uncle ank would you like any coffee or juice this morning
155 aaah ok doll ill have some of that pomegran night and cranberry
156 ya pomegran night and cranberry man that ray allen he played the entire game that game and and he had one of the most beautiful smooth as pond ice isolation driving layups at the end of the game to totally empty la just gorgeous the iso started above the three point line so it really looked like hollywood movie type play unfortunately for la they cast the wrong guy to play one on one with in that game ray allen smooth
157 ok here is your juice ank so coop do you remember the game anks talkin about
158 well i remember the story celtics come back from a 20 something deficit in la in game four ray allen plays all 48 posey and house have huge contributions pierce and garnet their usual great and strong selves another amazing celtics lakers playoff game
159 oh come on coop it was not just another amazing playoff game
160 did you just say you were a competitive yoga fan cocoa
161 har har you were listening to me hey ank one of coops associated parachuted this package in this mornin and we are just dying to listen to this weird tape that came along with it do you mind
162 oh right right sorry to have interrupted kids ill take my juice and zilla and go see how the espalier are coming in
163 i asked as i adjusted the cart in the slot
164 said cocoa as she opened the silken wrap around her hips and let the sun shine in as we prepared to finally listen
165 yah i just found it looks kinda interesting and familiar
166 hey is that marblehead maybe around singing beach or is that
167 hey i know who and where that picture was taken
168 that photo you are cradling in your skimpily laced lap is
169 so coop which associate of yours would parachute a package to you on a sunday
170 well i know of a lot of people who would fancy the idea but those folks would be more interested in dropping bombs or incendiary devices which i guess could still be inside the package but there is only one person who would fashion a parachute from old radio station banners and drop it a total radio monkey but that person is dead or so i thought
171 yah lets open that after we get the food on the table i could kill for a plate of our eggs bacon and the asparagus what we have been waiting for for over what has it been two years three to eat from our own patch the package can wait a bit cant it
172 oh sure coop im not hungry anyway but you do look a bit pale you sure you ok that was quite a fall how is the new leg and ankle holding up
173 ok so can we now open that package that has been staring at me this whole dang breakfast
174 so coop is that it just a strange mix of shredded stuff
175 well that my lovely is a honest to goodness radio cart machine
176 a cart machine is a specialized auto cue quarter inch tape playing machine commonly used in radio broadcasting through the dawn of computer digital playing mechanisms
177 woe spock that is quite enough fine i get it so who and why would someone send you this thing
178 well i was known by some folk to have an uncommon love for the things
179 ok so coop honey why would someone send you one
180 just look at this thing it weighs about ten pounds it has real plastic buttons and it smells like a cybernetic dinosaur nice oil i bet this is pure marvelous oil in some ways these machines remind me of my 3g iphone
181 coop look my power points are getting burnt out here with all the uv today i just need to know if you need any help with anything else im about done hearing about the cart machine as it will be a while until you clue me into what led caused or who did this parachute drop thing you can unravel your package yourself unravel your package hey actually i think your own package may be getting burned out here too your kimono is a bit loose hon
182 would you look at the heads on this deck they are in good shape i wonder
183 umm ok why i didnt fall that hard really hey this cart machine is actually attached to a battery powered supply already and here is a cartridge
184 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants
185 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
186 it s easy to use and it offers a lot of applications
187 i can t wait to actually see it in use in the field
188 the real beauty of it is that the technology has been designed so that anyone who hasn t had any training on it can use it
189 the government of japan believes that stringent measures taken to relieve the two officers showed a serious stance from the u s side in regards to the fire
190 the government of japan understands that the navys investigation was conducted professionally and objectively
191 we are stunned and cant help feeling shivers going down our spines
192 for local stuff i dont drive as much ill get on a train
193 ill take the free garrison bus from panzer casern to patch barracks to do grocery shopping
194 my kids take the bus whenever they need to go to the hub a teen hangout at patch barracks or to a movie
195 you do quite a bit of driving when you live out here
196 i havent noticed us cutting down we have a hybrid for our other car and that helps
197 well never see 2 a gallon again id be happy to see 3
198 by pricing gas using a market based system were able to be more consistent with gas prices
199 taking into consideration the spiking price of oil and the weak value of the dollar to the euro this surcharge is being reviewed
200 we will make every effort to ensure the surcharge is the amount required to cover overhead costs nothing more nothing less
201 and if they thought there was any profit theyd be on us like a ton of bricks
202 we are purchasing the fuel in euros and the overhead costs often are paid in euros
203 please take into consideration whilst the price of oil increases the purchasing value of the dollar has decreased 37 percent in five years on our side had the dollar remained as it were five years ago we would be paying 37 percent less
204 we kept the patient comfortable with high doses of antibiotics and painkillers but medevac was the only option we had for definitive treatment
205 network comprised of machines under the control of a single user
206 criminal activity such as spam e mail identity theft denial of service attacks and spreading malware to other machines on the internet
207 i havent seen any reservations canceled yet that we have made
208 it is quite a busy time but most of the carriers we use are american carriers anyway
209 for the temporary duty or transferring travelers hopefully they will be ok when going to the states
210 maybe later if the strike keeps going it could be worse
211 years of inaction at the dod continue to speak volumes about senior leaderships commitment to our servicemembers and civil servants
212 when it comes to sexual assault in the military the dod has absolutely no credibility
213 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier
214 i can assure you the army treats this very very seriously
215 civilians are not afforded the same protections as active duty military personnel after suffering an assault
216 if i knew then what i know now i cant say for sure i would have reported it
217 we keep thinking that the dod would get it by now but they dont
218 were looking at about a 2 billion price tag for relocation and building an entirely new line
219 if you add more train miles to a route for the railroad youll make trucking more attractive than railroad service so if thats the case youll have more trucks on the roads and people dont want to see that
220 this was a pretty serious safety issue that we are going to correct
221 loss of confidence in his ability to command and his failure to meet mission requirements and readiness standards
222 we found cigarette butts where we shouldnt have found them
223 the fire and the subsequent magnitude of the fire were the result of a series of human acts that could have been prevented
224 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
225 americans want a respectful campaign people say negative ads move numbers they may but do we have to go to the lowest common denominator i dont think so
226 we need to provide ore to the construction side of the operation to then commission the plant
227 we shouldve by now already started that process but because of the delay in terms of relocating the power diversion around this property we now are out of kilter with what it is we should be doing in preparation for the mining
228 it is wonderful to see many grape varieties collecting medals indicating the region can produce wine that is as good as any in australia
229 i congratulate peter and anne jeffery of spring ridge on their trophy for the best chardonnay of the show which has consolidated cowras position as one of the top chardonnay regions in australia
230 the best local wine of the show went to a shiraz and silver medals were won by viognier and semillon among the bronze medals we had a merlot cabernet sauvignon chardonnay shiraz shiraz viognier verdelho and a chardonnay semillon blend
231 bathurst forming a menshed in bathurst is a good idea
232 we have seen our membership jump from 30 members to 80 and many have formed great friendships
233 we would like to see the youth come here and we could teach them how to build and create things we are looking to do an outreach course with tafe so people can learn how to use computers and we may have work for the dole people come here as well
234 you can really see the progression the involvement and desire by the members to help young people is just fantastic and almost seems like a natural thing for groups like menshed to do
235 we have received several grants and some of that money will be used to purchase new computers
236 while its hot and dry the water supply level is very solid
237 most people dont realize the impact cattle has on the state economy
238 its the largest agricultural industry in the state and right now theres a rise in ranchers who feel they need to cut their losses
239 he told me he hadnt played offensive line since middle school i tell you what junior guard nick charles and a couple of those older kids have done a good job just kind of crash coursing him
240 he can move and he can bend and hes aggressive
241 it gives him a little bit better chance to play
242 i just dont think you can have a bunch of quarterbacks i think youve got to pick who your top two or three are and those are the guys you need
243 weve got a lot of young guys so theres going to be a lot of anticipation a lot of guys ready to step up and play
244 so theres definitely a lot of emotion going around so thats good
245 this group will have a great work ethic and this group will have a great spirit about it
246 now what weve got to do is get to the point where we play well
247 this time last year we had a lot of them that were absolutely clueless because everything was new
248 just the difference a year makes in the system were light years from where we were terminology wise and mentally
249 youre able to get into a lot more detail sooner
250 last year you were just trying to teach them the big picture where at least now theyve got a little bit of a grasp of it and you can be a little more thorough

258 no it cant be real i was in my flat last moment i remember no it cant be true how can i
259 ohh its just my mobile i threw on the niks bed
260 ohh i was about to tell you mom rohan just called me and asked to come to his room he has some new cds
261 i wonder if it hurts when i throw them at her
262 i will be there in few more minutes aadi please wait for me
263 how come you didnt notice me coming this time aadi
264 keeper ja da er du faktisk den andre keeperen vi har hatt her oppe p scenen som har triksa men det er kanskje ikke s trygt ha en keeper som trikser for da pluttselig s stor du der og trikser i m l og pluttselig s bare v
265 s gjorde han s nn greier med armer og bein og jeg fikk s j vlig latterkrampe oppe p scenen xd haha
266 i remember when bernard hopkins was challenging me and at that time i was a welterweight and he was fighting as a light heavyweight and he called me out
267 as a fighter i felt i had to challenge him so i did now manny pacquiao is challenging me and i am definitely considering it
268 we were watching an espn 2 show a few weeks ago and they mentioned that brian minto amp kevin johnson were two of the top five american heavyweights but eddies name wasnt on the list come on now minto couldnt hit eddie with a handful of rice
269 i started bernard hopkins and i managed former super middleweight champion steve little and eddie has more natural talent than anyone i have managed
270 i see guys like ruiz valuev toney amp barrett getting opportunity after opportunity and that shuts out guys like me who lost one fight that i know i could have and should have won
271 james is a very fan friendly fighter whose body attack alone makes him entertaining every time out his vast wealth of amateur experience provides a solid foundation for him hes the type of fighter who adds value to every card he appears on
272 i love his body punching when you combine that with his tenacity in the ring it is hard to imagine him ever being in a bad fight
273 that shows me that james is a real fighter i hope to do lots more fights with him in the future he was willing to get right back on the horse against a guy who is not a pitty pat opponent
274 james is a very rugged and crowd pleasing fighter he sells a lot of tickets and has a lot of enthusiastic fans he generates excitement
275 theres no doubt that james can come back and be a world champion someday hes very strong willed and has a ton of guts and determination ill be rooting for him hes a dynamite fighter and a great guy
276 this time last year i was supposed to be fighting a legitimate ex champ in kassim ouma on a pay per view undercard
277 that fight got cancelled but this time im in against a more respected ex champ in vernon forrest a future hall of famer and our fight is the co feature so its an even bigger fight
278 this time around were fighting on my side of the tracks which means ill come with more aggression and more machismo i know vernon will come with more hunger but im a young hungry undefeated champion now and im going to stay that way
279 he fought a great fight but he fought a vernon forrest who was at 45
280 i had a bad night that night i had a terrible night the worst of my career it was like i was fighting in quicksand but on sept 13th mora will fight the vernon forrest he expected in june ill be at 100
281 everyone who faces me says that the truth is that i have a difficult style and they find that out first hand when they fight me
282 all his style did was make for an ugly stinky fight to watch and it was even more ugly to participate in it takes two to make a good fight and i couldnt give anything to make it a good fight i felt like i stunk out the joint that night
283 its a misconception that i got old or that i took him lightly
284 this time ill limit how much ill train for the fight
285 i could have done more in the first fight because i knew what he was going to do its just that physically i couldnt adapt to what he did after four rounds i had nothing
286 hes a master at holding without the referee seeing he holds and he tries to headbutt and elbow on his way in he even kneed me in the chest during one clinch thats why i hit him behind the head so i could draw attention from the ref vernon knows every trick in the book
287 i think its going to be a more exciting fight this time
288 i see in his eyes that i hurt his pride by beating him
289 im going to be more aggressive im going to throw more right hands and go to the body im not going to hold back like i did the first time its mexican independence day weekend so i dont mind being a little macho or spilling a little blood
290 i knew it was going to happen the eventual stoppage of cotto ive sparred with margarito for years sometimes he has good days sometimes i have good days but its always a war with him
291 i remember the first time i sparred with him was in 1999 in oscar de la hoyas camp for ike quartey
292 its been our goal to continue to bring exciting las vegas style boxing to this area since the beginning five years ago we have worked tirelessly to entertain the great boxing fans of this area by putting together some of the most exciting fights out there this saturday will be a culmination of all the hard work we have put forth these past five years we are going to pay our respects to the past of one in a million and look towards the future
293 she knows about it people have told her but she hasnt seen it and she doesnt plan to
294 shes on tour with benji madden and isnt watching television and has not been on the internet
295 but shes already said shes not too happy about it
296 i have fought some rough and tough fighters but hes the dirtiest fighter there is
297 there was no way he was gonna beat me anyway
298 i was too smart too fast too experienced if i kept on hitting him i would have killed him
299 if perry thinks that hector did something illegal then it should be taken to appeal
300 he does absolutely anything to get you off your game
301 he head butted me so much i have a crack in the front of my skull
302 the video and my medical records will vindicate me 100 percent
303 and there you see him hit cotto when hes on the ground
304 you know that tito wouldnt have went out like that

311 come into his bedroom uninvited to harass and start arguments
312 forcefully by the arm held him against his will and did not let him get away from her

321 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
322 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
323 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
324 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour

334 hellboy is a character who is going someplace and i can hint about where hes going but i cant let you see it yet
335 he is not a filmmaker who is going to be slavish to the source material
336 my idea is that hellboy has been all over the world
337 i try not to write myself into a corner and allow things to expand even now every book i do im throwing certain pieces out there
338 we hit the level of shakespearean melodrama that i was really pleased with
339 theres a bit in christmas underground where an old ladys dying theres this one panel where hellboy puts his hand on top of her hand because he knows shes going to die and he knows theres nothing he can do about it and the best he can do is hold her hand

365 there is going to be a relaxing of the dress protocols and people are being encouraged to wear lighter clothing
366 i dont want to get involved in the fashion police of determining exactly what people can wear but the encouragement of business casual is where we are going
367 we have not accepted any of the proposals the government is now getting organised this is a normal process
368 this is not a question for me but for the prime minister it is the prime minister who is shaping the government
369 it is not my place to say how long this will take
370 this is not expected to have a negative impact on kyoto implementation
371 the focal point for kyoto questions remains the economy ministry as far as i know that hasnt changed
372 everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
373 china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
374 developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
375 telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
376 in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
377 that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
378 china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
379 the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader
380 if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market
381 if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
382 i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night
383 opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
384 on the oxygen side it doesnt work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the oxygen out
385 its cheap its efficient its highly manufacturable its incredibly tolerant of impurity and its from earth abundant stuff
386 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
387 obamas solution to americas energy crisis is inflating tires maybe hes been out of the country too long
388 running a tire 20 percent underinflated only 5 to 7 pounds per square inch psi can increase fuel consumption by 10 percent that can easily cost motorists two or three miles per gallon not only that but running underinflated also reduces the tires tread life
389 why do they act that way a survival guide to the adolescent brain for you and your teen
390 i know our generation is going to make it through life with jobs and being financially stable val but i worry about the children
391 you and i have made it growing up through the depression as children ourselves and as young adults through a world war our own parents certainly had cause to worry about us too
392 our kids will survive adapt to their surroundings and thrive in love and life as much as fate permits
393 im so excited im so anxious this is what ive been waiting for for a year
394 out of the two years weve been married we spent 5 months together
395 go to the beach with him go to chuck e cheeses and busch gardens
396 because we are not used to this kind of event just the gruesomeness of it is a bit like experiencing an earthquake the ground beneath you psychologically never feels quite secure again
397 people get so caught up in the memories of it it just affects who they are on a day to day basis
398 my government blew through my doors and killed my dogs
399 they thought we were drug dealers and we were treated as such i dont think they really ever considered that we werent
400 only celebrities like barack obama demand bottles of an organic brew black forest berry honest tea
401 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that what is worthy of the american people
402 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
403 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
404 he can inspire the country to greatness this tomfoolery needs to stop
405 because we have research and development expertise and focus on 10 disease states
406 i dont think wed like to be exclusively biotech but were certainly moving more in that direction
407 there are an awful lot of biotechs with market capitalizations under 1 billion
408 we are reviewing it and once weve had a chance to do that well consider whether the decision should be appealed
409 ill vote for obama because we need a democrat in the white house
410 the best way that we can stand up for you is to make sure we have a democratic president taking the oath of office on jan 20 2009
411 seen his passion his determination his grace and his grit
412 there are a lot of folks still on the sidelines trying to make up their minds
413 if were going to have a president that respects unions
414 theres quite a few of us on the fence im not the only one a lot of her supporters are there
415 right now obama is saying shes low on the list well decide what to do if he doesnt choose her
416 i was thinking she would win and she slid back and i was really disappointed
417 i definitely want to see a democrat in the white house
418 he wasnt my first choice but thats the choice now
419 she stood strong and tall and im glad shes supporting barack obama
420 she has integrity and shes a lady of her word
421 they have to focus on electing a democrat mccain is not union friendly
422 if youre electing him youre putting bush back in the white house
423 weve now touched it and tasted it and id like to say that it tastes very fine
424 there were a lot of champagne corks popping in the downlink room last night
425 the extended mission will be time to explore other areas within reach of our robotic arm
426 were very pleased to see we landed right on top of water ice
427 this is good news for us the ice could have been around us but not near or right under us we hope to be able to answer the question is this a
428 although many things have changed you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother
429 we both love her dearly and have only her best interests and well being in our hearts i ask you now please please bring snooks back
430 there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
431 we didnt have a lot of time to get it done so it tends to move a lot faster the last 24 hours i was surprised they obviously had a need for another bat in their lineup and a need for another outfielder i know white sox gm kenny williams had interest in junior in the past and looked at this as a good opportunity to add him to his club
432 he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it i think its a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
433 it was a lot more brief than i thought it was going to be
434 it was kind of shocking all of sudden bam it was done he is still going to be a friend of mine im upset that hes leaving but its a good situation for him he wants to win a ring the white sox are in first place and he has a chance
435 he wasnt having his best year but he was just getting hot
436 you wont be able to fill those shoes no one is ken griffey jr its the end of an era in cincinnati he got hurt a lot but was one of the top five best to ever step on the field
437 hes one of the best four or five hitters in baseball
438 i like him yet he marches to his own drummer i had him in the all star game it doesnt make sense to me that he would be available
439 we had some things that we were looking at that we were trying to improve mainly with the pen and we did that with rhodes
440 we were trying to add catching depth and we banged on i think every door if we didnt its our fault as far as any other opportunities yes there were other opportunities that we wanted to explore because we like to be active with the minutes ticking we wanted to take advantage of it why some of those things didnt come to fruition could be a number of factors it could be the money the players to somebody else had different goals than we did
441 we had conversations that went right down to the wire
442 and whenever you have that obviously you feel like theres a chance but it takes two teams and by definition trades are difficult to make and weve worked extremely hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a pick and improve the team but at the end of the day we didnt find something that lined up for us
443 i know there was a lot out there the way we view that is that the trade deadline is an opportunity for us to examine ways to improve our club we did that we had a lot of discussions a few of them led right up to the deadline but obviously nothing came to fruition
444 we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point were i was calling owner tom hicks for the final signoff
445 the last four or five days obviously weve been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios
446 but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal
447 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
448 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
449 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
450 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
451 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
452 improper functioning of the delta subunit could impair the gaba systems ability to adapt to hormone fluctuations during the highly vulnerable post partum period
453 targeting this subunit might be a promising strategy in developing new treatments for postpartum depression
454 were eating this same produce in mexico and we havent had any problems
455 reuters is carrying an article about a recent mit development which may pave the way for solar energy to be collected for use in low input periods
456 with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
457 though until i hear a confirmation of mits findings from another university respected source i hold on to my severe doubts about this
458 with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
459 noceras catalyst is made from cobalt phosphate and an electrode that produces oxygen from water by using 90 percent less electricity than current methods which use the costly metal platinum
460 its always a tough decision when you leave an organization like detroit
461 it was a wonderful ride for 15 years i spoke with all the people i worked with including the ownership and they understand the situation is an opportunity to come to chicago to be with stan
462 when i first started with the blackhawks it was in the back of my mind but i kind of set it aside and wanted to go about and get my career in motion
463 the free agent signings of the blackhawks caught my attention but you also have to develop your own players
464 i can be another set of eyes for dale and denny and the organization
465 with the outdoor game against detroit everything kind of goes together
466 im really looking forward to getting this thing to where it should be
467 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
468 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
469 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
470 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
471 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
472 to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
473 and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
474 its tough to beat a guy like that with a second serve
475 we believe the case will be solved if we can find this man
476 even if they arrest me what could they charge me with they have been on a month long fishing expedition and not caught any fish
477 i dont expect this case to be solved any time soon
478 with full support from azizah as well as the pas and dap leadership and our friends in permatang pauh i am offering myself as an mp for the constituency
479 actually selangor menteri besar tan sri khalid ibrahim had offered bandar tun razak so did azmin ali with his gombak seat they are all safe seats including the one in kulim
480 if it looks very safe please convey that to umno
481 where hydro power is concerned zambia has a lot of potential as for biofuels there are several types of crops that can be turned into fuel
482 we have found zambia to have potential it has political stability and leadership that is committed and farsighted it also has a wealth of resources
483 i believe there is a good opportunity for malaysia to be involved in zambias growth
484 there are several major projects to be implemented in zambia first of all the government wants to make lusaka a cargo hub it also wants to build an inland port and a transportation corridor linking the country with major ports in africa
485 there is also the plan for a multi functional trade zone this trade zone will not only have factories but also research and development facilities
486 the investigation papers have been submitted to the chambers for further action but i do not know the contents
487 no doubt i am the minister in charge but i am not in the habit of finding out the contents because that is not my job
488 let the due processes take place under the law anwar is innocent until proven guilty
489 there should be no talk about charges or him being arrested
490 the police have completed their investigations and the papers have been submitted
491 it is up to the chambers to decide whether to press charges against him or not
492 conducting a trial for the public to make a decision on the case
493 i think when you have a mob court it will be very difficult to uphold justice
494 islamic tourism is a niche market which is growing in volume and significance in challenging times we need to adjust accordingly and take into account the global economic environment
495 your initiative to push for islamic tourism is an idea whose time has come
496 it wasnt really fair for him ivan that he didnt play in the glass court before this i could see he was struggling in the glass court he was seeing the ball quite slow
497 furthermore permatang pauh is anwars home base which his wife pkr president datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail won even in 2004 at the height of bns popularity
498 she has failed the rakyat she has proven she is unfit to serve the people
499 the people can see for themselves our contributions pr has done nothing they have not helped the malays especially those in the rural areas
500 everyone has been talking about the discussions and their opinions are varied i fear we may go astray from the original objectives of the talks
501 that is why i think we should let the leaders of both parties hold formal meetings to discuss matters of importance to umno and pas
502 we could discuss fundamental issues such as religion and leave politics out
503 such moves would only lead us to lose focus and force us to talk on old issues that have been a hindrance to closer relations between umno and pas
504 if all is made known then it would become discussions via the media
505 there is no basis for the state assembly to demand such a thing
506 what right do they have to ask the federal government to pay them for the projects
507 this is all just a political ploy by pakatan rakyat
508 i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and saddam hussein
509 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
510 it is great to be back here this is my favourite country the people are friendly and very giving with their smiles
511 it depends on how often we eat out usually its once or twice every weekend
512 its better to go to regular sellers they recognise you and will keep the prices reasonable
513 it further alleged that i had sold out and compromised gerakan the terms sold out and compromised the party essentially means that i have betrayed the party and cannot be trusted with the leadership of gerakan
514 i just dont know how a book that tells the gerakan story can be interpreted as an attempt to defame someone
515 we fully support anwar and the party will mobilise its machinery to ensure his victory
516 i was informed about this development much earlier we will support him all the way
517 i have lost twice i dont think the party will field me again
518 i am a fighter i will fight for whoever the party fields as a candidate
519 i have no problems with ezam former anwar ibrahim aide and pkr youth chief ezam mohd nor contesting the seat i think he will be a good candidate
520 even the performance of the penang government since the elections is an issue
521 we call it rezeki harimau we sometimes get a good catch or none at all i will spend more on groceries whenever i get siakap seabass or kerapu garoupa in big quantities
522 we will keep more of these items before the rainy season my wife knows very well when to stock up on groceries
523 i have to do it as i want my family to have good meals every day
524 we have gone through hard times when there was no food at home i dont want my children to beg for food from relatives again
525 theres nothing much to buy except fresh produce and items like milo and condensed milk
526 it may raise eyebrows but my husband and children sometimes want to try other types of fish particularly selayang and kembong
527 these types of fish are cheaper compared to stingray siakap and kerapu that my husband catches its better for him to sell the fish as we can get more money
528 pas rejects any form of cooperation with umno or bari san nasional at state or federal level we will not be forming any government with them this is no longer an issue
529 there is nothing secretive any more we can have meetings and the party would be notified of the meetings all this while the party had been informed of the meetings
530 we want uthayakumar to say that the medicine he had with him appeared in the police search list but it was missing in the detention centres list
531 he had the medicine when he was moved there we are dealing with a mans life
532 the court is ready to hear it and so is the senior federal counsel but you are giving all sorts of excuses
533 if you want this man to be either set free or admitted to a hospital you should proceed now if this was a civil court and you didnt follow the case management directions i would have thrown this case out it is a waste of time to file more affidavits
534 the idea is to put it all into written submissions because there are too many affidavits
535 as it is the court has been pushed and pressured just to suit lawyers
536 i admit that i did it but i did not intend to threaten
537 this is a serious offence you have taken advantage of a familys grief your action has caused them a lot of worry
538 the court is not here just to give out punishments it is also to teach lessons
539 he earns an income of rm450 and supports his four school going siblings he is remorseful of his action and will not do it again
540 he could be thinking that as the former member of parliament there he would still enjoy good support from voters dr wan azizah took over the seat from anwar and she is now giving way to him
541 we expected him to contest in permatang pauh although previously anwar said he might stand in bandar tun razak or kulim bandar baharu this shows that he has been misleading the people
542 i do not think permatang pauh is really a safe seat for anwar taking into consideration all the controversies involving him at present
543 having a by election involves a lot of work at this time we should be focusing on solving the problems faced by the people and not on pursuing ones personal ambitions
544 they are treating permatang pauh as a family playground where they can simply pass the baton as and how they like
545 maybe we should identify a new candidate and not someone who had previously contested there and lost what is important is that he or she must be a party member
546 umno has gone through various challenges i believe that our machinery would be able to fight against anwar
547 in the march general election the voters did not reject umno totally what we have to do is to convince them as to why they must support umno and barisan nasional
548 the general election was just held five months ago barisan nasional would give a strong fight this time around as now the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawis leadership is more stable
549 we in mic are also stronger with our continuous rebuilding and we will give our full support to ensure victory
550 even if anwar wins it will not make any difference as barisan nasional would still continue to rule the country
551 but when i read these right finger i always carefully consider the good price because i can always get the s ads and the retailers descriptions
552 ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
553 my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since
554 i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
555 i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
556 ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
557 i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it
558 if i could describe the new national defense strategy in one word it would be balance
559 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
560 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
561 we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
562 we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
563 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
564 we cant afford to make any mistakes because that would jeopardise the entire production
565 i cant imagine having to work on this project without them kar lai wong and chong
566 we are certainly looking to this match with great hope
567 i am very proud and honoured to have won this award which would not have been possible without the support of my parents azman hassan and rozita ibrahim and my coach lan wei of china
568 im surprised to have won this award as it is my first of this kind but i hope to use this to inspire to win my pet events the uneven bars and balance beam at the asean schools championships
569 my team and i have been working on super tight schedules since the show started there is hardly any room for us to breathe between each episode
570 honestly styling is one of the toughest jobs around but it doesnt discriminate they love you and your work because you make them beautiful inside and out its not all about hanging out with celebrities or anything like that
571 we are working under a lot of constraints and stress i constantly remind my team to keep within the dress code as it would determine the success of the show
572 the backstage normally transforms into a war zone every week we cut snip and even burn some of the costumes to achieve the perfect look for the contestants two weeks ago jimmy had to burn a corset to de stress the lace and mind you the garment looked good after that
573 oh my it was so funny as i had the half ready hat perpetually placed on my head while i continued altering it in front of the mirror at home the whole night
574 the participation of these team from the asia pacific region proves that the universitys aim to go global is producing positive results
575 the winds were medium to strong 12 18 knots and later in the afternoon the waters got rather rough
576 we sailed for about an hour and a half then decided to head in to avoid damaging the mast in a capsize but not before some radical downwind surfing
577 when we got onshore we were advised to lash down our boats as the winds were predicted to get stronger overnight
578 i have not had any problems with my boat but i may have to wait a couple of days since few people will sail with their racing spars in the strong winds predicted for the next two days
579 our plan tomorrow today will be dependent on what the weather looks like and i suspect the gym and pool are going to be popular for most of the day
580 no point trying to be a hero before the battle actually begins
581 we are not happy at all im not sure if muraleedharans job will still be secure after the council meeting as his position as coach will definitely be discussed
582 we have less than a year to prepare the players for the junior world cup
583 if new blood should be injected and coaches be replaced then we will go ahead
584 however we are disappointed with the 102 former internationals for not speaking to us first
585 we would have taken them seriously and considered their proposals
586 however we are not holding any grudges as whats done is done and we must now look ahead
587 we are aware that several parties have received copies of the petition but as for now we are prepared to work with these players regardless what comes next
588 i heard they are interested to contribute through the grassroots and we welcome their ideas
589 i cant comment on the players meeting with sultan azlan shah and mazlan we will just wait and see
590 all reports regarding the coaches and players performance and also documents on the countrys coaching system since 2006 have been given to jegathesan to review
591 what we are doing is collaborating with the mssm the idea is good as teachers will be more involved in coaching and umpiring
592 i would love to race against him but i dont think i would be drawn in the same heat as him
593 the top swimmers will all be grouped into the seeded championship heats and my times wont get me into those heats
594 i said that about the world championships in melbourne last year and i dont think it is going to be any different in beijing
595 it will also be the toughest to make the semis the toughest to make the finals and the toughest to win
596 whether that results in world records all the time or whether the world records will come in the finals i think were going to have to wait and see what happens
597 it wont be a two horse race between australia and the united states i mean you look at countries like britain japan the french the south africans they perform very solidly
598 theyve made changes from going to the semis to the finals to lower medals to gold medals theres a major shift in world swimming
599 i think it is disappointing that someone comes in there and literally steals one of the most exciting moments of the games
600 this is a great surprise and i have not heard of this happening before
601 we are disappointed and frustrated with the broadcast by sbs
602 its no secret that were not satisfied by how the last five races went
603 i was particularly disappointed after the series montreal magny cours silverstone in each one of these races i had the possibility to win but because of one thing or another things didnt go the right way and i lost
604 i never let myself be influenced by tension and i wont start now ive just to keep my focus and continue to give as much as possible race after race thats what ive done every time i was in trouble
605 its still much too early to make any forecasts for the championship considering that the first three drivers are only seven points apart the positions can change in a single race
606 and its useless to cry over spilled milk we are looking ahead with eight races to go and at the end well do the maths we just passed the halfway point of the season so its important to always gain points
607 excluding hockenheim i was always in a position to win and i hope success will come soon
608 the race at hockenheim was the most difficult moment of the season
609 i was really frustrated and disappointed that i couldnt find the right balance of the car but now were in a much better position
610 we had a productive test at jerez especially on the second day the team have done some great work in the development of the f2008 and im confident for hungary
611 i love the circuit and it is a great city budapest so i am looking forward to it very much and i just hope for another good result
612 i wasnt really quite sure i wanted to come and the reason i came is because my kids would kill me if i didnt
613 i was playing so bad that it wasnt even fun
614 i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
615 what almost killed umno in the last elections is not the leaders but the supporters who leech on them to further their own personal interests
616 if the leadership does not listen to us now i can guarantee we will continue to lose seats in the 13th general election
617 you would be shocked at how many members and leaders did not go out to vote
618 during the general election a supreme council member will ask whether weve eaten whether we are tired whether we are okay now they tell us what resolutions we can and cannot adopt
619 there was this resolution by a branch that wanted all umno ministers wives to wear the tudung
620 that was not passed as the division felt it was not the partys place to force them to do it
621 but every resolution passed or adopted will be in the annual general meeting report
622 if your resolution is not accepted you can still request that it be debated at the division meeting and this request will be put to a vote if you get enough votes from all the divisions at the meeting it will be accepted and debated
623 these days branch members are professionals and they know the partys history and its constitution if i want to be a delegate to the division they will ask me what im about and whom i support for this or that post
624 if i do not answer correctly i will not be chosen and the person who best represents their aspirations will be and that delegate will go to the division and have a hand in forming the partys direction
625 the extremely high subsidies by the us have caused serious damage to cotton farmers in developing countries including those in africa and 150 million in china
626 we believe that the us is not in a position to discuss with developing countries members cotton tariffs until they eliminate their cotton subsidies
627 one of the most reactionary farm bills in the history of the us
628 i come from a country where 300 million people live on us 1 a day and 700 million people live on us 2 a day so it is natural for me and in fact incumbent upon me to see that our agricultural interests are not compromised you dont require rocket science to decide between livelihood security and commercial interests
629 its unfortunate that in a development round we couldnt agree to an issue of livelihood and security
630 looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty
631 i was living in akita at the time i fitted in almost immediately met numerous great jazz musicians and was blown away by their skills
632 over here the scene is totally different but it is full of promise
633 they come not just to be entertained but also to learn about the music
634 so youd have to know your audience or youd end up disappointing them
635 i wanted to connect with my listeners and before you knew it japan became home to me
636 i paint for a living and not as a hobby
637 i called him at the hotel when dylan answered the phone i was tongue tied i eventually composed myself and told him of my intention
638 he told me to drop it off at the reception and offered complimentary tickets for me and my husband it was awesome
639 im looking forward to this gig because i love performing in acoustic environments where people enjoy music in its purest form
640 unlike other jazz events this one is free plus they get to enjoy food and drink in a very relaxed atmosphere
641 there are 11 sunrise condos near the venue so its within walking distance for residents this explains the good response to the event and why it keeps getting better every year
642 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
643 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
644 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
645 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
646 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
647 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security

661 while it is in some respects a sad day for me i do look forward to the next chapter in my life spending more time with wife wendy my daughters and grandchildren
662 it has been an absolute privilege and honour to serve the wonderful people of this electorate for the past 15 years a responsibility i have never taken for granted
663 there are some real challenges ahead and it will be important that the people of lyne elect someone who has absolute commitment to the job and the capacity to actually deliver the services and government funding this area needs
664 you need the backing of a strong team and i have been privileged to have had that from my federal and state colleagues
665 its also critical to have the absolute support of your family so you can put the people you represent first
666 parliamentary sittings committee work and other duties of a federal member take you away from home for a good six months of the year
667 fortunately i have had the full support of wendy and my daughters who have been prepared to sacrifice family time with me so i could do that job effectively
668 at a recent council meeting representatives from surf lifesaving services australia said 51 people were rescued at the beaches over the past few years
669 how can a council ignore the principles of competitive neutrality and use general revenue to prop up a poorly performing business unit at the expense of an essential service that saves lives
670 tourism in this area will be seriously affected by councils decision to not protect their beaches just so it can maintain market share in an area where there is a viable non council alternative
671 ratepayers should not be punished for councils mismanagement of funds and resources
672 how many more reports findings and data have to be released saying the same thing before governments sit up and listen
673 councils are at financial breaking point and are struggling to provide the services and facilities their ratepayers need and deserve
674 rate pegging is a big problem because it hampers councils ability to set rates according to local needs but a low share of federal taxation revenue skyrocketing election costs and population pressures are also contributing
675 cost shifting is a continuing issue and the state governments recent planning laws are a classic example they mean a bunch of new panels and systems which councils dont support but will have to fund
676 if the government supports iparts recommendation to remove councils exemption from payroll tax and increase our contribution to state run fire services ratepayers will again lose
677 while the infrastructure data used by fiscal star needs to be improved to make the findings for each council more reliable and less alarmist the general conclusions are the same as the independent report into the financial sustainability of local government released in 2006 and various other surveys and findings since
678 the removal of rate pegging and a greater share of federal taxation are part solutions but the state government also needs to stop cost shifting and start supporting local councils and their ratepayers
679 councils are committed to their communities and are good at providing for them but are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs
680 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point

703 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring

705 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this

710 he george w bush wishes him well and will continue to work closely with him olmert while he remains prime minister
711 its true that olmert was enthusiastic about the peace process and he spoke about this process with great attention but it has not achieved any progress or breakthrough
712 the palestinian authority deals with the prime minister of israel regardless if he is olmert or somebody else
713 i continue to believe wholeheartedly that reaching peace ending terrorism strengthening security and establishing a different relationship with our neighbors are the most vital goals for the future of the state of israel
714 proud to be a citizen of a country in which a prime minister can be investigated like any other citizen
715 was forced to defend himself from ceaseless attacks by the self appointed soldiers of justice who sought to oust him from his position

724 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
725 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
726 did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois

728 weve been doing this for 20 years and have data that goes as far back as 1865 and its really abnormal
729 australia is headed for a once in 100 year real estate slump
730 i have never seen the convergence of so many negatives
731 by every metric i can think of australian houses are too expensive
732 new york state and the united states are experiencing a downturn in the economy that is worse than the energy crisis of 30 years ago that is greater than the economic recession of 40 years ago and may yet be as challenging to the american population as even the great depression this crisis is as undeniable as it is dangerous
733 we have to be smarter about money for too long governments have done less with more and paid more for less
734 we are going to have to cut spending the time has come for america to cut up its credit cards
735 there is no quick fix there is no silver bullet there is no painless way in which we can escape these consequences
736 the federal government is going to have to put more into the states that support it in the next few years before we have what will be a national crisis of bankruptcy and perhaps further fiscal insolvency

740 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
741 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
742 smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
743 however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices
744 both the vcfl and the lexton plains football league are delighted with the way the ararat eagles have treated this matter ward said
745 they have been very proactive and have worked hard recently on improving their image both within the league and within the ararat community
746 the stance of the league and the ararat eagles is that we wont tolerate inappropriate behaviour
747 i know what the people of ararat like and they know when im not cooking mrs hevey said
748 ive always wanted to have a go at running my own restaurant mrs hevey said
749 i cant wait its going to be a different sort of experience miss hevey said
750 everyone asked me to stay because they missed my cooking mrs hevey said
751 we are really excited its been a lot of hard work but now its all coming together she said
752 the afl was reluctant to give tom wills the recognition he deserves we started working towards this in november last year but now theyve afl come on board and its really good they have got kevin sheedy to come up here
753 sheedy is such a great ambassador for afl you couldnt get a better person
754 its a wonderful opportunity for all our under 16s reserves and seniors theyre not going to get an opportunity like this again mrs brain said
755 it will be really important for the moyston community there have been signs in the town referring to it being the birthplace of afl since the 1970s she said
756 this will really put a stamp on it that the signs do actually mean something afterall
757 we are going to play in the finals its the celebrations almost overshadowed by that alone mrs brain said
758 this is a great opportunity for moyston to show the rest of australia that little towns really do have a big heart ms kirkpatrick said
759 moyston has a proud footballing history and we really encourage the community to get down to the footy oval to show its support for the game and for the town

766 its got length its got rough its got tough greens so you need to be on your game
767 see what youre dealing with now is karma ha you really are a greek tragedy
768 the comments on your site really made me feel hopeful and better about the whole situation since i have no experience with cardio stuff
769 oh because at st davids we dont do heart transplants
770 well we need to do a heart biopsy and the ones who do that are the doctors who handle transplants
771 but im also not just going in there until you know the risks so in a transplant patient to do a biopsy of the heart to see if theyre rejecting it isnt a big deal but with you phil the risk is five fold and its by no means a simple little procedure if you want i can go in there and biopsy but when i do that the heart can tear and make a hole which well isnt good see the heart is like steak you know how a flank steak can just tear well essentially im going in there and taking bites out of your heart im telling you all of this because you need to know the risks and some people would rather not have the biopsies theyd rather not know whats going on
772 because given all you have atrial fibrillation complete stage three heart block and most concerning in all of this a very low velocity and very erratic heart trace something is wrong and very abnormal something bigger is probably going on now usually you have symptoms you come in complaining about your gallbladder or something and we narrow it down to the heart but everything about this situation is well something weve never seen before
773 if we do the biopsy hopefully well be able to rule out certain heart diseases namely infiltrated cardiomyopothy amyloidosis myocarditis but other things as well the bad thing with doing a biopsy aside from the risks involved with tearing is that sometimes a biopsy yields nothing
774 is you might not like the results i might tell you that you have something that cannot be cured that even a transplant wont fix and some people dont want that kind of knowledge so they elect not to do the biopsy ill let you two talk it over

777 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics did we steal a play from an old media pr conceit lists yes do we want more traffic of course but today there are almost innumerable ways for ones voice to be heard the goal of the mostpublic index is to measure on a completely transparent metric driven basis who is most effectively broadcasting their own personal brand online and who are the emerging players

795 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
796 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
797 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
798 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
799 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
800 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
801 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
802 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
803 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
804 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
805 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
806 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed

818 o tribunal constitucional pronunciou se pela inconstitucionalidade de v rias normas do decreto que aprovou a revis o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores nesse sentido irei devolver nos termos da lei o respectivo diploma assembleia da rep blica
819 devo no entanto comunicar aos portugueses que outras normas me suscitam s rias reservas de natureza pol tico institucional
820 trata se acima de tudo da norma relativa dissolu o da assembleia legislativa dos a ores que inovando em rela o ao estatuto em vigor e em rela o ao estatuto da madeira restringe o exerc cio das compet ncias pol ticas do presidente da rep blica pondo em causa o equil brio e a configura o de poderes do nosso sistema pol tico previsto na constitui o
821 em devido tempo alertei v rios dirigentes pol ticos para esta quest o
822 nos termos da constitui o a assembleia legislativa regional pode ser dissolvida pelo presidente da rep blica ouvidos o conselho de estado e os partidos nela representados
823 o diploma em causa pretende agora consagrar o dever adicional de o presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa os seus grupos e representa es parlamentares e o presidente do governo regional
824 quer isto dizer que o presidente da rep blica estaria sujeito a mais deveres de audi o e consulta no que toca dissolu o da assembleia regional dos a ores do que os previstos para a dissolu o da assembleia da rep blica
825 no caso da assembleia da rep blica o presidente da rep blica nos termos constitucionais n o precisa de ouvir a assembleia da rep blica nem o primeiro ministro mas no caso da assembleia legislativa dos a ores teria de ouvir a pr pria assembleia legislativa regional e o presidente do governo regional
826 a audi o aut noma do presidente do governo regional tanto mais incompreens vel quanto ele tem assento no conselho de estado e a ouvido pelo presidente da rep blica
827 o mesmo se pode dizer relativamente audi o aut noma da assembleia legislativa e dos seus grupos parlamentares porquanto nos termos constitucionais o presidente da rep blica j ouve os partidos nela representados
828 entendo que perigoso para o princ pio fundamental da separa o e interdepend ncia de poderes que alicer a o nosso sistema pol tico aceitar o precedente que poderia ser invocado no futuro de por lei ordin ria como o caso do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores se vir a impor obriga es e limites s compet ncias dos rg os de soberania que n o sejam expressamente autorizados pela constitui o da rep blica
829 semelhante pr tica desfiguraria o equil brio de poderes tal como este tem existido e afectaria o normal funcionamento das institui es da rep blica por isso que considero ser meu dever alertar os portugueses
830 devo igualmente chamar a aten o para um outro ponto conexo com o anterior
831 no passado dia 10 deste m s foi publicada uma lei da assembleia da rep blica sobre o estatuto do representante da rep blica nas regi es aut nomas no qual se estipula tal como consta da constitui o que o representante nomeado e exonerado pelo presidente da rep blica ouvido o governo
832 sobre exactamente o mesmo assunto o decreto da assembleia da rep blica que aprova o novo estatuto dos a ores acrescenta a obriga o do presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa da regi o
833 n o se questiona a audi o da assembleia regional na pessoa do seu presidente foi isso que fiz no in cio do meu mandato quando nomeei os representantes da rep blica para os a ores e para a madeira pr tica que ali s segui quando desempenhei as fun es de primeiro ministro e que tenciono manter como presidente da rep blica
834 mas se aquela audi o tiver por objecto o pr prio rg o colegial podem emergir consequ ncias negativas no processo de designa o do representante
835 por um lado porque pode colocar o presidente da rep blica no centro de um debate parlamentar regional e por outro porque pode fragilizar politicamente o representante da rep blica e dificultar a escolha de uma personalidade com perfil adequado
836 considero ainda que merecem repondera o outras normas inovadoras constantes do estatuto
837 por um lado o procedimento de audi o qualificada que pelas vincula es que cria para os rg os de soberania envolvidos restringe os seus poderes de decis o ultrapassando em muito a regulamenta o do simples direito de audi o previsto na constitui o
838 por outro lado a limita o dos poderes de revis o do estatuto pela assembleia da rep blica s normas que tenham sido objecto da iniciativa da assembleia legislativa a oriana implica restri es excessivas ao poder de iniciativa legislativa superveniente dos deputados do parlamento nacional
839 face incerteza que caracteriza os tempos modernos a possibilidade de petrifica o de normas jur dicas constantes do estatuto ao ponto de eternizar a sua vig ncia deve ser examinada com todo o cuidado
840 a altera o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores visa concretizar o modelo avan ado de autonomia resultante da revis o constitucional de 2004 mas indispens vel que essa altera o se harmonize com a separa o de poderes e as compet ncias dos rg os de soberania consagrados na constitui o da rep blica portuguesa
841 temperatures by and large over the summer have been near normal with no real extremes
842 we had kind of a cool may and a warmer april but nothing unusual
843 this year the jet stream has been right over us which is why weve been so stormy
844 because weve been so stormy its kind of kept us out of the heat the forecast for the next two days takes us up into the lower 90s when we get into that warmer weather thats an indication that stream has moved to the north
845 first you can get dehydration which can turn into heat exhaustion and eventually can be heat stroke
846 its a spectrum you go from one to the other
847 you want to drink at a comfortable pace where you dont get sick from drinking and you stay hydrated
848 the mantra this year is celebrate remember and fight back
849 celebrating our survivors remembering those we lost and fighting back against cancer
850 it doesnt matter what race you are what sex you are we all come together to fight cancer we welcome anybody and everybody to come out its a cant miss opportunity
851 i heard i lost so much blood that there was hardly any blood left to bleed
852 it is one of australias iconic brands but the bottom line is that the rsl brand is slowly disappearing and sub branches are losing their homes as they either close or amalgamate
853 a club in bourke has just gone into administration and the areas veteran welfare activities come under threat as you start to lose those threads in those towns
854 in a country town if you lose an rsl club the anzac day activities that occur there disappear in a time where we have seen a resurgence in those activities
855 the way he killed her and chopped up the body shows a terrible cruelty he killed her chopped her up and threw part of her body into the river
856 he started to beat her and she went to live with a friend
857 he is unemployed but he lives well hes always going to parties in the city
858 we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania brazil the body was discovered early on july 29
859 next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance to the family brazilian police are investigating
860 there are around 41 fewer first time buyers now than at the same time last year
861 the nationwide data indicate that there is ongoing major downward pressure on house prices from extremely weak market activity stretched buyer affordability and tight lending conditions it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south given that the bank of england reported extremely low mortgage approvals for house purchases in june while latest survey evidence shows that house sales are depressed buyer interest is weak it is taking longer to sell a house and sellers are achieving a falling percentage of their asking price
862 its clear that gordon brown failed to prepare our economy during his 10 years at the treasury and now hard pressed families are paying the price
863 this correction in house prices is happening because the government allowed the market to get hopelessly out of control
864 interest rate cuts are clearly not on the agenda in the near term
865 which would clearly be very bad news for the housing market
866 affected by this regrettable situation in particular to those who had received an inaccurate diagnosis
867 i can confirm that 17 patients were initially informed incorrectly that they did not have a malignancy such as cancer however we must emphasise that a number of these patients would have undergone precautionary treatment anyway or been subject to ongoing clinical review
868 furthermore we can now give absolute assurance that all patients are now following the correct course of treatment
869 our highest priority throughout has been the care and wellbeing of our patients and we have acted as quickly as possible to make sure that the review was carried out thoroughly and effectively
870 the patients involved have generally appreciated the efforts we have made to investigate this situation and to recheck individually their samples diagnosis and treatment and i thank them all for their patience and understanding no patients that we have been able to identify have died as a result of a misdiagnosis
871 where necessary those patients have had their treatment amended we would like to reassure patients that individual details will not be made public
872 clearly everyone affected will be concerned that not having received the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time has adversely affected their chances of recovery or worsened their prognosis
873 this is not the first time that a large group of people have been harmed by what appears to have involved the poor judgment of a histopathologist which is why a careful multi disciplinary approach to diagnosis and assessment of treatment modality is so important
874 an episode such as this demands an independent inquiry into what went wrong so that lessons can be learned across the health service
875 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
876 unless we reach some kind of resolution in the next 48 hours this whole thing will have been an expensive waste of time
877 the devil may be in the detail of the implementation report to be published in the autumn
878 lack of commitment from nhs management at all levels has impeded progress in implementing informatics support for patient care
879 if we were to criticise it would be that there is little recognition or emphasis on building from experience as a profession we have extensive experience on the issues and problems of health informatics we hope this will be used too much emphasis on central development sometimes ignores this fund of knowledge
880 ticket sales have been brisk and our inventory is dwindling by the day
881 we are ahead of last years sales at this point and are on pace to rival our record for season ticket sales 24 300 in 2001 weve already sold our third most in a year
882 there are matters which have arisen which would have caused anybody very considerable concern
883 the evidence has demonstrated that the practice of beasting which clearly falls outside appropriate military discipline was going on in these barracks openly and must have been known to senior officers
884 many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustnt be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge
885 the conclusion of the trial allows the royal military police now to conduct a full investigation into his death
886 this will examine whether there were any breaches of military law a decision can then be made on further action i am unable to comment until this investigation concludes
887 left no stone unturned in their effort to establish the full circumstances
888 we are devastated with the outcome of the verdicts today we have come this far we owe it to gavin that nobody elses child goes through what happened to gavin
889 we have all been hung out to dry its been really stressful i feel great sympathy for gavin williams family beasting is happening all the time the army should address it
890 this government has reached an end national responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections
891 the most failed and corrupt leader in the history of israel
892 british gas customers still reeling from 35 price hikes might have expected centrica to be losing money
893 they will be staggered at the rude health of centricas half year profit
894 customers will be outraged to learn that while they ponder how to make ends meet centricas shareholders are enjoying an increase in their dividends
895 across the uk fuel poverty could affect 6 million households by the end of the year
896 ministers may well be on holiday now but they need to stop their sunbathing and plan ahead to protect vulnerable households from the cold this winter
897 this combination of massive profits and eye watering price rises proves that the privatised provision of basic utilities has failed the public
898 they should be taken back into some form of ownership by the community
899 these latest vast profits now put the case for a windfall tax on big oil companies beyond argument
900 the government should grasp the nettle and do what it did in 1997 by taxing grotesque profits and put the proceeds into helping the millions of people struggling with their fuel bills
901 i dont see why it will help consumers in the long term
902 after external investment in frostfrench in 2006 in which they had to relinquish their overall control and influence in the company a new management team was installed sadie and jemima have been unhappy with the strategic direction and many of the day to day decisions
903 has ensured the future of the brand and has preserved jobs
904 i dont want to go into too much detail but it will be a completely new approach
905 sadie and jemima relish the opportunity to be fully hands on again both designers are working on their next collection
906 the club has sought clarification from the fa as to why this decision has been reached now given the incident occurred nearly 15 months ago
907 as we said yesterday we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives
908 what has mr miliband ever achieved apart from furthering his own career if david miliband was placed back on the backbenches then i think he would become the nonentity that he was before his accelerated promotion
909 duplicitous it says one thing but it means another which is pretty contemptible politics
910 i think the worst thing at the moment would be if we all went mute i think its right that we say that sure weve taken some hits but actually weve got ideas about the future of the country we do want to engage with people were not all standing at the side of the ring saying go on gordon you do it on your own were saying were there with you were going to get in there and make sure that this really is a team effort because we have to take collective responsibility for this
911 the analysis of the teeth suggests the men grew up in a warm climate probably somewhere in southern europe professor montgomery said
912 its also known that at this time henry viii was short of skilled soldiers and sailors and was trying to recruit mercenaries from the continent
913 a key driver of marketing budgets is corporate profitability and when corporate profits are hurting marketing gets hit
914 weve never subscribed to is it structural or is it cyclical
915 we believe obviously that media is fragmenting but if you can build your portfolio by launch and acquisition and the right combination of products to meet the needs of readers and advertisers theres no reason you cant grow very healthily in the future
916 we have to plan and manage our business on the assumption that this difficult environment will continue for some time to come advertising is inextricably linked to the economy and the economy is still deteriorating
917 i could buy market share tomorrow pick a number and i could buy it but it would mean cutting the price like our competitors to inflate sales volume and spending cash on dvds and cds just to make a headline sales increase from which shareholders will not get a return
918 we look back on the multiples we sold the businesses on and they look like damn good multiples now dont they
919 we have no plans to do that and no issues with our balance sheet
920 i want to continue to do this job as long as my board and my shareholders want me to
921 when he hit top gear at the two furlong marker he picked up the leader in a matter of strides he is better than any stayer ive ridden in that he just has that bit of class he equalled sagaros record of three gold cup wins at ascot and i know theres lots of people who come to the races just to see him
922 shes not the easiest filly in the world but shes run here three times and won twice and finished second in this last year so she obviously likes the place
923 i dont really know where shell go next id expect her to go to stud next year as shes done her stuff
924 she will go next to the park hill stakes at doncaster and i think she could be a 10lb better filly next year
925 what is quite clear is that lucas is determined to stop mr ainsworth by whatever legitimate legal means are open to it including the threat of a 10m judgment hanging over him
926 makes it clear that lucasfilm and george lucas are the rightful owners of the copyrights related to star wars we do not intend to use this ruling to discourage our fans from expressing their imagination creativity and passion for star wars through the costumes and props they make for their personal use rather we see the courts decision as reaffirming that those who seek to illegally profit from star wars will be brought to task
927 youve been out there all day running in and then the decision gets turned down you can chunter as much as you want at the umpire but youve got to get on with it it was an aimless rant i went in to see aleem afterwards and apologised i shook his hand and were friends again
928 we needed to get wickets to get into the game it was nice to take some ive worked hard to get to this point after everything ive done with my physio dave roberts over the past six months after my ankle operation im pleased
929 when youre coming up against some of the best players in the world and kallis is right up there it brings the best out of you
930 its nice to get 200 but id sooner have done it 15 or 20 tests ago
931 i would withdraw from public life and make certain gestures and in return the us would fulfil its commitments
932 my commitment was to withdraw and not to endanger in any way the implementation of the dayton agreement to withdraw even from literary life
933 i believe that its very important for my fate for my legal position
934 i have to show why im appearing before this court only now not in 1996 or 97 or 98 when i had the intention of appearing here my life was in danger of being liquidated because i had made a deal
935 if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence in this court i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach me here
936 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
937 self representation is indeed a right but if mr karadzic uses that to obstruct trial proceedings as mr milosevic did then the court should step in and take action
938 speed matters in a showdown between gunslingers but it has no place in court
939 scenes from hell written on the darkest pages of history
940 i have not found one bone of my children yet and there he is alive
941 today i feel there is a bit of justice in this otherwise really pitiful world
942 if the dating remains as inconclusive a homicide inquiry is unlikely
943 i believe that it is very likely that children died here what i cannot say is how they died
944 we are highly suspicious of the circumstances of how we found bones and the teeth burnt and buried
945 the abuse aspect was quite appalling enough without children dying
946 my estimate is that at least 500 million of those medicines are wasted
947 our pharmacists have reported many instances when patients have been confused by their medicines
948 we know that many patients choose not to complete their course of medication
949 but this study reveals a different type of problem patients who for whatever reason take their medicines incorrectly the biggest issues are among those who are taking more than one prescription medicine at a time the problem seems to be more acute among older patients
950 hes a dog he told me i was his girlfriend and then my friend went to the opening of surf lodge and was introduced to another woman he called his girlfriend there are girls all over with him

956 you have got to be kidding you know i cannot answer that question first of all i am a lawyer and would have to protect any information about whom i am acting for or even if i am acting for a particular person but more importantly i believe in freedom of the blog it is a variation of freedom of the press and i have no intention of revealing any sources or giving out any confidential information
957 thanks to you i have just won a big bottle of canadian club i bet with my colleagues that you would say that our bet was a bottle of rye whiskey as you know one is either a rye man or a scotch man as for me unless i put in some mix to kill the taste i would never drink scotch
958 please blogmeister we think you are the only one who can help us we have read your blogs you are the only one in windsor and essex county who seems to understands the windsor star and its main columnist gord henderson in particular
959 you did not need to go to all of this drama for that you could have just waited a few hours until my next blog came out
960 we know that you spent five years working on one of the worlds largest private white collar bankruptcies two years of it in london england we know that you managed a hundred or more professionals around the world working under you and that you helped coordinate a worldwide seizure by various police forces of documents on the same day and at the same time it was unprecedented hendersons fixation on scotch whiskey and malt whiskey specifically intrigued us because one of the claims to fame of the hotel that you stayed at in london was its world famous scotch malt bar we assumed that he was signalling you since he would have thought that only you two knew that

970 there are good reasons why the original native american tribes settled in this area why the explorers came why people settled here and built their cities and why the area continues to provide a very high quality of life and economic well being for millions of people
971 the thing thats a bit more challenging is the portion near caron and the old railway cut because that will require a lot of excavation to bring the river water in
972 also included in brooks concept is conversion of a three block stretch of either pitt street or chatham street into a new east west 20 foot deep canal filled with municipal not detroit river water that eventually travels north back toward the riverfront on property just west of the art gallery
973 calvin brook the award winning toronto urban designer who conceived this plan
974 i tend to assume he has his ducks already lined up
975 mpp sandra pupatello l windsor west who spoke to francis about the plan a few months ago

1010 you are loved you are cared for you are beautiful never for this
1011 i havent made up my mind whether to go through with it
1012 this is the perfect storm for our business and we see no signs of it blowing over
1013 overall results were weaker than expected due to one time charges and asset sale writeoffs in both rescap and gmac auto
1014 we expect weak results in both businesses to continue at least through the end 2008
1015 we spend the money and the tons dont come out
1016 weve seen that come on track in the latter part of the second quarter but not enough to affect it
1017 the lawn and garden category has proven to be resilient in a difficult economic environment and we are pleased with the results we announced today
1018 prospex achieved significant production growth during the second quarter as a result of a successful winter drilling program
1019 our summer drilling program is now underway in west central alberta with drilling operations in the deep basin scheduled to start within the next week
1020 its a category we believe in and we see an opportunity to grow it even faster as a pure play leader in its business
1021 we think its a business that has great potential and a great future
1022 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
1023 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
1024 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
1025 our results reflect continuing input cost pressures that have more than offset the improvements we have been able to achieve in realized selling prices for our products
1026 we have continued to focus on improving our operations which has resulted in improved operating efficiency reduced consumption of high cost fuel sources higher throughput in our pulp and paper operations and reduced fixed costs
1027 the significant increase in second quarter earnings and cash flow demonstrates transcanadas ability to deliver strong financial performance from its growing portfolio of high quality assets
1028 this is the perfect storm for our business and we see no signs of it blowing over
1029 overall results were weaker than expected due to one time charges and asset sale writeoffs in both rescap and gmac auto
1030 we expect weak results in both businesses to continue at least through the end 2008
1031 some of these measures require additional work but the agency will come back to these and others each year
1032 we are working hard to improve quality and efficiency but simply not paying for complications or conditions that while regrettable are not entirely preventable is not the way to do it

1036 the reverence the raptness the depth of concentration in his bravely deep poems
1037 the dazzling conquest of mexico gave a new impulse to the ardor of discovery
1038 the hardest part in the repatriation process is getting the museum to agree with you and cranbrook has already done that
1039 we feel it is the right thing to do we dont need the law to tell us that
1040 we are a museum and institute which feels very strongly about cultural rights heritage and history of native americans on a global scale we view remains as people not research objects
1041 its impossible to ascertain who these remains belong to but they have been determined to be native american they are from michigan and based on those facts alone we believe they are affiliated with anishnaabek
1042 it could be from all of the bands or one of them we believe our best line of evidence is we were here a substantial amount of time before european contact
1043 i feel really confident the review board will give us the recommendation and that this will be a success
1044 once the case is in our favor its a formality where the remains are buried
1045 i totally see why people follow convention people dont want other people to be different and they dont want them to be happy when theyre different because then the implication is that they could live differently too a lot of people just cant face that
1046 in germany they first came for the gypsies and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a gypsy then they came for the bolsheviks and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a bolshevik then they came for the jews and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a jew then they came for the trade unionists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a trade unionist then they came for the catholics i didnt speak up then because i was a protestant then they came for me and there was no one left to speak up
1047 it promises to be the best stage of the race
1048 i think its the best thing to happen to santa cruz
1049 i dont think people really know how monumental this is in terms of exposure especially internationally
1050 certainly its nice to go where people appreciate cycling that would clearly be santa cruz and davis those two cities we heard all along in those two cycling is as popular as anywhere in the state which transfers to anywhere in the country really
1051 we are really especially given our budget going to be focused on finding support
1052 the great thing was it brought a lot of people into the downtown core restaurants coffee shots and stores all did really well
1053 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
1054 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
1055 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
1056 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
1057 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
1058 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
1059 ive an idea if we block off the sitting room end of the chimney i could run a tube from the exhaust of the car down from the chimney pot carbon monoxide the end would be quick and he wouldnt suffer any more

1066 as these foreign powers grow in wealth and influence the danger is that a country which is as open as britain to foreign investment eventually just becomes the kind of plaything for the political whims of foreign powers
1067 dubai buying liverpool may not be much of an issue but when it comes to a utility or a major bank it could well be
1068 i think theyve proven themselves to be a stabilizing influence in the world
1069 theyve put to work billions of dollars to stabilise the banking system in europe and specifically in the us
1070 theyre frequently run either directly by government officials or by government cronies so although we have not yet seen any cases of outright abuse its quite possible that well get them and in fact i think it is extremely likely over the next five to 10 years
1071 if we come to the crunch about issues like taiwan tibet things where we are strategic competitors in a way and we dont agree does that mean we are going to be very muted in our response that were going to be obliged to react less strongly than we did before
1072 they are going to be very big players and that shouldnt worry us
1073 would we prefer the countries of the gulf to be earning all that money and burying it in the sand would we prefer the chinese to be simply hoarding the money or bailing out our banks and investing it in potentially profitable investment opportunities in the uk or germany or france or america
1074 by 2012 sovereign wealth funds will have about 7 trillion to invest worldwide

1076 as a christian as a biblical christian i have real concerns about this because i dont find this in the scriptures
1077 you see its true the world has all kinds of problems but hes working on the symptoms and avoiding the root cause which is the sin nature of humanity so how can you work with all kinds of people who are called people of faith but its not biblical faith
1078 these are the stories that we live for at nbc news across all our platforms we are offering an unprecedented amount of convention coverage and we stand ready to field an incredibly talented and deeply knowledgeable team

1082 lo que descubrimos es que esta enfermedad es un defecto de la capacidad defensiva m s primaria que tiene el ser humano para responder a una infecci n
1083 de estos tres ni os dos han fallecido lo cual indica la gravedad de esta enfermedad
1084 y de los nueve casos que se conocen agrega el m dico cinco fueron descubiertos en espa a
1085 para que el organismo pueda llegar a una respuesta inflamatoria explica el doctor rodrigo alguien le tiene que avisar al sistema inmune para que lance su defensa
1086 pero en estos ni os falla una de las mol culas encargadas de avisar al sistema inmune de la presencia de una infecci n y de que debe responder a ella
1087 lo que nos sorprendi encontrar fue que a diferencia de los ni os los animales resultaron susceptibles a infecciones de todo tipo de virus bacterias etc
1088 pero el ser humano al parecer s lo es susceptible al estafilococo y neumococo cuando falla este gen as que ahora estamos tratando de descubrir porqu ocurre esto
1089 por eso ahora que conocemos esta enfermedad esperamos que m s m dicos alrededor del mundo puedan reconocer esta alteraci n cuando algo falle en el organismo y no se logre identificar qu es

1100 we have to remember that the model is not the disease
1101 if you want to maintain a constant level of inhibition with more neurosteroids you need fewer receptors
1102 after pregnancy when hormone levels drop off you need more receptors to maintain that level if you cannot maintain that level after pregnancy thats when the disorders manifest
1103 our thinking is that postpartum depression and maybe premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder may be due to impaired trafficking of these gaba receptors to the neural membrane
1104 we dont know if this is the same mechanism in humans but i think all indications are there
1105 the women that are affected by the disorder the hormone levels are not changed they are not different than in unaffected women so we are confident that it must be the receptor trafficking mechanism that is affected because the changes in hormone levels are pretty normal

1121 there have been at least three marine biodiversity hotspots during the past 50 million years
1122 they have moved across almost half the globe with their timing and locations coinciding with major tectonic events
1123 its clearly something we cant do anything about but the hotspot is more vulnerable than it used to be 6 or 10 million years ago
1124 its more vulnerable so you have to be extra cautious about what you do its closer to the edge than it was
1125 everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
1126 china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
1127 developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
1128 telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
1129 in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
1130 that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
1131 china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
1132 the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader
1133 if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market
1134 if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
1135 i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night
1136 opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1137 on the oxygen side it doesnt work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the oxygen out

1142 this is not expected to have a negative impact on kyoto implementation

1188 a person who poses no danger to the community will be able to remain in the community while their visa status is resolved
1189 labor rejects the notion that dehumanising and punishing unauthorised arrivals with long term detention is an effective or civilised response
1190 desperate people are not deterred by the threat of harsh detention they are often fleeing much worse circumstances
1191 so many people who have already come through that asylum seeker process having spent time in places like woomera and baxter have been damaged for life and they have huge problems in terms of integrating in the community and becoming citizens as a result of the experiences they have endured
1192 this government must ensure that no change of heart or government can turn this policy around

1282 id be buying lobsters anyway but not as many if the prices werent this low
1283 the one bit of information that someone was able to tuck into their pocket and go back to their own pc at home or go to the library or whatever they did and utilize that that made them remember they talked to one of our firefighters
1284 we put the butts in the seat but now we have to hope that they passed and that everything worked
1285 i did have some calls from some suburbs of chicago
1286 i talked several times with evanston fire department sent them our information on what were doing with facebook and myspace and so on and then shared with them how things work
1287 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
1288 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season
1289 while jamar will always be a part of the illinois basketball family i have made the decision that he can no longer be a part of our team our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation
1290 he wants to give both the packers and brett an appropriate amount of time to make decisions including decisions impacting the teams roster and salary cap when brett is reinstated by the commissioner we will announce it
1291 i really dont have any thoughts as far as mark murphy going to mississippi
1292 thats something youre going to have to ask mark about im not involved in the specifics of it i really have no information for you
1293 the system level aspect of cloud computing is thus far inadequately understood so thats where we see our niche
1294 oh man that was the heaviest slam weve ever seen
1295 i didnt believe much of your testimony and i didnt believe much of your testimony because of your claimed lack of memory
1296 you hear over and over against that all government officials are corrupt
1297 michelle obama connects to the modern woman she has a real woman look to her but is even bigger and better
1298 she has a sleek style thats not overdone shes beautifully dressed without too much fuss she puts on the dress and goes and its always a good dress
1299 the alaia shows shes a little bit of a fashion insider but its more of her intelligence and independence that shows through
1300 we consider ourselves the electoral college that oversees the popular vote
1301 you have a sense of her as a physical person on the move and on the go not a paper doll cutout
1302 i am excited to be joining the chicago fire for many reasons one of the most important of those is chicago is my hometown
1303 his tremendous skill and dedication to the sport are an inspiration to us all were thrilled we are able to bring him back to chicago and mls and i am confident he will have an important impact on the team
1304 gay lesbian bisexual and transgender individuals enjoy an atmosphere of inclusion and respect
1305 for a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
1306 these rule violations were established following the deliberate storage of samples by the iaaf and reanalysis using comparative dna techniques and were the result of a specific investigation which was instigated and carried out by the iaaf for more than a year

1312 hes been on the lam for four years and we were initially told he fled to mexico

1315 si bien la familia no guarda un parentesco directo de sangre si
1316 dijo c rdenas quien record que familiares de las v ctimas y varias de ellas vivieron muchos a os en un rancho de su familia

1318 did not accomplish their duty correctly and they tried to influence the votes
1319 very concerned by this loss of the right to vote
1320 brings in a loss of confidence by the public in the election process
1321 i dont know how the mayor can come in with less than 30 days experience as a public official and start getting rid of employees
1322 it would just be my assumption that she feels it involves staff it was clear she meant shults but i think it involved staff too
1323 think about the words users would type to find your pages and make sure that your site actually includes those words within it
1324 i now realise that art for arts sake was actually a cry for help from oscar wilde and his friends against the reality which is art for moneys sake
1325 it may be a long time before we see prices as good as these again but it may just be that we are at the start of a boom which could last as long as the one in the 19th century mainly 32 years between 1863 and 1895
1326 photography i think as far as other media are concerned is still undervalued in general primarily because it can only be as old as the invention of the camera
1327 in the early 1990s records were being set at 10 000 to 15 000 now records are being set at 2 5m or 3m for a photograph
1328 our average loan size is 5m so we arent going to have thousands of clients
1329 we deal with everybody but we dont make loans below 250 000 simply because were just not geared to that level of business
1330 that being said we would have to have a minimum value of 500 000 of collateral that we were lending on
1331 that still leaves plenty of collectors out there but we dont tend to do the smaller entry level type works
1332 no collector buys in a void nothing happens in the way of collecting without information information is at the core of it
1333 you cant be a collector by just looking around and picking things
1334 the last thing you want to do is to get somebody to buy something through your own passion and your own directive that theyre not engaged with because the process ends at that moment because then it just becomes get me a damien hirst get me a warhol and that isnt collecting
1335 in 20 years time i believe that the most expensive prices surfacing on the art market will be coming out of china and russia and india probably for artists none of us has heard of in the west and possibly for pictures that have not yet been painted
1336 is a one day event held twice a year in washington dc if youre an actor think of it as a mass audition youll be able to perform a monologue in front of 20 or more production companies looking to produce films in the next six months if youre a filmmaker think of stonehenge as a mass casting tool showing you over 100 actors whom you might call back to read for a specific part
1337 microsoft continues to state that vba will be included in office for many many more versions
1338 microsoft visual basic 6 4 version 1001 vba retail 6 5 1001 form3 12 0 3417 just as it does in excel 2000 score 1 for abandonware there
1339 the state was stepping in to replace the punitive poor law there had been before
1340 it did provide for more people but it didnt provide enough to live on and it was a very stringent means test
1341 for the first time many people were living beyond the point when they were physically capable of working
1342 it was the very first universal cash benefit without the stigma of the poor law
1343 despite the years of argument about national insurance and the importance of contributions it had no contribution condition
1344 that in turn meant that help could reach pensioners straight away
1345 it will have to last because a large number of people will never be able to save enough to live on in their old age
1346 under the rubric of the global war on terror the bush administration has implemented the greatest realignment of us forces since the end of the cold war
1347 the impact in africa will likely be the same as in iraq perpetual occupation instability and growing anti americanism
1348 africa is an area of increasing activity for both big oil and the us military
1349 a key mission for us forces in africa would be to insure that nigerias oilfields which in the future could account for as much as 25 of all us oil imports are secure
1350 a much quieter us military build up is underway on another continent
1351 the key aspect of which is the us militarys transformation into a global oil protection force
1352 us companies hope to expand their operations further in africa
1353 spend half the time going down the west coast to africa
1354 of course its about oil we cant really deny that
1355 of course its about oil we cant really deny that
1356 their health coverage is terminated and with little or no family support many of them end up homeless unemployed or in jail
1357 they have the same hopes and dreams as all other children in america but they have a harder path to realizing their dreams
1358 it encourages employers to look twice at these remarkable young people
1359 the services will still be here but in a different structure
1360 we have been downsizing for a while this used to be a six person office
1361 we are a charity and we depend on the people
1362 we will continue to serve the county when disasters like this hit
1363 the facts of this case to me are quite clear he knew what he was doing he intended to kill a human being and he knew that it was wrong
1364 i believe that benjamin was truly insane at the commission of the offense
1365 we wanted something more from the defense and the witnesses and we didnt get a lot
1366 he has no feelings or emotion about what he did
1367 obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn because he is now the only democratic game in town
1368 to be clear barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies
1369 obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn
1370 obama claims he will work to remove the provision granting immunity to law breakers but the fact remains that obama has gotten away with making a 180 degree turn because he is now the only democratic game in town
1371 thats the best thing that happened to me people are angry about this heres a man who has not served his district and obama is messing in our local business
1372 black folks are all too happy to go along with any treatment that obama chooses to mete out
1373 if obama were already president dissidents would have cause to shop for a safehouse or foreign getaway
1374 the treachery didnt stop with illegal government surveillance regina thomas is a black state senator in georgia running in a democratic primary against white conservative congressman john barrow obama recently endorsed barrow and recorded a radio ad in support of his campaign
1375 spook that sat by the oval office door and slyly make everything alright for them once he gets in
1376 millions of people have deliberately made their needs subservient to those of a politician who cares nothing about them the damage done by jim crow americas apartheid is never ending the desire to see a black face in a high place is an understandable one after so many decades of exclusion but it is still dangerous to accept this misguided concept
1377 theres only one thing different about barack obama when it comes to being a democratic presidential candidate hes half african american
1378 whether that will make any difference i dont know i havent heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos payday loans predatory lending asbestos lead whats keeping him from doing that is it because he wants to talk white he doesnt want to appear like jesse jackson well see all that play out in the next few months and if he gets elected afterwards
1379 i mean first of all the number one thing that a black american politician aspiring to the presidency should be is to candidly describe the plight of the poor especially in the inner cities and the rural areas and have a very detailed platform about how the poor is going to be defended by the law is going to be protected by the law and is going to be liberated by the law
1380 he wants to show that he is not a threatening another politically threatening african american politician
1381 he wants to appeal to white guilt you appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful black is powerful basically hes coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure whether its corporate or whether its simply oligarchic and they love it whites just eat it up
1382 a flip flop of epic proportions noting that obama s argument about a gop financial advantage was
1383 osborne and others suggested the endorsement was a reward for barrow throwing his superdelegate vote to obama thomas did not back obama until around the time he locked up the nomination
1384 how hard is it for you to understand that obama is not black he is half black he owes no allegiance to the black community and in the business of politics i better damn well not see any alliances not related to philosophy and principles
1385 wait until he get in and then well hold him accountable
1386 basically hes coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure whether its corporate or whether its simply oligarchic and they love it whites just eat it up
1387 republicans for obama is a grassroots organization of proud party members who all share one important trait
1388 its not the potus job to lead the black liberation movement
1389 revise history was what i said not true were the leaders of movement politicians or were they regular people
1390 werent you supporting obama it seems that you have revised your previous position
1391 you have to acknowledge that the idea that all africans should have been unified is wrong because africa is a diverse continent with many cultures and differences why would they have banded together
1392 i dont care if you are poor you can still send my campaign 5 or 10 dollars
1393 famous for streamlining ge reducing management from 29 levels to only six closing businesses and firing a significant percentage of his subordinates
1394 henry ford challenged his times and his investors by insisting on producing affordable automobiles for a mass market
1395 paris hilton has made millions of dollars by doing things that are supposed to get famous people into trouble
1396 the american public willingly made all sorts of sacrifices in their personal and family lives and it was not that way during vietnam
1397 naturally the common people dont want war but after all it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy and its always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders this is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger it works the same in every country
1398 why of course the people dont want war why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country
1399 they would never stage 9 11 the people who hold positions of power in our govt have hearts made of gold
1400 big plane hit a big building and left a big hole
1401 sometimes i change events dates and places in a certain way to protect people i cant fudge what i write but i can certainly fudge what i say

1404 6 customer support in india is the best thing that has ever happened to norton symantec they take 1 million calls a month prior to outsourcing the most calls per month was less than 100k you may hate the accent but they do great work
1405 dont even get me started on 360 and their supposed
1406 if youve got a ps3 you should get these games
1407 picking between the ps3 and 360 versions of rock band is pretty much a toss up
1408 here are the 24 titles that every playstation 3 owner should have in their collection
1409 more developers are inclined to produce more exclusive dlc gta4 in exchange for a bigger share of the profits

1416 i am among the eldest of generation x on the cusp of the boomers i tend to identify with the gen x characteristics especially survivalism pragmatism and realism
1417 its not important to get it right the rst time its important to get it right the last time
1418 painting animals and wildlife has been my passion since childhood
1419 their faces captivate me especially the inquisitive expressions and soft eyes of cows and dogs and the majestic independence of moose and big cats
1420 you measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles you had to overcome to reach your goals
1421 calibrated to cause the best kind of trouble the trouble that forces us to ask how we can make the world a better place
1422 size and strength have more to do with dna than with leadership manuals
1423 decisions are complex and there are always competing factors to look for simple explanations is the bias of the human brain but it doesnt correspond to reality nothing is ever as straightforward as it appears
1424 in the history of africa there have been only a handful of democratically elected leaders who willingly stood down from office mandela was determined to set a precedent for all who followed him not only in south africa but across the rest of the continent he knows that leaders lead as much by what they choose not to do as what they do
1425 hace falta un poco m s de conciencia por parte de los conductores quienes deben entender que por las v as donde se hace el embudo y se reduce a un s lo canal el transporte p blico no debe descargar o cargar pasajeros
1426 si se avanza en estos trabajos hay menos colapso incluso estudiamos la posibilidad de instalar una peque a f brica de cemento en la fuerzas armadas para facilitar el trabajo
1427 esperemos que el tsj empiece a rectificar lo que ha sido una violaci n de los derechos humanos
1428 para lograr tales acuerdos tuvimos que solicitar ante la instancia mayor ministerio de educaci n la aprobaci n de 40 mediante dos cr ditos adicionales todo ello en vista de que el c lculo asignado por el ente oficial a la avec seg n subvenci n fue de un total de bsf 570
1429 los cr ditos adicionales suman bsf 282 762 los cuales distribuiremos en dos partes una de ellas estar depositada dios mediante para este viernes
1430 hasta la fecha tenemos un total de 202 expedientes en el ministerio de educaci n todos ellos con 25 a os de servicio y m s
1431 la capacidad est agotada las calles son insuficientes y no se est n desarrollando rutas alternas
1432 ha crecido el transporte automotor y no hay ninguna v a nueva
1433 por hora pasan menos carros y no se aprovecha la autopista en su m xima capacidad
1434 estaban bien concebidas para sus pocas tan bien las hicieron que todav a funcionan manejan el tr fico deficientemente pero lo manejan
1435 no hay planificaci n ni inter s en hacer nuevas v as
1436 se est n haciendo unas trancas horribles la gente se demora tres y hasta cuatro horas para salir de caracas por la valle coche lo mismo pasa por parque del este y en la autopista prados del este eso y que es horrible
1437 esas nuevas v as se llenar an de carros r pidamente lo mejor es fomentar el transporte p blico y que las rutas nuevas no sean alimentadoras sino complementarias
1438 las v as nuevas van a generar m s congesti n hacen falta soluciones r pidas el problema del tr fico se puede resolver con peque os detalles pero efectivos si todos unidos pudi ramos coordinarnos ver amos mejoras a corto plazo
1439 el 35 de los conductores no deber a atravesar la capital

1441 no se puede salir de la rinconada hacia maracay sin regresar hasta fuerte tiuna dar la vuelta y tomar la autopista regional del centro lo mismo sucede para los que quieren llegar a la rinconada por esta autopista son dos enlaces viales necesarios que no se hicieron
1442 las cooperativas son un instrumento del mismo capitalismo y deber amos inclusive discutir los modelos porque ustedes sin darse cuenta pudieran esta reproduciendo el modelo que queremos desplazar

1448 i think its irresponsible of the oil companies to be making such large profits
1449 they say what they need to say to get into office unfortunately
1450 i remember in high school gas was 92 cents per gallon
1451 to look at the amount were paying for gas at the pump and see these record profits in the oil companies its not like theyre just passing on their costs to the consumer theyre really getting a lot of profit out of this
1452 weve got a group of blokes there that are very excited about whats ahead of them and looking to make the most of it
1453 to win a tri nations match it doesnt matter where it is its significant and weve got one coming up and were looking forward to it

1455 may be effective in relieving symptoms of acute bronchitis in adults and children
1456 may also be effective in alleviating symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis and the common cold in adults
1457 there is encouraging evidence from currently available data that p sidoides is effective compared to placebo for patients with acute bronchitis
1458 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
1459 i understand why the senator would like to have this matter commenced and concluded before the elections and by all indications that is possible
1460 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
1461 hey dad ran over a bike uh my gas is leaking gnight bye
1462 that is when most problems occur when people go to the newer versions youll always hear when a new one comes out its got some bugs in it still that is just because there are so many kinds of computers they couldnt possibly test everything even though they try
1463 i see that every day the only thing any warranty is going to cover is hardware related basically the manufacturer warranty will cover hardware but not software
1464 software support is a lot more time consuming than your standard tech support a lot of it is user error you almost have to try to train the person how to use the software in order to make everything work the way it is supposed to
1465 you can google your problem and end up with all kinds of resources but it is going to be mixed in with useless information and people trying to charge you stuff
1466 a lot of this really does come back to computer literacy
1467 they cut down on printing these big volumes of manuals that never were used we have a saying that probably less than 10 percent of people ever cracked their manual especially if everything is going right you dont look for it until something goes wrong
1468 lets say you have a hewlett packard computer and you call hp technical support they wont tell you they are going to charge you but however long you are on the phone if it is a half hour they end up billing it to the phone bill they find out later that that one half hour call cost them x number of dollars
1469 once things go wrong and youve exhausted your resources just like when you are sick sometimes you have to call the doctor sometimes you need somebody to help you out because its keeping you from getting your work done
1470 if mccain picked a woman it would certainly get the attention and perhaps votes of some democrats and a number of independents who supported hillary clinton
1471 shes got it all and is a remarkable leader who brings a number of good qualities to the table
1472 this fall theres going to be a lot of energy surrounding the obama campaign and we need to find ways to generate a substantial amount of energy around the mccain campaign and an effective dynamic different kind of vice presidential nominee i think would make a difference
1473 a mother of five is a genuine alaskan is a hunter is a dogsledder is very much for drilling for oil has a great reform reputation took on big oil on behalf of the people of alaska
1474 i think she would bring a level of excitement and uniqueness that people would have to stop and say boy this is kind of intriguing
1475 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
1476 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
1477 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
1478 i am pleased that our stockholders have followed the recommendation of the eds board of directors and supported the combination of eds and hp
1479 not only does the combination of these two great companies create immediate value for our stockholders it also enhances our ability to achieve our customers needs with our unwavering commitment to quality and innovation
1480 if the facts are against you argue the law if the law is against you argue the facts if both are against you attack your opponent
1481 hmm so is the trochoidal a machine is it a piece of machine or is it a piece of math
1482 breves aleta de tibur n y un nuevo acercamiento entre ferrari y alonso
1483 will begin a dialogue where people will open their hearts and their minds to the problems that face this country
1484 its not something any critical mass of constituents were clamouring for which makes the exercise even more hollow
1485 im just not convinced that a federal apology has any weight
1486 to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future
1487 if you dont follow the apology with action talk is cheap talk is less expensive than reparations
1488 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy sitting next to him repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
1489 when he was attacking him he was calm it was like he was at the beach
1490 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
1491 he went back to his seat and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us
1492 the incident was very tragic but was an isolated event
1493 bus travel has been and remains the safest mode of travel in the country
1494 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare
1495 certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
1496 it is im sorry to say that it is theres no place in this campaign for that
1497 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
1498 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1499 so far all we have heard is paris hilton and britney spears
1500 i have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
1501 hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralysed yeah i said it cos bush is mentally handicapped
1502 as barack obama has said rap lyrics too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1503 hes a tough guy to play against because hes so unpredictable
1504 i feel like ive got a good game to play against him because he obviously likes guys who give him some rhythm and i obviously try not to
1505 youre fired you were rubbish anyway you have no future your home has been demolished and ive killed your dog
1506 this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a whimper
1507 the fairest possible distribution of the necessities and comforts of daily life
1508 it was a time when churchill perceiving the dangers that lay ahead struggled to mobilise the political will and industrial energy of the british empire to meet those dangers he did so often in the face of strong opposition
1509 climate change is the gathering storm of our generation and the implications should we fail to act could be no less dire and perhaps even more so
1510 oil companies are increasingly dependent on these unconventionals as they get squeezed out of countries such as nigeria and russia we fear tar sands are just the entrance ramp to oil shale gas to liquids and other non conventionals which will just press the red button for climate change disaster
1511 this government has reached an end national responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections
1512 the most failed and corrupt leader in the history of israel
1513 the disgusting actions of this group of anti chinese lawmakers
1514 exposed evil motives to politicise the olympics and interrupt and sabotage the beijing olympics
1515 by arranging such a meeting between its leader and these people and making irresponsible remarks on chinas human rights and religious situation the us side has rudely interfered in chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to anti china hostile forces
1516 moreover gdp growth in the preceding two quarters was revised down in particular the economy is now estimated to have contracted by 0 2 in q4 of last year raising the possibility that the national bureau of economic research will eventually conclude that the recession began during the final three months of 2007

1520 what is quite clear is that lucas is determined to stop mr ainsworth by whatever legitimate legal means are open to it including the threat of a 10m judgment hanging over him
1521 makes it clear that lucasfilm and george lucas are the rightful owners of the copyrights related to star wars we do not intend to use this ruling to discourage our fans from expressing their imagination creativity and passion for star wars through the costumes and props they make for their personal use rather we see the courts decision as reaffirming that those who seek to illegally profit from star wars will be brought to task

1528 people will tell you how much star wars means to them fan culture is all sorts of things it can be geeks in costumes who havent showered for two weeks or ordinary looking people who received their love of star wars from their parents and have in turn passed it on to their children
1529 the live action movies were really centred on the skywalker family and weve never gotten to see the full breadth of the conflict
1530 we grew up with star wars we really believe in it
1531 you have to handle fans as a fellow fan and you cant talk down to them fans are smart if they smell bullshit theyre not going to jump into it

1533 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
1534 it is difficult to think of anything other than the threat of unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity of the extradition process as to require the accused to be discharged irrespective of the case against him
1535 ive been telling my agent for years that i wanted an action movie but no one saw me like that
1536 two weeks before my 40th birthday i guess id given up i mean how many action roles are there for women over 40 soon after that i got a call to say they were considering me for the part

1540 id given birth to my son the year before and i was about 40lbs overweight
1541 so many actors say you have to find something you like in each character ive never bought that i think there are people in the world who are plain mean not many but some so thats how i decided to play her without sympathy

1556 i have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
1557 hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralysed yeah i said it cos bush is mentally handicapped

1584 our technology helps businesses answer the two fundamental questions of what to protect and from whom
1585 mcafee will be better equipped to help organizations address the complexity and time involved in the deployment and management of data protection
1586 not many boys can get ready in six months it takes a lot of dedication and sacrifice

1589 freezing the country teachers incentive scheme and ushering in a system which simply targets specific schools and subjects in need will devastate schools in regional and remote areas
1590 also by targeting payments to secondary teachers women will again be the losers since 98 percent of the junior primary workforce in south australia are women compared with about 50 50 in secondary schools
1591 bureaucrats believe that being in the country doesnt make any difference however we know the country schools are having trouble attracting qualified staff
1592 what we are proposing is a scheme that helps to attract more teachers with specialist skills into our schools
1593 some schools are finding it difficult to attract teachers with skills in mathematics science technology home economics and special education
1594 we are discussing with the unions the possibility of an allowance to attract and retain teachers with these skills
1595 to suggest that only men teach these subjects is offensive to women

1597 i was not a good husband and although i had some good moments i would slip back into my selfish lifestyle believing life was all about me
1598 i had been raised in the baptist church and all my life i had known of god but never knew him until my wife and i began working through a failed marriage
1599 i remember the pain was so great that i reached out to god and really prayed
1600 god does not rub it in he rubs it out
1601 no one will speak in favor not all of the ratepayers are here
1602 all of these people here tonight do not come from this area there has been a lot of scare mongering in port germein
1603 despite stephen vormister and mrs perovic saying that the rates wont go up it does not take an einstein to realise they will
1604 but someone put up a notice in the post office
1605 i remember one morning i was heading for a roundabout when an angelic grade one student pulled the pin on the fire extinguisher covering myself and the windscreen with a sea of green foam and it was only due to the angel on my shoulder that we and a few kids on bikes escaped serious injury
1606 i felt privileged to have been involved with an event which obviously was a special occasion for a group of young adults who face challenges every day
1607 i want to thank all who offered me challenges in my life and had faith in me they know who they are for without them my life would not have been half as interesting or fulfilling

1614 im currently packing up really quick to hop on the plane and head to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let all of you know first that theres no chance of me competing in beijing the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything

1636 lo que dice la biblia sobre el amor eterno es mentira ning n hombre ama a una mujer del mismo modo toda la vida por eso invent el contrato conductual conyugal para tratar a las parejas que tienen problemas si hasta para comprar un ticket de avi n uno necesita firmar un contrato c mo no va a tener el matrimonio un contrato que debe ser negociado no se or la fase de la luna de miel va a pasar de modo que cada cierto tiempo hay que determinar las bases del contrato de pareja
1637 el otro d a en una reuni n de la comisi n parlamentaria sobre seguridad hice pasar un momento dif cil a algunos diputados cuando dije que todos los l deres que yo hab a conocido o presupon a conocer eran hombres autoritarios dije que yo no hab a conocido a cristo pero que estaba seguro de que cristo tambi n hab a sido un l der autoritario y a ad que no importaba el rea en que hab an aplicado su autoritarismo para no hablar de pinochet o de hitler sino que la personalidad del l der es necesariamente autoritaria cada l der la maneja a su manera como ghandi pero el autoritarismo es propio de quien ejerce el poder por cierto que se ofendieron un poco las diputadas cristianas porque yo estaba insinuando que cristo no es dios

1640 bol var fue un asesino un demagogo que le robo las ideas a miranda
1641 the only problem i had was that the steering wheel was on the wrong side
1642 we figured we had expired all our expertise and we needed someone to take us to the next level
1643 like any program as they develop we had to develop other clubs around the state are doing the same thing its getting to be where you almost have to hire a director of coaching
1644 someone was waiting for me at the airport and ive been looked after ever since
1645 i feel a little like royalty the way ive been treated
1646 he certainly had the same ideas and philosophies we had
1647 his references sold the whole thing it was an our gain their loss deal with all of them sorry to hear he was leaving
1648 he wants to take it slow and observe things and go to a couple games here and go to a couple games in portland to scope out the competition
1649 development programs have to be age appropriate and skill appropriate it takes some time to work through it
1650 i still have contacts with manchester united because ive been involved with them since i was about 4 years old
1651 through those contacts we were able to become the western australian development club
1652 my involvement into soccer was getting so much that i was more or less two jobs
1653 i was in holland in 1984 and it was the first time i saw the small sided games
1654 i really liked what i saw it has a huge impact on kids and its the way to go
1655 it may not have been exactly where some of these guys wanted to be but they have worked their tails off
1656 on that particular day he made that choice and felt that it wasnt necessary the reality in this particular instance chances are it wouldnt have made any difference
1657 red bull flugtag challenges teams of everyday people to build homemade human powered flying machines and pilot them off a 30 foot high deck in hopes of achieving flight
1658 my friend just looked me up and down and said youre the pilot
1659 when we were getting gung ho about the idea we said whod be willing to pilot
1660 and i firmly and cheerfully encourage my county commissioners to instruct your county employees to do a lot better job
1661 and in my job i cant choose which state laws im going to enforce and not enforce
1662 having a bunch of extra signs in intersections is detrimental to traffic safety
1663 this is our opportunity as a family within the store to pick somebody to help
1664 these ones touch a little closer to home for us
1665 itll be nice when its all painted and the carpet is in
1666 it allows activists to file lawsuits more easily based on claims that industrial activity will harm the species
1667 clearly efforts need to be made to protect species but the methods under which that is done shouldnt put species before people
1668 when we file suit well have to provide more information on the impact of the polar bear listing on the clients
1669 were going to need to establish the link between our claim and the actual impacts
1670 one of reason we felt we needed to be involved in this suit is because the alaska suit does not cover all the objections
1671 there are indications that the suspects had a reason for choosing the location
1672 i just looked at him and i said what are you doing
1673 this is a strong arm robbery we need to get to california fast
1674 when dr knee hip comes in he is going to ask me maybe 3 questions touch 1 place and then i will scream he is a very dangerous man
1675 for a beautiful rubia like you i would cut it off
1676 yes the argentine man is so wonderful until he knows he has you he is willing to do anything even cut his head off
1677 for the milonga i would cut my head off for you no more i live for the milonga and to dance with you inside the milonga outside the milong there is no milonga
1678 maybe you do not want to be but you are
1679 nena come to my milonga some time i miss you
1680 you know there is a lot of food to eat
1681 i dont really like the taste of it i mean i eat chicken and seafood before i came here i didnt eat chicken
1682 koreans dont eat chicken they eat meat and maybe a little seafood meat is very important in the korean diet
1683 it will be ok food and me always works out
1684 you know i sit here all night and listen to argentines say shitty things about how the foreigners dance tango how the foreigners ruin tango fine you are correct but argentines do not dance rock and roll you dance some other dance where did rock and roll come from the usa now you call this dance foxtrot and it is not foxtrot where did foxtrot come from the usa why is it argentines can screw up everyone elses dances and say it is ok
1685 who knows i dont think i will ever understand these men here they are too weird for me
1686 hopefully i will go out and shoot an even better round tomorrow
1687 i love the game so i still want to come out and play but retirement is getting closer ill play the rest of this year and then re evaluate
1688 it just seems that i cannot put 18 holes together
1689 its just so disappointing that i dont seem to be able to pull it together
1690 im thrilled to be a part of this organisation for the long term
1691 chicago is where i have always wanted to be im looking forward to getting back on the court with my teammates and helping this team get back to the playoffs
1692 signing luol has always been a priority for this organisation and we have always felt that he was a big part of our future
1693 we are very happy that luol will now be with us long term as we continue to grow as an organisation
1694 with manny in the middle of the lineup it will certainly get other peoples attention it is not going to be easy in pitchers minds to get through this lineup
1695 it was just five months before the qualifying window for the 2008 olympics opened and it seemed crazy for a seasoned shooter like me to undergo a total change from my shooting style to my equipment
1696 i had to un learn and re learn everything over a span of 15 months basically whatever id learnt through trial and error over the last 20 odd years had to be thrown out
1697 marcello stressed a lot on my shooting stance and the timing
1698 every shot i took was carefully structured and prepared unlike the past when id just turn up and shoot
1699 his attention to detail is also very great he would make me shoot the same target at the same trajectory over and over again until i got it right
1700 it was very intense and there were moments of friction between us
1701 marcello also knew when to take it easy sometimes he would take all of us into town and head for this spa for elderly people for us to relax
1702 i dont know if it is going to be my last olympics it will depend on what resources are available
1703 but if there are better trap shooters then i would be happy to make way for them
1704 it was a special day and my whole family came up
1705 when i hit two home runs i was kind of puffing my chest until my dad said well those balls in your high school field probably would have been flyouts to right but dont worry about it
1706 for us to get the second round were getting some really good teams
1707 its going to be great games in our pool and with the international diversity of south florida a lot of people are going to see their countries play whether its the dominican or venezuela puerto rico u s a canada
1708 people are going to come out and watch these games and the passion for their country will certainly be on display
1709 i think by baseball selecting us its sending a nice message to everybody about how strongly they feel about miami and the support we have for baseball
1710 i think it exemplifies mlbs dedication to miami and i think its a great step for us
1711 we have to sell baseball at the grassroots level and our fan base has to grow significantly by the time we get into the new facility and the more people who are exposed to baseball i think it helps us sell the game to people and helps people become a fan of baseball
1712 i was confident that we had a really good chance just because the efforts and the quality of our proposal both financially and with the detail we attended to it
1713 i feel like we responded very favorably to all the expectations
1714 this is the gateway to the americas and i think it was a natural destination for mlb
1715 we hope to demonstrate the uniqueness of our location the quality of the diversity of this marketplace and we think that combination with the timing of the season with tourism at its peak can generate positive results
1716 i think theyll be highly motivated to think about us again in the future to host the games
1717 we didnt have a lot of time to get it done so it tends to move a lot faster the last 24 hours i was surprised they obviously had a need for another bat in their lineup and a need for another outfielder i know white sox gm kenny williams had interest in junior in the past and looked at this as a good opportunity to add him to his club
1718 he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it i think its a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
1719 it was a lot more brief than i thought it was going to be
1720 it was kind of shocking all of sudden bam it was done he is still going to be a friend of mine im upset that hes leaving but its a good situation for him he wants to win a ring the white sox are in first place and he has a chance
1721 he wasnt having his best year but he was just getting hot
1722 you wont be able to fill those shoes no one is ken griffey jr its the end of an era in cincinnati he got hurt a lot but was one of the top five best to ever step on the field
1723 hes one of the best four or five hitters in baseball
1724 i like him yet he marches to his own drummer i had him in the all star game it doesnt make sense to me that he would be available
1725 we had some things that we were looking at that we were trying to improve mainly with the pen and we did that with rhodes
1726 we were trying to add catching depth and we banged on i think every door if we didnt its our fault as far as any other opportunities yes there were other opportunities that we wanted to explore because we like to be active with the minutes ticking we wanted to take advantage of it why some of those things didnt come to fruition could be a number of factors it could be the money the players to somebody else had different goals than we did
1727 we had conversations that went right down to the wire
1728 and whenever you have that obviously you feel like theres a chance but it takes two teams and by definition trades are difficult to make and weve worked extremely hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a pick and improve the team but at the end of the day we didnt find something that lined up for us
1729 i know there was a lot out there the way we view that is that the trade deadline is an opportunity for us to examine ways to improve our club we did that we had a lot of discussions a few of them led right up to the deadline but obviously nothing came to fruition
1730 we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point were i was calling owner tom hicks for the final signoff
1731 the last four or five days obviously weve been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios
1732 but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal
1733 negotiations with aek reached a happy end now with my teammates i will try to reach this years goals ones that are of course high
1734 we got a report wednesday night that hes improving but still feels it when he runs
1735 hes healthy just tired he knew monday that he would rest so this was just a good day for him

1742 even though im not really into vampires i enjoy the books
1743 theyre not really bloody or gory theyre more romantic and passionate
1744 are you going to give me a ticket or a warning

1766 many of the issues effecting farmers back then still plague us today
1767 the nature of the problems has changed a lot but farmers and the organisation have adapted amazingly over the years to show great improvements in productivity environmental care and understanding of the international markets
1768 it is even worse today compounded by the drought over the past decade the high australian dollar and subsidised international competition making the economics of farming very difficult
1769 these men along with many other members have helped build the association the knowledge and experience they have is incredible

1788 said they were very confident of their ability to predict what their newsrooms would look like five years from now
1789 the majority of bloggers and internet addicts like the endless rows of talking heads on television do not report
1790 they are largely parasites who cling to traditional news outlets they rarely pick up the phone much less go out and find a story nearly all reporting i would guess at least 80 percent is done by newspapers and the wire services take that away and we have a huge black hole

1792 with the american housing market in its worst crisis since the great depression of the 1930s president bush is authorising new legislation to pave the way for massive new government intervention designed to slow the slide
1793 second while our overall growth has outpaced inflation americas income has also become much more highly concentrated at the top the paychecks of 9 out of 10 americans have actually declined over the past three decades its been bill gates and his set who have done extremely well during that time as a result of both of these shifts theres now a significant gap between the economy in which most americans live and work and the one discussed in the business pages and on the cable news blab fests

1813 were going to see what we can do about the mysterious mr mikell
1814 hes got a long way to go lots of surgery hell need prosthesis
1815 but its kind of a hike to get to it and there is no supervision there

1818 it was all together but it was a blueish colour
1819 the urgent problem with reattaching a limb is getting blood supply to the muscle as soon as possible
1820 after four hours without blood you begin to get irreversible damage to the muscle and if the muscle dies it can become infected
1821 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1822 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
1823 weve mobilized a fair amount of equipment and well do whatever it takes to get the road open as fast as we can
1824 we have complete confidence in the ministry of transportation that when the road is complete were going to have minimal issues with it and its going to be safe

1826 in the aftermath of the slide those people that had flights out or commitments had to do a bit of scrambling but now people are generally ok
1827 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
1828 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
1829 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
1830 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
1831 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him

1839 theres got to be some changes to the investigation process allowing for some sort of civilian investigation especially in really serious allegations in custody deaths and serious injuries
1840 these are the cases that immediately should be taken out of the hands of internal police forces
1841 its people wanting that satisfaction having an honest belief that what they really want is for the officer not to do that again and be disciplined for what they thought was wrong and just not having an avenue to do it
1842 one of the changes that im personally aware of is increasing the oversight role of the office of the police complaint commissioner throughout the process of an investigation so it will provide additional independent oversight pretty much from the start of an investigation
1843 the police officer who broke my arm should be charged with assault causing bodily harm at the very least
1844 the most disturbing thing about this is that theyre behaving like its a police state
1845 im a citizen of canada with charter rights i pay my taxes ergo i pay their salaries and theyve sworn an oath to serve and protect me
1846 it has been my observation that in sensitive and serious investigations that the resolve of internal investigators to vigorously investigate their own members will too often stand in marked distinction to the approach the same investigators might take with a civilian accused of the same conduct
1847 resulta conveniente fortalecer los mecanismos existentes para intercambiar informaci n reforzar la capacidad investigativa de nuestras instituciones y mejorar las herramientas de cooperaci n judicial y policial ya existentes
1848 se ha avanzado pero se insiste mucho en que no quede s lo en las conclusiones y en las actas sino que se pasen a compromisos efectivos ya que es un problema global
1849 eso lo que lleva es a seguir concientizando a los pa ses en el tema de la necesidad de la responsabilidad compartida de la cooperaci n entre los pa ses en poder controlar tanto la migraci n de los traficantes como el lavado de activos y el tr fico de estupefacientes
1850 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue

1859 we have two different projects that are at least vaguely in the works on the iphone
1860 pure graphics wise the iphone is about equivalent to a dreamcast but if you were to compare it to a console its pretty close to a previous generation console
1861 while the graphics arent that high up youve got a lot more ram
1862 armani jeans expresses my vision of a young independent casual lifestyle with a strong and cool fashion sensibility solange epitomises this style perfectly and brings to it that swing so evident in her new single i decided

1864 we have ab unch of new stuff that were going to show here
1865 because it seems that senator obama has made his decision to offer the slot on the ticket to another candidate we believe that continuing to ask him to pick hillary is no longer helpful to our partys chances of winning in november
1866 thats when reality hit i just sat there in the middle of the track with the snow coming down just numb thinking im sick of this im sick of the injuries
1867 im thinking i havent run without pain for six years now im getting married soon im about to become a father im not making any money i just dont want to do this any more
1868 the only thing i remember is people jumping out at me and offering me prawns on a fork or a can of fosters afterwards i felt like a complete loser someone just making up the numbers

1878 epas irresponsible inappropriate decision has failed navajo communities and needlessly sacrificed our air land and water
1879 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
1880 this air permit seriously undermines regional efforts to clean up the air and promote renewable energy projects
1881 if the coal plant is built it will add to health problems already facing tribal members and residents of both new mexico and colorado
1882 this is a political decision not one based on science or epas own mandate
1883 epa ramrodded this permit out the door in response to a lawsuit filed by the coal plant owner whose lawyer jeff holmstead was a high level epa official in the bush administration it looks like hes still giving orders to epas staff
1884 is epas rush to judgment on this permit decision sithe complains that the epa should have issued the permit several years ago but the whole reason this is taking so long is because the concept for desert rock is faulty epa still hasnt finished a thorough evaluation of the project but its allowing a former agency official to bully it into rushing this permit out the door
1885 we plan to vigorously contest the permit to prevent a tremendous setback to the efforts of state and local governments and dedicated citizens to rein in global warming pollution and to protect the health of area residents
1886 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1887 according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch

1895 there were years the club didnt win as many games as it lost the chicken provided one of the most crucial elements of any baseball game enhancing the fan experience he always complemented the game
1896 we abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us when we see land as a community to which we belong we may begin to use it with love and respect
1897 great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds
1898 something had to be done it took me a little while and some very frustrating prototypes but eventually i did it
1899 my child would never do that are you sure it was my child

1904 everyone with the red cross was patient helpful and sympathetic
1905 as a former auditor chaudhry would know that all audits are checked out against laid down general amp finance orders and any transaction that is done outside the stipulated general orders becomes questionable
1906 yet here we have a former auditor now minister supporting an unbudgeted payment while the current auditor general has not commented until announcing the investigation
1907 and even if there are cases where accrued leave is paid it is usually for a limited period of time only

1910 what happened to loraine tevi and sereana qoro reflects on how far the church can go to threaten people and i appeal to them to go easy on us because i am also a methodist and i have the right to choose
1911 the church cannot let us choose between our faith and our families because we need to earn a living to support our families
1912 hopefully before they leave within the next day or so they would have signed a memorandum of association moa thereafter well proceed to build the facilities for them

1916 intensive research has been devoted to the development of hypoglycemia alarms
1917 hypoglycemia alarm dogs could provide an important aid to patients with poor awareness of symptoms particularly those prone to night time episodes or who live alone
1918 pets may help patients with type 1 diabetes through aiding them when hypoglycemic
1919 reduced awareness of hypoglycemia and does not wake up during nocturnal episodes
1920 take canine glucose sensing to a new level of sophistication
1921 all were clearly able to sense hypoglycemia accurately under circumstances when the patients themselves were initially unaware of falling glucose levels
1922 formal calculations of sensitivity and specificity are not possible but each dog showed his or her specific behaviors only when the patient had documented hypoglycemia
1923 research is urgently needed to determine whether dogs can be trained to recognize and react to early signs of hypoglycemia
1924 dexter is my baby and has never sat on the couch with anyone but me
1925 if i am not in the room he sits on the floor
1926 she was not aware of her low blood sugar as soon as i fed her and got her blood sugars to come back up dexter was back on the floor laying in his usual spot
1927 i thought maybe it was just a coincidence but the next time i saw dexter sitting with becka and licking her face i immediately grabbed the meter even though it was not testing time
1928 she was 54 mg dl that time she had not felt any of these lows herself but the dog had
1929 becka knows that if dexter licks her incessantly to test her sugar and tell me or her dad
1930 every time he has licked her she has been low he seems to be able to pick up anything below 60 mg dl
1931 at first i thought it was just coincidence however it has happened too many times over the last three years
1932 i dont know if i thrash mumble snore or breathe differently when my blood sugar levels drop but regardless she is always pushing me with her paws
1933 she takes a running start and hits me with both her front paws
1934 frosty was a lifesaver in waking me up when i was sleeping and incurring a low blood sugar
1935 after a few weeks i realized that just before i did my finger sticks she began to whine and cry
1936 on days when i would tell her its not good today she would bring me her rawhide chew
1937 when i have a hypo and head for the truck the young and middle aged dogs follow and jump in excitement
1938 my cat angora whom ive had for about 15 years woke me up on one occasion by pawing at me and meowing to get my attention
1939 it was a time in my life before i was married and before i was in tight control so i didnt have very many lows
1940 democracy now kucinich keeps rolling that impeach boulder over mt pelosi
1941 i thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country
1942 so that americans can really see the crimes bush and cheney have committed
1943 ifsomebody had a crime bush had committed sic that would be different
1944 i thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country
1945 well i think that it i think it was important when i became speaker and its by the way a very important position i saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could
1946 and you cant do that if youre trying to impeach the president at the same time unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes
1947 i thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country
1948 the most common of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably not true it is the chief occupation of mankind

1956 its important to note that this was not a weight loss study
1957 the participants could eat whatever they wanted they could have been eating dessert every night no one told them not to
1958 insulin delivery based on carbohydrate counting is the gold standard for improving glycemic control in type 1 diabetes
1959 if the diabetes is recognized sooner it can be treated sooner this leads to a longer life a better quality of life and lower medical related costs over the life span of the patient
1960 most patients we diagnose come to us because of a sudden change in vision maybe their vision is blurry and they have never worn glasses and they are concerned we are often the first doctor they see we end up being the ones who determine they have diabetes and refer them to other medical experts for follow up treatment
1961 everybody has to get on the same page when it comes to treating the person with diabetes
1962 from the eye doctor the dentist the podiatrist and the family doctor to the endocrinologist we all have to know whats going on with the patient and the patient needs to understand the ramifications of the disease
1963 to join in a day of prayer and fasting that such offenses never happen again
1964 we dont talk as much about the experience of illness as we talk about how to get over it how to stop it how to prevent it how to relieve it how you can be healthy if you really try we dont look inside the suffering past the wall of suffering to see whats behind it i think theres an enormous body of knowledge out there among people who are suffering that is untapped and if we could tap into it more wed be less afraid and wed know more how to cope when it happens to us
1965 any establishment which dispenses food for consumption on or off the premises and which has the following characteristics a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
1966 man f rst r sig inte p hur snuskiga folk kan vara men det verkar som om man st tt och kissat rakt in i kaklet p toaletterna
1967 problemet r att de inte tar p sig ett par rena kalsonger under badbyxorna utan att de har anv nts minst en dag eller flera det finns helt ekelt m nsklig avf ring i kalsongerna
1968 there are matters which have arisen which would have caused anybody very considerable concern
1969 the evidence has demonstrated that the practice of beasting which clearly falls outside appropriate military discipline was going on in these barracks openly and must have been known to senior officers
1970 many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustnt be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge
1971 the conclusion of the trial allows the royal military police now to conduct a full investigation into his death
1972 this will examine whether there were any breaches of military law a decision can then be made on further action i am unable to comment until this investigation concludes
1973 left no stone unturned in their effort to establish the full circumstances
1974 we are devastated with the outcome of the verdicts today we have come this far we owe it to gavin that nobody elses child goes through what happened to gavin
1975 we have all been hung out to dry its been really stressful i feel great sympathy for gavin williams family beasting is happening all the time the army should address it
1976 i really do struggle to see why we make it so easy for people to fly domestically when you have got such a low carbon alternative in rail its something that should be positively promoted
1977 we want to get more inbound and outbound flight rotations at stansted but we would like to get to the position where all trips between london and edinburgh are done by train
1978 i subscribe to the view that you will see people taking more uk holidays
1979 there are an awful lot of smoky old diesel trains out there the lowest carbon alternative is eurostar and you have to recognise that it is mostly powered by nuclear generated electricity
1980 the commissions view is that it would not be able to issue finalised guidance in this area until the relevant primary legislation had received royal assent and the commission had carefully considered the wider context in which guidance would operate and consulted widely on the content of the guidance
1981 the commission also strongly supports the recommendation from the review of the 2007 scottish elections that no changes to the rules surrounding elections should be applied to an election held within six months of those changes coming into force
1982 it is a perfectly understandable reaction on the part of the electoral commission they could well end up in a situation where they are called on to address whether a candidates expenses are political without legal clarity at which point they know they will face all sorts of challenges
1983 a london guide for the soul if there ever was one you can laugh and cry on the same page
1984 it needs better lighting but luckily for my summer mood i was let off without demands for re writes
1985 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
1986 it is difficult to think of anything other than the threat of unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity of the extradition process as to require the accused to be discharged irrespective of the case against him
1987 the post office card account is vital for the future stability of the post office if the government does not award the contract to the post office it could sound the deathknell for the countrys network of post offices
1988 losing the post office card account contract would undermine the sustainability of the post office network and would inevitably lead to the closure of around 3 000 post offices
1989 the impact would be felt by the most vulnerable in society those least able to travel to an alternative outlet due to poor transport availability economic geographic or mobility factors in addition to more job losses
1990 had a text message drawn him away from the falling apple at just the wrong moment

1994 two others said they had knowledge of human remains at the location but were not specific a local advocate also came to police and said he had a client who knew there were human remains buried at the home
1995 if the dating remains as inconclusive as what we have had so far a homicide inquiry is unlikely

2000 i drive to the station every day and i get the train to work
2001 my carbon footprint is not particularly good i need to plant a forest immediately
2002 the perceived cost of motoring has gone up so people are questioning how often they use their cars
2003 something is different people are using trains more because of motoring costs and other factors such as congestion maybe we have gone through that tipping point
2004 i can imagine that he would be a pretty exacting guy to work for
2005 thats probably still true i am more tolerant than i used to be there is a limit though when you rely on other people and you have to do your job through them
2006 its not until the trade unions punch you in the eyes and say no that you turn into an older and wiser manager those that never have to experience the word no are poorer for it
2007 it was a wholly political decision it was from no 10 and the department for transport was told to get on with it i am sticking my neck out but i dont really care
2008 i am not surprised inevitably on value for money you are always going to get poor results if that rate of fare increase continues it is going to feel more and more expensive particularly when people might be feeling the pinch
2009 im giving myself enough rope but i would like to retain this franchise if i can do that i feel it will be job done
2010 when i started my career people talked down buses i had a rather strange job to a lot of people
2011 there is a huge challenge in the bus industry to replace my generation that joined in the 1970s early in my career we managed decline as car ownership increased and the use of buses fell away now we are on the cusp of an opportunity to start building again and we need new young managers to help with the process
2012 the time for consideration of such a drastic measure has not yet been reached it would be premature at the present time strict enforcement would have undesirable effects on relations between police and public many of whom would justifiably resent prosecutions and convictions relating to failure to take precautions which in no way affect the safety of any other road users
2013 there is no doubt that the police would incur unpopularity any further deterioration in the good relationship between police and public is to be deplored but it is difficult to see how this could be avoided
2014 a patrol car driver would have the additional difficulty of taking his eyes from the road to check vehicles which he passes
2015 dwarfs and persons who are deformed grossly obese exceptionally tall or have other permanent physical characteristics
2016 some old people opposed or indifferent to seat belts would deprive themselves of the pleasure they get from a car outing rather than put up with the nuisance involved in what they regard as an unnecessary newfangled idea most old people are law abiding and the conflict between conscience and desire to go for a drive with the family is easy to foresee
2017 women who object to the feel of the belt over their breasts should not be exempted the evidence also indicates that if an impact is of sufficient force to kill an unborn child the collision would be of such severity that the mother would probably be killed unless she was wearing a seat belt a woman who wears a belt and survives while her baby dies does not sacrifice her unborn childs life she simply avoids the futile sacrifice of her own
2018 life is short the art is long opportunity fleeting experience delusive judgment difficult

2023 what is happening in this country is something we never knew before
2024 there is a callousness in this society it is ungodly
2025 considering how it could have been it is relatively minor injuries lots of walking wounded
2026 everyone involved has been incredibly lucky if it hadnt been for the soft landing on the verge i think the injuries would have been a lot more serious
2027 if the bus had rolled on to the roadside rather than on to gorse it could have been more serious the driver did his best to get the casualties out of the bus so they were very lucky

2035 we both came into the profession in the 80s when there was a generation of young lawyers concerned about miscarriages of justice and making the law more accessible not speaking arcane language that no one could understand you would not find keir customarily in wing collar and stripy trousers
2036 traditionally the police have had their hands on the prosecution of cases and that has to change it has to be more of a partnership with the prosecuting lawyer following the case through taking the ultimate decisions prosecutors have an ethical obligation to decide in the public interest there is no incongruity that someone who has been a defence lawyer should know best how to look at a case from the other side
2037 whenever one of us left home they replaced us with a donkey
2038 i had the idea of changing things for the better i was always interested in constitutional issues and politics i thought id become a solicitor but then the idea of actually presenting an argument being the person who got up in court began to appeal

2052 one of the biggest mistakes our school system has made in the last decade was eliminating the alternative school i think it would be awesome if you became an english teacher and brought back the alternative school your professional and academic success having come through an alternative school yourself would be an inspiration for many of the students who mistakenly believe or have been repeatedly told they have no value and no future as for teaching hunter s thompson i have doubts that the school board would approve this author even though his works have clear literary value because of the graphic and adult nature of his novels
2053 for this particular product i will be revisiting whether we keep it in the market or not once we have clarified things we may pull this particular one where it goes to the lawyer specifically for the down payment
2054 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
2055 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
2056 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
2057 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
2058 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
2059 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity
2060 i dont think anything that went on in these chambers affected him
2061 his entire life as best i can tell is one in which hes always been a thoughtful listener and questioner but hes never stepped up to the plate and taken full swings

2117 all the passengers had to spend the night on the planes or in the departure hall
2118 no one came to tend to their food and board
2119 the car was picked up by the water and washed under the fence
2120 there was a hollow under the fence his car was sucked through that and 200 300 metres out into paddocks by the time we got there some bystanders had got him out of the car and he was sitting on a grassy nob just beyond it
2121 three quarters of his car was under water if they hadnt got him out he mightnt have made it
2122 we went in there with a scoop stretcher and a couple of guys and brought him back through the water to the road
2123 he was swept into the paddock and stayed in the car until some locals and the fire service got him out they were standing in water that was at least waist deep

2130 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me
2131 but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2132 when you are working in an existing building you dont know what you will encounter until you begin work and tear down walls it covers anything you cant see
2133 its not an overly high amount but it should cover the town should anything happen in the building the building is in unknown condition right now and the money will be there if is its needed or go back if its not

2135 i think in the end the sccf committee and the bos have demonstrated responsible leadership by providing a plan for a beautiful new home for our seniors and a community center for the people of swansea and we will have done so without raising taxes its up to the voters on aug 18th to determine if they concur
2136 i gave them the bare minimum of 580 000 with a lot of side options they chose not to do like painting improved floor covering elevator and others
2137 then the committee started kicking around why not put in an elevator and why not replace the sprinklers and here we are

2139 stealing cash stealing economic value is a crime its a crime in every system i know of taking property thats not yours thats a crime but when were dealing with virtual property that question might get a little more sophisticated how do we know whats somebodys and whats not somebody elses
2140 particularly if there is a set of algorithms or rules in the game that everything is free for the taking that might is right so we have to be very careful about terms like stealing because stealing might be clearly illegal clearly criminal and thats nothing new weve done that for millennia or it might be part of the gameplay at which point it is not illegal its encouraged as part of the overall interrelationships between the residents of the environment
2141 there is no one single approach taken by the providers of the virtual environments some virtual worlds such as second life were designed to include a minimum amount of governance residents of these worlds were expected to establish their community behavioral norms other virtual worlds include strong governance and control in these worlds such as the provider of the environment sets and enforces clear rules for behavior
2142 these are things that people can or cannot do to each other based on the way the virtual world operator has designed their environment violating these rules is simply impossible because the gameplay doesnt allow it to occur the code doesnt function that way
2143 who governs virtual world environments they are governed by criminal laws governed by torts governed by the virtual world providers rules and they are governed by social norms
2144 its a joint responsibility everyone provides a piece of the puzzle we have our criminal system that provides a piece of the puzzle our judicial system that enforces torts that provides a piece of the puzzle we have our virtual world provider and then the community itself does its own enforcement and that is a piece of the puzzle its a shared responsibility and it would be a mistake to focus on only one aspect
2145 congress has said for the most part they are not responsible for policing their own environments its totally up to them to decide how little or how much they want to do they might decide they want to make their world a police state and will regulate users interactions with each other very tightly 47 usc 230 says they can do that and they are not liable for the way they execute that philosophy
2146 similarly they can say were going to have a lawless environment and 47 usc 230 says if they want to do that they are still not responsible when people engage in bad behavior toward one another
2147 there are numerous gatekeepers in the virtual world safeguarding against numerous types of inappropriate behavior
2148 in second life for instance gatekeepers include our payment and credit card partners and our fraud and risk teams who guard against credit card fraud money laundering and phishing they also include our own governance team the g team which investigates abuse reports and guards against inappropriate content against teens on the adult grid etc and in many cases they include our own users who protect the space and land they inhabit
2149 as with any online community there are occasionally those who seek to disrupt others enjoyment but were able to effectively deal with any repeat disruptors by increasing the severity of the ban up to and including permanently terminating accounts
2150 virtual worlds that incorporate content that is inappropriate for minors generally require users to declare that they are old enough to participate most worlds that allow adult content provide clear warnings concerning the content
2151 avatars are not people they cannot be assaulted sexually or otherwise the one or two reports of sexual assault on avatars cannot be regarded as actual cases of assault any more than a description of an assault in a book or enacted in a play can be construed as being an actual assault

2161 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the american people
2162 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
2163 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector

2170 there is no point voting labour any more there are no safe labour seats
2171 they will lose every by election they fight in this parliament and at the next general election they will lose in their heartlands to the liberal democrats a labour vote is now a wasted vote
2172 the truth is there are huge parts of the country where they havent got a hope
2173 not even a single elected councillor in newcastle sheffield manchester liverpool or oxford let alone an mp places where only the liberal democrats can defeat labour
2174 this is a huge opportunity for us weve got to seize it so im shifting our resources to put more campaigners and more effort into those seats where were taking on labour
2175 ive instructed our campaigns chief chris rennard to step up our campaigns in the 50 seats where were best placed to beat labour
2176 well be launching a special fundraising drive for those constituencies in the autumn and i hope youll help
2177 you never know how quickly things will change gordon brown may find the guts to call the general election we should have had last year

2181 the wind comes over the hill and it blasts down these valleys we get more wind up here than they get in the bottom of the pohangina valley

2192 i saw pearl jam at madison square garden last night it was incredible
2193 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
2194 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet muhammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
2195 i hope my father and family open their eyes to jesus and the kingdom of god
2196 a surgical internship of the type we are hosting provides training that is the equivalent of a phd it takes just as much time and effort but provides a different pathway to high end skills
2197 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
2198 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
2199 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this

2202 its got length its got rough its got tough greens so you need to be on your game
2203 as i decided to put in some time and some work it certainly has made me gain a lot more desire to show my family who i am as a golfer

2205 ive said for quite some time ive been playing quite well and not getting anything out of it
2206 i went there to royal birkdale feeling very good about my golf and i played quite well in very trying conditions for four days and took a lot out of it
2207 weve taken this action as a prudent response to the current extraoridnary market conditions that have resulted in higher than usual redemptions in the fund not matched by fresh investment
2208 because property is a long term investment and the assets are not immediately realisable these types of provisions are common to these types of funds to ensure that the interests of investors are protected during periods of market volatility
2209 in the current market where investors are looking to reduce their exposure to property investments we believe we are acting in the best interests of investors by temporarily suspending activity to preserve the quality of the fund
2210 people are going to write hateful stuff about me and thats fine with me good rounds and low scores can solve everything
2211 news scores amp more on your cell phone get it now
2212 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
2213 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
2214 i dont think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me im ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but its not the end of the world for me
2215 i play 16 to 18 tournaments a year and get the rest off
2216 and i like what i do so i just play im not sure that im going to play next year but i have plans to finish out this year and then im going to re evaluate and see but im getting close

2219 we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
2220 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
2221 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
2222 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
2223 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody laying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
2224 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation
2225 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
2226 its a big concern for the officers to keep this guy out of traffic to keep him from getting hurt
2227 this lethal disturbance in the heart rhythm was precipitated by the agitated state and associated stress as well as the use of the conducted energy weapon taser designed for incapacitation through electro muscular disruption
2228 where have all the most appealing men gone married young most of them and sometimes to women whose most salient characteristic was not their beauty or passion or intellect but their decisiveness

2267 lo que nos dej sin figuras adem s recibimos al iddf hace muy poco tiempo y no dio oportunidad de pensar en algo mejor
2268 pero es mejor dejarlo todo como est y seguir con el apoyo como gobierno lo que ya estaba estructurado por la administraci n pasada
2269 el llamado a la selecci n es algo muy especial que me deja muy contento es como un sue o que uno tiene desde chico ser jugador profesional jugar en un equipo grande jugar una final ganarla llegar a la selecci n jugar un mundial
2270 creo que todos de ni os tuvimos ese sue o y hoy tengo la posibilidad de estar en la selecci n y espero aprovecharla
2271 no me gusta hacer comparaciones l hugo s nchez ha logrado cosas muy importantes con pumas a mi este equipo me ha hecho crecer como jugador y como persona y l ha logrado sus primeros dos campeonatos con pumas y ahora llega para m el llamado a la selecci n
2272 yo siempre voy a respetar a los cr ticos que est n en contra a lo mejor esto pasa much simo en europa y se ve como algo m s normal mientras en m xico todav a hay mucha cr tica con los naturalizados
2273 yo voy a tratar de trabajar tratar de dar lo mejor en pro de la selecci n
2274 eso no cabe aqu saber si es necesario uno o m s creo que el jugador que vaya a la selecci n debe creer en el trabajo que se va a hacer y pensar que est en una selecci n muy importante a nivel mundial debe pensar en tratar de ir a la selecci n sin importar los nombres
2275 un indicativo de que hay competencia en la cancha y que l va a pelear por un puesto y me parece excelente
2276 platicamos muy seguido estamos en contacto con l ojal se quede muchos a os m s hay que ir viendo como se desarrolla el torneo tenemos tiempo para ver como evolucionan las cosas
2277 lo que se busca es ganar campeonatos y tener a los mejores jugadores mexicanos o extranjeros si la visi n que tienen otros equipos es de vender futbolistas es la suya nosotros queremos ganar campeonatos y tener lo mejor
2278 se negoci en el draft con puebla no se present con el equipo y para nosotros ese tema est muerto
2279 en lo que respecta a cruz azul todos sab amos que hay torneos importantes y que se report el equipo pensando en posible convocatoria y en la cantidad de partidos que iban a ver y parece algo raro por la cifra de jugadores que constantemente han sido llamados y que han sido pieza importante en la selecci n
2280 parece que en este momento le est n dando prioridad a los equipos para que puedan contar con plantel completo y en su momento seguramente habr bastantes convocados de este equipo
2281 lo m s bonito y que todo jugador quiere es estar en la selecci n y despu s competir en un mundial en este momento los clubes estar n agradecidos porque no se llevan a sus jugadores y pr ximamente habr oportunidad para que est n en la selecci n
2282 uno quisiera partirse en dos estar con la selecci n y con tu equipo porque son partidos importantes pero esas son decisiones que fueron tomadas por la gente de la federaci n y del cuerpo t cnico de la selecci n y no queda m s que acatar rdenes
2283 me da gran alegr a que haya sido convocado l leandro augusto porque es un gran jugador y uno de mis grandes amigos es un jugador que casi toda su carrera la ha hecho aqu y que ha rendido con creces creo que es un premio al esfuerzo y dedicaci n de toda su carrera
2284 est donde est uno debe tratar de responder yo esperaba la convocatoria y llegaron a un acuerdo la directiva de cruz azul y la fmf que les convenga tanto al equipo como a los jugadores
2285 uno est bien y a gusto trabajando y ahora que viene este torneo hay que tratar de ganarlo
2286 lo nico que queremos aclarar es que hubo una propuesta de galatasaray de turqu a y es una oferta que tanto al jugador como para el club no es satisfactoria es a pr stamo cosa que no creemos sea la manera adecuada para el equipo y para ochoa
2287 estamos en la mejor disposici n de revisar propuestas y evaluarlas cuando tengamos algo que tanto al jugador como al club le llene el ojo vamos a tomar una decisi n
2288 pero sabemos de su inquietud tenemos que respetar su desarrollo profesional vamos a evaluar todo lo que llegue y lo vamos a apoyar en todo lo que se pueda hacer pero la idea es que cumpla su contrato hasta el 2010
2289 es atractivo pero no a pr stamo no es lo que queremos el equipo ni yo uno trabaja para conseguir cosas importantes y no estarse regalando creo que el futbolista mexicano debe darse su lugar y saber valorarse
2290 estoy muy tranquilo porque s que con el apoyo de la directiva siempre ha estado en la mejor de las disposiciones siempre se ha platicado acerca del tema siempre se va a acceder cuando sea algo que conviene a ambas partes

2377 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilising the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
2378 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
2379 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked

2410 taking the brand of a respected hero and diminishing him to a tabloid stalker type obsessed with a popularity they themselves will never have while blaming the person for his own status with no recognition just why that status has been bestowed by some people not everyone but the more they tell people not to like him the more petty and dishonest they reveal themselves to be especially after announcing they valued debating the issues with the public not debating q ratings with the glitterati

2428 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology

2444 well it gives me hope that mr garrett is prepared to make what are at times difficult decisions
2445 the difference may well be though in the instance of the traveston crossing dam hes dealing with his mates in the queensland labor government

2458 the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law

2590 this is one of the publishing sensations of the decade we expect to triple our circulation
2591 we were able to restore function in these animals not by dosing them with estrogen but by enabling them to use the estrogen that was naturally present in their bodies
2592 we discovered that you can affect the estrogen receptor directly in the hippocampus right where its needed to address memory and spatial learning
2593 estrogen may act as a growth agent for cancer but in the brain it appears to maintain health and counteract stress
2594 we wanted to come back and enhance the signaling pathway that makes estrogen functional we used a gene therapy technique that enables us to target the brain but ultimately there could be a pharmaceutical that enhances the signaling pathway solely in the brain
2595 this research shows that when the estrogen receptor alpha is restored to adult mice that have been missing it their entire lives it is still possible to enhance memory and learning
2596 this is good news for moving forward to develop clinical interventions and therapeutics because it appears critical damage was not done to brain circuitry during early development there has also been debate about which of at least two estrogen receptors is key to synaptic health clearly estrogen receptor alpha plays a critically important role in hippocampal organization and function
2597 investigating the impact of genetically replacing the estrogen receptor at the cellular synaptic and behavioral levels is a scientific tour de force which provides a strong foundation for the role of estrogen receptor alpha in mediating estrogen action in the hippocampus to restore select types of memory function
2598 from a technology perspective their technique to transfect the estrogen receptor is an exciting advance for researching steroid receptors in the brain
2599 the research brings up the idea that local activation of non nuclear estrogen receptor alpha is important for regulating memory processes in the hippocampus

2616 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
2617 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in heart disease risk in older persons
2618 this study shows that this abundant product of fat cells is a marker and perhaps even a mediator of worsened outcomes in persons aged 65 years and older
2619 further studies should target this protein to unravel the mechanisms responsible

2626 we found a disproportionately high association between living close to a highway and birth complications among affluent mothers
2627 among affluent mothers who live within 200 metres of a highway the odds of delivering an infant with low birth weight increase by 81 percent while their odds of delivering a preterm baby increase by 58 percent compared to mothers who dont live anywhere close to expressways
2628 advantaged mothers may be more susceptible to highway pollution possibly because they have been protected from other hazards present in low income neighbourhoods
2629 we found a disproportionately high association between living close to a highway and birth complications among affluent mothers

2632 there has been a lot of interest in scaling down optical devices
2633 its really a very simple geometry and i was surprised that no one had come up with it before
2634 previously if you wanted to transmit light at a smaller scale you would lose a lot of energy along the path to retain more energy youd have to make the scale bigger these two things always went against each other
2635 now this work shows there is the possibility to gain both of them
2636 we are pulling optics down to the length scales of electrons
2637 and that means we can potentially do some things we have never done before

2676 we were looking for ways to speed up and simplify our refund process and provide better services to our student population
2677 higher one was the only solution that addressed every issue we were trying to address guaranteed bank accounts for all students including those who might otherwise be considered un bankable the ability for students to make their own choices regarding their refunds and manage those choices seven days a week if they so desire
2678 the college did not want to take on banking functions also an in house ach program would not have allowed us to provide for our students with no bank accounts
2679 i get some critiques but theyre also good with the praise
2680 as we anticipate the election of a visionary president of these united states in november we must be keenly aware of the need to send to the congress men and women who share the vision of the president and the platform from which attempts will be made to enact laws and establish policies
2681 we believe jim martin candidate for the u s senate and consistent democrat meets that standard and shares that vision we cannot afford to send to the senate a zig zag so called conservative bush supporter who by his own admission not only voted for bush one time but after having an opportunity to review his leadership for a quadrennium voted for him a second time
2682 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
2683 if you dont account or identify all of these people its easy to overestimate the results
2684 the next step is to find complementary things that can be done such as hand washing or continuing to vaccinate people who come into contact with seniors
2685 we dont have data to say which one way complements best but from the scientific side theres been a lot of talk of what the next step should be
2686 in the past five years it has really come into its own

2698 its a point of distinction for the island to have anne
2699 without her it would be a beautiful island on the northeast coast of canada desperately trying to find a point of distinction
2700 a lot of islanders quite frankly are anned to death
2701 many islanders have had it up to here with anne
2702 you cant go to a wedding without moonshine being in the punch
2703 after theyve seen anne and had their lobster supper whats there to come back for we looked at what is captivating about the seemingly ordinary
2704 if im to be dragged at annes chariot wheels the rest of my life ill bitterly repent having created her

2708 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
2709 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
2710 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
2711 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
2712 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
2713 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
2714 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met
2715 i got calls telling me i was a piece of crap
2716 i got text messages telling me i hope you blow out your knee
2717 i need to stand up for what i know is right
2718 it never wore on me those guys are a bunch of idiots
2719 but when i left ohio state was the only school i ever considered
2720 youre not going to let justin go to ohio state are you
2721 you dont let him go to ohio state tell him where to go
2722 that was definitely something in the back of my mind
2723 hes a first class guy and down to earth coach bollman is the same way
2724 one of the toughest things ive ever done was telling coach tressel i was going to michigan i loved those guys so much and had become so close
2725 i said youre not going to be a mike boren youre a different kind of kid i dont care if you play football or not what i care is if you do it youve got to give 110 percent
2726 but he grew up as a michigan person and responded well to coach carr and his staff
2727 players want to be coached and have somebody take them to a different level than they can take themselves
2728 you think youre giving it your all but your coach knows what you can do and what you can offer
2729 boren got yelled at like everybody else even though his dad played for bo
2730 was it my first choice hell no but i could have gotten acquainted
2731 when i get done with college football ill let it out
2732 my real friends are still my friends there just arent many of them
2733 ill always root for justin but ill never root for ohio state
2734 tressel and his staff coach with class and emphasize education
2735 they put whats most important first each player is important theres no bashing of players youre not going to be belittled each player has feelings they treat each person with respect
2736 he plowed all the way until sunday and then drove back up to michigan
2737 i was hoping rodriguez would keep some of his assistants
2738 as soon as i got my release papers i contacted ohio state and they welcomed me with open arms
2739 attn nfl justin boren is a quitter who could not handle the system
2740 he thrives on that the more michigan boos him the harder hell work
2741 it will be the happiest day of my life its going to be crazy thats what im looking forward to and its all the better its in ann arbor

2746 since the earth has survived massive meteors like the one that created the gulf of mexico massive volcanic eruptions that spewed millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere and incredibly large fires that charred millions and millions of acres and spewed tons of carbon into the atmosphere is man really capable of destroying the planet by burning the oil and coal that is in the planet
2747 is earth going to stay in its extremes or have a steady norm in weather paterns
2748 there have been several periods of either significant warming or cooling over that last couple of thousand years
2749 if she did know she never would have auditioned for him
2750 for me its part of the closure its part of the healing process for us and to come a support the other families who are here families who lost their children
2751 i was in nothing but a bra and panties and wearing these high heels when everything started shaking
2752 i kind of stopped and looked around to see if it was just me if i was the one shaking or if i was just positioned funny
2753 but then i saw the photographer shaking and all the lights shaking
2754 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
2755 since the earth has survived massive meteors like the one that created the gulf of mexico massive volcanic eruptions that spewed millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere and incredibly large fires that charred millions and millions of acres and spewed tons of carbon into the atmosphere is man really capable of destroying the planet by burning the oil and coal that is in the planet

2759 dchhs is actively involved in the investigation of cases of diarrahal illnesses that may be associated with spray parks in dallas county
2760 it became apparent that the board had a there was just a lack of confidence and quite frankly a lack of trust
2761 if the board doesnt trust my motives and doesnt trust my intentions then its time for me to leave
2762 every person in a public position when theyre leaving an organization is offered some amount of severance so its not at all uncommon for this industry or quite rankly for any public industry
2763 you serve for 23 years its within the legal rights of the contract to give her severance pay
2764 i thank the board for their integrity in doing so if you ask me she deserved more
2765 overall id like to think that the families that we serve appreciated the work of the housing authority as a whole and my contribution as a person
2766 i was the one who actually helped her move her stuff out of the church
2767 we are not going to draw the church into this by any means
2768 we want to talk to mcfarlands friends period they truly were probably her second family down there
2769 there reasoning may be they dont have the nationwide sales but we would be able to sell them pretty easily here in utah
2770 i think its kind of stupid because they are good enough to make the team they should make jerseys for everyone whatever the reason
2771 maybe they are just not as well known as others
2772 hold that cable car up there with pride i gotta ride ride ride
2773 this handbook is not about quick and dirty short term fixes to immediate tactical problems it is about long term strategy a strategy for returning america to its progressive ideals all over america progressives are finding their voices we hope this handbook will help you find yours this book is not about winning and losing elections it is about winning and losing hearts and minds
2774 griffin put the car into reverse running over the victim
2775 griffins family is bad shape and mine will never be the same no matter what they do to him frank had police training he knew how to be safe i dont know how he could have gotten into that predicament if i could make it better for either family i would
2776 the defendants actions were outrageous and the charges reflect that
2777 he came in two years ago as to race and he became a friend
2778 i feel sorry for president nixon he must have had a very unhappy childhood why else would he want to bomb all those cambodians
2779 youd like to remember it that way wouldnt you but ill bet you werent all that rational when you were a teenager
2780 yes well i guess that is an unfortunate consequence of doing what is right nevertheless we must stoically push on and continue to do what we believe is right
2781 peaceful agenda conservative as in frugal not wasteful economic policy
2782 informed intelligent beneficient approach to being all that we can be
2783 we came for training i certainly wont but he will for sure
2784 an injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere an injustice to anyone is an injustice to everyone
2785 things are only going to change when theres an alliance of values and of communities
2786 hopefully if its successful well bring in another website and i will be in charge of the mens division
2787 when you say that its very polished its funny because thats my aesthetic also so it blends very well with kink com
2788 im trying to bring in huge porn stars big names and also im trying to discover new talent and were going to mix it all together im getting the muscle boys the porn stars the boy next door the gym boy the leather boy the fetish boy im getting all types of men for the site
2789 these are big time porn stars and i love working with them
2790 but i also love working with tober who has been doing it for so long hes on cruise control so i dont have to do much with him hes got skills and i just let him run with it
2791 chad is a top in vanilla porn so he has that dominant streak inside of him already
2792 all it takes from me is to show him the correct way of using a flog or a belt and to hit safely we have safety lessons before we start thats all it took and he went with it thats my job to bring out the sm and the sadistic side of these tops
2793 theres nothing like it on the web so theyre just starving for this material
2794 id like to make it so that it has something for everyone the vanilla crowd who has never thought of bondage or sm but say you know im not really into that but that looks fucking hot
2795 this is san francisco where all the leather boys are and i want to bring in the leather community and embrace the leather community to be a part of kinkmen com and give me some feedback so it can be something for them also
2796 a place for them to for to and have discussions hopefully i can have meetings here in the armory for the leather community that theyll be happy with
2797 i cant believe that theyre paying me for this i pinch myself every morning because its just like a dream job for me
2798 everybody at kink is extremely supportive and i have total freedom and they support my artistic endeavors
2799 i am so excited about my first film with private as they are the biggest name in adult
2800 i am in every scene of the movie which is quite unusual and also why it is called 100 zuleidy it was great fun to make and i made many new friends i hope to do many more films with private in the future
2801 i dont count all the feathers i just count the number of wings
2802 it was a close family that didnt deserve this end i dont have a blood relationship with this family but we have been close for years
2803 this is the most intricate install that weve ever done no seriously
2804 with manny in the middle of the lineup it will certainly get other peoples attention it is not going to be easy in pitchers minds to get through this lineup
2805 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
2806 he served really well so it was always going to be a hard match
2807 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
2808 i guess ill analyze and assess my game after the us open for the moment its just all a blur i mean its so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard
2809 its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
2810 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
2811 i dont know what to take out of this match
2812 theres always going to be a nothing match these type of matches what are you going to do i just tried to serve well
2813 it wasnt an olympics or a us open so i can live with that
2814 maybe i got a little bit unlucky on a couple but he definitely served well in the last tiebreaker when i had three chances on second serves i wasnt able to get one when i really needed to be on even terms with him
2815 i guess that cost me the match which is hard to accept
2816 hes doing well and i have done well in the past as well
2817 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the us open
2818 i havent played against top 10 players so much in my career so beating one of them gives me more confidence
2819 were right back in it weve just got to go hard again in the morning
2820 i was just chuntering it was just an aimless rant i think i went in to see him afterwards and i apologised it was just emotion i went in and shook his hand and were friends again
2821 yorkers are probably a bit under used at times i tried to slip a few in and it seemed coming out of the committee room windows they struggled to see them
2822 i dont think the light was an issue it was the dark windows above the sightscreen it was really just the yorkers
2823 with the amount of movement there still is off the wicket it makes life tough for the batsmen i think there is going to movement throughout the game
2824 if we can get a hundred ahead hopefully our bowlers can get the ball in the right areas like fred flintoff did
2825 having icc language in the text sends the wrong message to a man who has presided over genocide
2826 it is likely that we will discuss this the deferral request again over the coming months
2827 but the focus now should be on renewing the unamid mandate and showing solid council support for what is a very different mission in the field
2828 we hope this resolution will get the broadest possible support
2829 to pledge and contribute the helicopter aerial reconnaissance ground transport engineering and logistical units and other force enablers required
2830 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
2831 theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
2832 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
2833 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
2834 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
2835 we think the tenor of his campaign is unlikely to change that is what he is offering voters increasingly harsh character attacks personal attacks while people are out there struggling every day
2836 i think voters did expect different from john mccain it is clear what they are going to be offering the american people over the next 96 days selling voters short
2837 if you came out here with us youd see that we have supportive crowds who really ask us about the issues
2838 when the wintu goes up the river the hills are to the west the river to the east and a mosquito bites him on the west arm when he returns the hills are still to the west but when he scratches his mosquito bite he scratches his east arm
2839 design is a waste of time we have a really ugly site
2840 we are not worried about the design well outsource it or use a free wordpress theme let us focus more on the product
2841 this is almost like once you accuse someone of racism and bigotry the facts become irrelevant
2842 i think that they played the race card on me and we now know from memos from the campaign and everything that they planned to do it all along i was stating a fact and its still a fact
2843 would use his race to scare up votes for john mccain
2844 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
2845 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black hes got a feisty wife
2846 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
2847 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
2848 it seems clear therefore that the race card has become a permanent part of obamas hand a wild card to be played whenever the spirit or the circumstances so moves him
2849 itll not only tell them the rating but it will pull of the data that went into it what were the taks passing rates what were the middle school dropout rates what where the high school completion rates
2850 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
2851 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
2852 the olympiad cycle was a very simple four year cycle and you dont need a sophisticated instrument like this to calculate it it took us by huge surprise when we saw this
2853 but the games were of such cultural and social importance that its not unnatural to have it in the mechanism
2854 as we continue to refine our search algorithms to deliver more relevant results we strive to be as open as possible about how we use data to improve your search experience
2855 this new feature doesnt change anything at all about how you search on google and the results you get it just gives you more of a behind the scenes look at how we customize your search experience
2856 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2857 i think they should probably be a little less paranoid about parsing every word we say and a little more focused on actually addressing the challenges that americans expect the president of the united states to take on
2858 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
2859 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
2860 we werent suggesting in any way he was using race as an issue
2861 its ridiculous its offensive and you have to wonder if there is a double motive for it
2862 we are compelled to respond tomorrow if he does not do it again we will not talk about it again
2863 for a guy who has actually been the victim of attacks like this with his daughter in south carolina thats unacceptable
2864 i believe the mccain camp recognizes they need to define obama and knock him on his heels every single day
2865 its the first time in a while and he doesnt like it
2866 these are the politics of nixon and atwater its transparent its indecent and its most of all its a sign of desperation
2867 i assume this is what passes for cleverness in the hapless mccain campaign that they think somehow it seems less racist to call obama a racist
2868 the only way he gets to that inject race into the campaign
2869 this is the first time in a generation that the council has considered building homes which marks a major shift in strategy and defining council housing in the 21st century
2870 i hope the people of edinburgh will be reassured that their council is responding to the obvious difficulties many of them face in finding a home

2872 you said that negotiating with iran is pointless and then you went further you said that it was appeasement were you referring to senator barack obama
2873 you know my policies of hyper partisanship hypocrisy and lying my a off in public havent changed but evidently the political calendar has people need to read the speech you didnt get it exactly right either what i when i said that a dictatorship would be a hell of a lot easier as long as i was the dictator and when you know a leader of iran says that they want to destroy israel youve got to take those words seriously or when a leader of the most powerful nation in the world says ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office and if you dont take them seriously then it harkens back to a day when we didnt take other words seriously it was fitting that i talked about not taking the words of adolf hitler seriously on the floor of the knesset but i also talked about the need to defend israel the need to not negotiate with the likes of al qaeda hezbollah and hamas and the need to make sure iran doesnt get a nuclear weapon
2874 as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
2875 repeatedly youve talked about iran and that you dont want to see iran develop a nuclear weapon how far away do you think iran is from developing a nuclear capability
2876 you know richard i dont want to speculate and theres a lot of speculation iraq and mushroom clouds appearing above american cities in forty five minutes but one thing is for certain we need to prevent them from learning how to enrich uranium and i have made it clear to the iranians that there is a seat at the table for them if they would verifiably suspend their enrichment and if not well continue to rally the world to isolate them
2877 we should mention we didnt just wake up on a monday morning and say lets call this a civil war

2884 express opposition for the subterranean alley vacation proposed by conner homes in the junction
2885 the project will impact our ability to do business and will have severe negative economic effets on the businesses in the junction area this impact will be compounded by inhibiting the use of the alley during the proposed construction during this time we will not be able to access parking freely at the rear of the business along the alley way there will be the impact of not having the ability for customers to load and unload in the alley way and access the businesses this also will make it very difficult for deliveries to take place during the construction these daily deliveries are vital to sustaining the business along the alley way
2886 if conner does this itll be the end of the businesses that will be the noose it will kill us
2887 the fire department even told us to paint our address numbers on the alley side because thats their first line of response
2888 this project has for the most part flown under the radar
2889 community input is vital for creating development that complements and is considerate of our community
2890 the korean war was hard fought and a great sacrifice
2891 it is often said a nations greatest treasure are its youth
2892 we commit our youth every time we commit ourselves to war many of that great population of youth perished
2893 it is hard to explain the emotion of the people i was privileged to spend time with to listen to their stories to listen to their understanding of what occurred over there
2894 today we are turning over control of most of the combat forces and most of the combat responsibilities to the south koreans
2895 we are moving from the dmz as a nation to south of the han river its the right thing to do south korea is ready to stand up
2896 i bet theyre just regular graphs with some brass doodads tacked on
2897 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point
2898 youve got to do whats right for the team i guess its the right move for the team hopefully it is
2899 i am now really looking forward to the football matches in our home city
2900 we are in the final phase of our preparation and we will enter the olympic tournament in top form
2901 goal scoring remains a problem for our team as we squander too many chances
2902 i hope we can find our goal scoring touch by the time the games begin
2903 i stay put in my position as opposed to running around as much as i did when i first started playing at the age of 17 that is what i have learned to maintain my position and play more with my head
2904 ive mostly played as a central midfielder but i was positioned as centreback several times at osasuna ive adapted well to that position and feel very comfortable
2905 i had the chance to play in some games when i was here last time but a player needs to enjoy some continuity and know that the coach counts on him even when a game doesnt turn out well
2906 i feel ready to play on this team and to have some continuity im here to make decisions hard for the coach

2911 as we mourn his passing so too should we reflect on his contributions to our national security of the thousands of lives he guided the careers he mentored the difference he made simply by virtue of his leadership
2912 we are a stronger more capable military today in large part because of his efforts to make us so he will be missed

3041 i propose today to prove to you that all this organized and vast criminality springs from what i may be allowed to call a crime against the spirit i mean a doctrine that by denying all spiritual rational or moral values by which nations have tried for thousands of years to improve human conditions aims to plunge humanity back into barbarism no longer the natural and spontaneous barbarism of primitive nations but into a diabolical barbarism conscious of itself and using for its ends all material means put at the disposal of humanity by contemporary science this sin against the spirit is the original sin of national socialism from which all crimes spring this monstrous doctrine is that of racism whether we consider a crime against peace or war crimes we are therefore not faced by an accidental or an occasional criminality that events could explain without justifying it we are in fact faced by systematic criminality which derives directly and of necessity from a monstrous doctrine put into practice with deliberate intent by the masters of nazi germany
3042 a natural consequence of the national socialist doctrine for which man has no intrinsic value unless he serves the german race
3043 the deportation enslavement or mass scale and systematic practice of summary executions abduction of persons following their disappearance torture or inhuman acts inspired by political philosophical racial or religious motives and organized for the purpose of implementing a concerted effort against a civilian population group

3052 the fact that so many people swallowed the great terror hook line and sinker was probably one of the reasons that the terror succeeded so well in particular the trials would not be so significant had they not received the blessing of some independent foreign commentators these pundits should be held accountable as accomplices in the bloody politics of the purges or at least blamed for the fact that the political assassinations resumed when the first show trial regarding zinoviev in 1936 was given an ill deserved stamp of approval
3053 that the rage and wrath of the masses must be inflamed against them they must be destroyed as a class because they are accursed
3054 to massacre them it was necessary to proclaim that kulaks are not human beings just as the germans proclaimed that jews are not human beings thus did lenin and stalin say kulaks are not human beings
3055 that is exactly how the nazis put the jewish children into the nazi gas chambers you are not allowed to live you are all jews
3056 who has given you the authority to say what is good and what is bad

3058 communism teaches and seeks two objectives unrelenting class warfare and the complete eradication of private ownership not secretly or by hidden methods does it do this but publicly openly and by employing any means possible even the most violent to achieve these objectives there is nothing it is afraid to do nothing for which it has respect or reverence when it comes to power it is ferocious in its cruelty and inhumanity the horrible slaughter and destruction through which it has laid waste to vast regions of eastern europe and asia give evidence of this
3059 when in the silence of abjection no sound can be heard save that of the chains of the slave and the voice of the informer when all tremble before the tyrant and it is as dangerous to incur his favor as to merit his displeasure the historian appears entrusted with the vengeance of the people

3067 the terror was government by fear which robespierre theorized as government by virtue invented to destroy the aristocracy it soon became the means to dispose of the wicked and to combat crime it became an integral part of revolution and appeared to be the only means of forming the future citizens of the republic if the republic of free citizens was not yet a possibility it must be because certain individuals corrupted by their past history were not yet pure enough terror became the means by which revolution the history yet to be created would forge the new human beings of the future
3068 to punish the enemies of the fatherland we must find out who they are but we do not want to punish them we want to destroy them
3069 a man who is already lost he has no particular interest no private business no feelings no personal attachments and no property he does not even have a name everything in him is absorbed by one interest to the exclusion of all others by a single thought a single passion revolution in the depths of his being not simply in words but in his actions as well he has broken all links with society and the world of civilization with its laws and conventions with its social etiquette and its moral code the revolutionary is an implacable enemy and he carries on living only so that he can ensure the destruction of society
3070 the revolutionary never enters the political or social world the so called educated world and he lives with faith only in its swift and total destruction no one who feels pity for anything can truly be called a revolutionary
3071 this whole sick society must be divided into several categories in the first category are the people who are to be killed immediately the second should include individuals who are to be allowed to continue living for a while so that by their monstrous acts they merely accelerate the inevitable uprising of the people
3072 a fantasy reenactment of the french revolution that was the beginning of political terrorism as opposed to isolated acts of assassination as a systematic tactic in the modern world thus the populist strategy of mass insurrection from below in conjunction with that of elite terror from above combined in russia to lend further legitimacy to political violence over and above the initial legitimation provided by the western revolutionary tradition from 1789 to 1871
3073 this country in its unparalleled misfortune remains an enigma for students of its history in trying to shed light on the underlying causes of this age old tragedy a specific and always damaging link has emerged between the seizure or maintenance of power and the practice of political murder be it individual or mass real or symbolic this long tradition of murder has doubtless created a collective consciousness that has little hope for a pacified political world
3074 this act as the following century showed was more genuinely revolutionary than the october revolution emancipation shook the millennial foundations of russian life as neither peter nor lenin could shake them the subjection of progress to slavery
3075 the russians including the bolsheviks are all sons of tsarism this has been their culture and their education for centuries they got rid of the tsar but they cannot get rid of tsarism overnight they still wear the uniform of tsarism even if it is back to front the bolsheviks were not ready for a positive administrative revolution what they wanted was a negative revolution whose doctrinal fanaticism meanness of spirit and general lack of culture they could use as a pretext for any number of acts of destruction one thing i hold against them above all is the pleasure they took in murder just like the tsars before them
3076 cruelty has stupefied and tormented me all my life what are the roots of human cruelty i have thought much about this and i still do not understand it in the slightest but now after the terrible madness of the european war and the bloody events of the revolution i am forced to remark that russian cruelty appears not to have evolved at all its forms have remained the same a chronicler from the turn of the seventeenth century recorded that in his day the following tortures were practiced the mouth was filled with gunpowder and then set alight others have their nether regions filled with powder holes were made in womens breasts and ropes passed through the wounds and the women were suspended by the ropes in 1918 and 1919 the same practices were used in the don and the urals men had dynamite placed in their rear and blown up i think the russians have a unique sense of particular cruelty in the same way that the english have a unique sense of humor a cold sort of cruelty that seeks to explore the limits of human resistance to suffering and to study the persistence and stability of life one can sense a diabolical refinement in russian cruelty there is something quite subtle and refined about it this quality cannot fully be explained by words like psychosis or sadism words that in essence explain nothing at all if such acts of cruelty were the expression of the perverse psychology of a few individuals they would not concern us here they would be material for the psychiatrist rather than for the moralist but i am concerned here with human suffering as a collective entertainment who are the more cruel the whites or the reds they are probably equal as they are both russians in any case history answers quite clearly the most cruel is the most active
3077 the burden of aeschylus oresteia is that crime begets crime and violence violence until the first crime in the chain the original sin of the genus is expiated through accumulated suffering in similar fashion it was the blood of august 1914 acting like some curse of the atreidae on the house of modern europe that generated the chain of international and social violence that has dominated the modern age for the violence and carnage of the war were incommensurate with any conceivable gain and for any party the war itself produced the russian revolution and the bolshevik seizure of power
3078 the real cause of the change into a development toward brutality is attributable to the world war when therefore the war broke out and dragged in its train for four years practically the whole of the healthy male population the coarsening tendencies of militarism sank to the very depths of brutality and to a lack of human feeling and sentiment even the proletariat could no longer escape its influence they were to a very high degree infected by militarism and when they returned home again were in every way brutalized habituated to war the man who had come back from the front was only too often in a state of mind and feeling that made him ready even in peacetime and among his own people to enforce his claims and interests by deeds of violence and bloodshed that became as it were an element of the civil war
3079 war is waged by regimented civilian masses who have gone from the autonomy of citizenship to military obedience for a time of unknown duration and who are plunged into a raging inferno where staying alive rather than being intelligent or courageous is the main objective and where even victory is a distant abstraction military service can rarely have seemed less noble than it did to the millions of men plucked from civilian life and trapped in the trenches war is the political state furthest removed from normal civilian life it is a purely instinctive business totally removed from other interests and intellectual pursuits an army at war is a social order in which individuals no longer exist and whose inhumanity creates a sort of inertia that is almost impossible to break
3080 from the first day of their coming into power having proclaimed the abolition of the death penalty the bolsheviks began to kill they killed prisoners captured in the battles of the civil war they killed enemies who surrendered on the condition that their lives would be spared these wholesale murders organized at the instigation of the bolsheviks were followed by murders at the direct behest of the bolshevik government having assassinated tens of thousands of men without trial the bolsheviks started their executions by verdicts of the courts they established a supreme revolutionary tribunal to convict enemies of the soviet regime the beast has licked hot human blood the man killing machine is brought into motion messrs medvedev bruno peterson veselovsky and karelin the judges of the supreme revolutionary tribunal have turned up their sleeves and set to work as butchers but blood breeds blood the reign of terror established by the bolsheviks since october 1917 has filled the air of russian fields with vapors of human blood we witness the growth of the bitterness of the civil war the growing bestiality of men engaged in it the great principles of true humanity that formed the basis of socialist teachings have sunk into oblivion
3081 you came to us to cultivate our ancestral barbarism long nurtured by the tsars and to place offerings on the antique russian altar to murder to elevate disdain for the life of others to a degree the like of which has never been seen you came to bring the rule of the executioners throughout the country the executioner is now again the chief figure in russia
3082 for me the richness of a country the power of a people is to be measured by the quantity and quality of its intellectual development revolution is a useful enterprise only if it favors such development scholars should be treated with care and respect but in trying to save our own skins we are decapitating the people destroying our own brain
3083 we would be wrong to equate the intellectual strength of the people with the strength of the bourgeois intelligentsia the intellectual strength of workers and peasants grows in the struggle to overturn the bourgeoisie and their acolytes those second rate intellectuals and lackeys of capitalism who think they are the brain of the nation they are not the brain of the nation theyre shit
3084 it is quite clear that if our problem is the abolition of private property in the means of production the only road to its solution lies through the concentration of state power in its entirety in the hands of the proletariat and the setting up for the transitional period of an extraordinary regime dictatorship is necessary because this is a case not of partial changes but of the very existence of the bourgeoisie no agreement is possible on this basis only force can be the deciding factor whoever aims at the end cannot reject the means
3085 in no case need we anticipate that in western europe the course of the great french revolution will be repeated if present day russia exhibits so much likeness to the france of 1793 this shows only how near it stands to the stage of middle class revolution
3086 if there is one true theory in history if there is a rationality at work in things then it is clear that its development should be entrusted to specialists in that theory and technicians of that particular rationale the absolute power of the party has a philosophical status its foundation is a function of the materialist conception of history if that concept is true power should be absolute and democracy is a concession to the human fallibility of the leaders or a pedagogical procedure that they alone can measure out in the correct dosages
3087 vladimir ilich affirmed yesterday that the proletariat as a class in the marxist sense does not exist in russia allow me to congratulate you for managing to exercise dictatorship on behalf of a class that does not actually exist
3088 the antagonism of the two socialist movements is the clashing of two fundamentally distinct methods that of democracy and that of dictatorship both movements have the same end in view to free the proletariat and with it humanity through socialism but the view taken by one is held by the other to be erroneous and likely to lead to destruction we place ourselves of course by asking for the fullest discussion firmly on the side of democracy dictatorship does not ask for the refutation of contrary views but the forcible suppression of their utterance thus the two methods of democracy and dictatorship are already irreconcilably opposed before the discussion has started the one demands the other forbids it
3089 a minority dictatorship always finds its most powerful support in an obedient army but the more it substitutes this for majority support the more it drives the opposition to seek a remedy by an appeal to the bayonet instead of an appeal to the vote that is denied them civil war becomes a method of adjusting political and social antagonisms where complete political and social apathy or dejection does not prevail the minority dictatorship is always threatened by armed attack or constant guerrilla warfare the dictatorship is then involved in civil war and lives in constant danger of being overthrown there is no greater obstacle to the building of a socialist society than internal war in a civil war each party fights for its existence and the vanquished are threatened with complete destruction the consciousness of this fact is why civil wars are so terrible
3090 in reality the state is nothing but a machine for the suppression of one class by another
3091 dictatorship is rule based directly on force and unrestricted by any laws the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is rule won and maintained through the use of violence by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie rule that is unrestricted by any laws
3092 proletarian democracy of which soviet government is one of the forms has brought a development and expansion of democracy hitherto unprecedented in the world precisely for the vast majority of the population for the exploited and toiling people
3093 kautsky sees one of the reasons for the extremely bloody character of the revolution in the war and in its hardening influence on manners
3094 the development of bourgeois society itself out of which contemporary democracy grew in no way represents the process of gradual democratization that figured before the war in the dreams of the greatest socialist illusionist of democracy jean jaures and now in those of the most learned of pedants karl kautsky
3095 two forces the revolutionary proletariat under the leadership of the communists and counterrevolutionary democracy headed by generals and admirals
3096 it could and must be explained that in the civil war we destroyed white guards so that they would not destroy the workers consequently our problem is not the destruction of human life but its preservation the enemy must be made harmless and in wartime this means that he must be destroyed the problem of revolution as of war lies in breaking the will of the foe forcing him to capitulate and to accept the conditions of the conqueror the question about who will rule the country that is about the life or death of the bourgeoisie will be decided on either side not by reference to the paragraphs of the constitution but by the employment of all forms of violence
3097 during war all institutions and organs of the state and of public opinion become directly or indirectly weapons of war this is particularly true of the press no government waging a serious war will allow publications to exist on its territory that openly or indirectly support the enemy still more so in a civil war the nature of the latter is such that each of the struggling sides has in the rear of its armies considerable circles of the population who support the enemy in war where both success and failure are repaid by death hostile agents who penetrate into the rear are subject to execution this is inhumane but no one ever considered war or all the more civil war to be a school of humanity
3098 the overturning of the old world and its replacement by a new life in which the same old evils are kept in place a life that is contaminated by the same old principles means that socialism is forced to make a crucial choice during the decisive struggle about whether to use the old fashioned violence of the tsars and the bourgeoisie or to resort instead to revolutionary violence old fashioned violence is merely a protection against slavery while the new violence is the painful path toward emancipation that is what should be decisive in our choice we should take violence into our own hands to be sure that we bring about the end of violence for there is no other means of fighting against it such is the gaping moral wound of the revolution therein lies the central paradox the contradiction that will be the inevitable source of much conflict and suffering
3099 like terror violence considered both as a means of constraint and as deception will always contaminate the soul of the conquered first before affecting the victor and the rest of society
3100 i have not the slightest desire to return to russia i would not be able to write a thing if i had to spend the whole time returning to the theme of thou shalt not kill time and again
3101 it seems to me rolland that you would judge events inside the soviet union more evenhandedly if you admitted one simple fact that the soviet regime together with the avant garde of the workers is locked in a civil war which takes the form of a class war
3102 the basis of our activity should be simple ideals like truth honesty and trust among revolutionary brothers lying cheating mystification and of necessity violence should be employed only against the enemy whereas you my friend and this is where you are most gravely mistaken you have fallen under the spell of the systems of loyola and machiavelli you are enamored of police tactics and jesuitical methods and you are using such ideas to run your organization so you end up treating your own friends as though they were enemies
3103 i am so happy that they have been shot like dogs
3104 the enemy is the great justification for terror and the totalitarian state needs enemies to survive if it lacks them it invents them once they have been identified they are treated without mercy being an enemy is a hereditary stain that cannot be removed as has often been pointed out jews are persecuted not for what they have done but for what they are and communism is no different it demands the repression or in moments of crisis the elimination of the bourgeoisie as a class belonging to the class is enough there is no need actually to have done anything at all
3105 it was scientism and not humanism that helped establish the ideological bases of totalitarianism the relation between scientism and totalitarianism is not limited to the justification of acts through so called scientific necessity biological or historical one must already be a practitioner of scientism even if it is wild scientism to believe in the perfect transparency of society and thus in the possibility of transforming society by revolutionary means to conform with an ideal
3106 the violent revolution has become a necessity precisely because the imminent requirements of history are unable to find a road through the apparatus of parliamentary democracy
3107 the proletariat is the historically rising class the bourgeoisie by contrast today is a falling class it no longer plays an essential part in production and by its imperialist methods of appropriation is destroying the economic structure of the world and human culture generally nevertheless the historical tenacity of the bourgeoisie is colossal it holds to power and does not wish to abandon it it thereby threatens to drag after it into the abyss the whole of society we are forced to tear off this class and chop it away the red terror is a weapon used against a class that despite being doomed to destruction does not wish to perish
3108 against us is a whole outmoded society that has had its day and that should allow us to think of ourselves as still being in a civil war so quite naturally we can conclude that if the enemies do not surrender it is up to us to exterminate them
3109 the blue eyes of the revolution burn with cruel necessity
3110 to be exact however our goal is not socialism as such which is the abolition of every kind of exploitation and oppression be it directed against a class a party a sex or a race should it be proved to us that somehow the emancipation of the proletariat and of humanity could be achieved solely on the basis of private property we would discard socialism without in any way giving up our objective on the contrary this would be conducive to our objective
3111 the barbarian ritual of the purge and the idea of the extermination machine in top gear are closely linked in the discourse and practice of persecution to the animalization of the other to the reduction of real or imaginary enemies to a zoological state
3112 shoot these rabid dogs death to this gang who hide their ferocious teeth their eagle claws from the people down with that vulture trotsky from whose mouth a bloody venom drips putrefying the great ideals of marxism lets put these liars out of harms way these miserable pygmies who dance around rotting carcasses down with these abject animals lets put an end once and for all to these miserable hybrids of foxes and pigs these stinking corpses let their horrible squeals finally come to an end lets exterminate the mad dogs of capitalism who want to tear to pieces the flower of our new soviet nation lets push the bestial hatred they bear our leaders back down their own throats
3113 in my opinion the execution was entirely legitimate it is quite natural that a worker and peasant regime should stamp out its enemies like lice
3114 as always the poets and butchers of totalitarianism reveal themselves first of all by the vocabulary they use the liquidation of the muscovite executioners a close relative of the treatment carried out by the nazi assassins is a linguistic microcosm of an irreparable mental and cultural catastrophe that was in full view on the soviet stage the value of human life collapsed and thinking in categories enemies of the people traitors untrustworthy elements etc replaced ethical thought in the discourse and practice of the nazi exterminators the animalization of the other which could not be dissociated from the obsession with cleanliness and contagion was closely linked to the ideology of race it was conceived in the implacably hierarchical racial terms of subhumans and supermen but in moscow in 1937 the discourse about race and the totalitarian measures associated with it were quite different what mattered instead was the total animalization of the other so that a policy under which absolutely anything was possible could come into practice
3115 class hatred should be cultivated by an organic revulsion as far as the enemy is concerned enemies must be seen as inferior i believe quite profoundly that the enemy is our inferior and is a degenerate not only on the physical plane but also in the moral sense
3116 the time is nearing when science will imperiously address normal people and say would you like all diseases handicaps imperfections senility and premature death of the organism to be studied minutely and precisely such study cannot be carried out solely with experiments on dogs rabbits and guinea pigs experiments on human beings are indispensable for what must be studied are the human mechanisms of the functioning of the organism intracellular processes hematopoiesis neurochemistry and all the processes that go on inside the organism hundreds of human guinea pigs are required this will be a true service to humanity which will be far more important and useful than the extermination of tens of millions of healthy beings for the comfort of a miserable physically psychologically and morally degenerate class of predators and parasites
3117 legal texts about bioethics act as signposts about some of the more insidious threats linked to the progress of science whose role in the birth of ideologies linked to terror j ashers law of the movement has yet to be fully recognized the fundamentally eugenic thrust of work by well known doctors such as charles richet and alexis carrel clearly paved the way for nazi extermination and the wayward actions of nazi doctors
3118 as master of the knowledge of the evolution of social species lenin decided who should disappear by virtue of having been condemned to the dustbin of history
3119 classifications segregation exclusions and purely biological criteria that are brought in by this criminal ideology we are thinking of scientific ideas heredity hybridization racial purity and the fantastic millenarian or apocalyptic aspects that are clearly also the product of a particular historical moment
3120 recognize that the notion of humanity extends beyond the biological approach and that biology has little to say about the human person
3121 it is true that it is perfectly possible to consider the human species an animal species like any other a species that man is learning to make himself as he already makes other animal and vegetable species
3122 this sort of person behaves among other people as a surgeon does in the wards of a hospital his soul is really in his knife and the essence of these people lies in their fanatical faith in the surgeons knife the surgeons knife that is the great theoretician the archphilosopher of the twentieth century
3123 our people are not a blank sheet of paper on which any secret society can write whatever it wants like your communist program for instance
3124 do you remember how angry with me you became when i called you an abrek and described your beliefs as a sort of abreki catechism you said that all men should be made so and that the abandonment of the self and the renunciation of personal needs and desires all feelings attachments and links should be a normal state the everyday condition of all humanity out of that cruel renunciation and extreme fanaticism you now want to make a general principle applicable to the whole community you want crazy things impossible things the total negation of nature man and society
3125 the purpose is not to torture or to burn the victim the aim is to ask the right question no terror without truth which is its foundation without truth how can error be recognized if one is certain that one possesses the truth how can one leave ones neighbor in error
3126 the idea that the world we see is so totally corrupt that it is beyond improvement and that accordingly the world that will follow will bring plenitude perfection and ultimate liberation is one of the most monstrous aberrations of the human spirit of course this aberration is not an invention of our own time but we should recognize that religious thought which opposes all temporal values to the force of supernatural grace is much less abominable than doctrines that tell us we can assure our salvation by jumping from the edge of the abyss to the glorious heights of the heavens
3127 the memory of the terror weighed on peoples minds no one could believe that stalin had really gone for good there was scarcely a family in moscow that had not suffered in some way from persecution yet no one ever talked about it i for instance would never talk about my experiences in the camps in front of my friends and they never asked about it the fear was too deep rooted in everyones minds
3128 one of my old friends a worker from sormov a kind hearted man complained that it was hard to work for the cheka
3129 our century is the century of the greatest violence ever committed against human beings by the state but it is precisely here that the strength and hope of humanity lie it is the twentieth century that has at last shaken the hegelian concept of the historical process whereby everything real is rational it was this concept violently debated for decades that russian thinkers of the past century finally accepted but now at the height of the states triumph over individual freedom russian thinkers wearing padded camp jackets have dethroned and cast down the old hegelian law and proclaimed their new supreme guiding principle of world history everything inhuman is senseless and worthless amid the total triumph of inhumanity it has become self evident that everything effected by violence is senseless and worthless and that it has no future and will disappear without a trace
3130 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point

3146 dylan is so brilliant to me he makes william shakespeare look like billy joel
3147 if you look through what has been written about bob dylan in the past thirty odd years you notice a desire for him to die off so that his younger self can assume its mythic place
3148 i love bob dylan i really do i love his early work i love the first time he plugged in electrically i love his christian albums i love his other albums
3149 it wouldnt be fair if i didnt name every dylan record it almost makes me furious sometimes how good his lyrics are you know you aspire to things im trying and trying to write a song and ill get something and ill say thats pretty good and then ill listen to blood on the tracks and think who the hell am i kidding what the hell am i talking about come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm asshole
3150 overall dylans probably my favorite of everyone the basement tapes are something i cant get enough of and all the unoffical unreleased basement tapes too desire is one of my favorite records of all time
3151 dylan is a complex mercurial human being of astounding gifts whose purposes are usually ambiguous frequently elusive and sometimes downright unguessable at the same time he is a sort of communicating vessel open to currents that run up and down the ages quite outside the confines of the popular culture of any given period

3188 google chose to sign this agreement with tele atlas because they like our data and our innovative business practices

3209 mira l es un jugador muy peligroso cuando se da la vuelta es un jugador que pone muy buenos pases entonces en ese sentido lo que se necesita es no dejarlo dar vuelta y estar muy cerca de l nada m s con eso pone buenos pases y es muy inteligente para jugar
3210 s por ah cuando no le sale la jugada o cuando le metes un poco la patita se molesta entonces habr que meterle un poquito la patita
3211 todos sabemos que es un jugador muy temperamental en ese sentido ustedes lo dijeron cuando no le salen las cosas se desespera igual por si ven seguido cuando se le mete la pierna un poquito se enoja

3226 ellos est n en ese proceso de cambiar de estilo a un 4 4 2 m s a la colombiana si nos acordamos honduras era un equipo que acostumbraba a tirar la pelota larga a sus delanteros que normalmente son r pidos y buscaban chocar para en velocidad superarte ahora son un equipo que juega diferente buscan salir jugando hasta que se encuentran los espacios
3227 con ellos est turcios aquel que jugara en tecos de le n que est en italia suazo en general tienen 7 u 8 jugadores jugando en europa por lo que no van a ser f ciles pero ya les detectamos algunas debilidades que obviamente no te las puedo comentar pero en su momento las sabr n
3228 la verdad que muy contento y sorprendido la verdad que no esperaba el llamado si bien uno siempre est trabajando con aspiraci n y el objetivo de alg n momento de estar en la selecci n hoy s me toma de sorpresa pero contento y motivado hay que esperar y seguir haciendo bien las cosas aqu en el club y reportarnos con muchas ganas y con mucha actitud sobre todo de aportar
3229 no lo esperaba aunque siempre me dedico al trabajo la aspiraci n es estar trabajando pesando en llegar un d a a la selecci n pasando primero por buenos resultados en tu club y ahorita la sorpresa ah est porque me acabo de enterar por medio de sus cuestionamientos lo que menos me esperaba era que me preguntaran eso y pues es una motivaci n extra en el trabajo individual
3230 totalmente de acuerdo es el trabajo y si nos conformamos simplemente con un llamado o con aparecer ahorita estamos muy equivocados vamos a mantenernos hay compa eros que lo han hecho muy bien hay muy buena base buena escuela con qui n respaldarnos y empaparnos muy r pido de lo que es el trabajo en la selecci n para que sea el primero de muchos llamados
3231 es trabajar entregarte no hay que relajarnos ni mucho menos ni echar las campanas al vuelo se puede ver con la filosof a de que no he logrado absolutamente nada el trabajo tiene que seguir reflej ndose tanto en toluca como en la selecci n y con cada entrenamiento
3232 estoy muy contento siempre es un honor y un privilegio entrar en los planes de la selecci n sobre todo ahora por ser tomado en cuenta desde un principio por el nuevo t cnico nacional portar la playera verde siempre me va a dar alegr a y esta vez no es la excepci n
3233 leandro es mexicano y mientras tanto puede vestir la playera de la selecci n si ayuda y defiende los colores de nuestro pa s es bienvenido a lo largo del tiempo que ha jugado con su equipo pumas ha demostrado de su gran capacidad y la gran calidad que tiene dentro de la cancha lo nico que puedo decir es que esperemos que aporte mucho en nuestra selecci n
3234 esas decisiones las toma el t cnico yo estoy para trabajar y cumplir con las rdenes del entrenador obviamente que mi deseo es jugar desde el primer compromiso por que para eso trabajo d a a d a con el equipo sin embargo hay que ir paso a paso y aprovechar este llamado para conocer al nuevo entrenador y posteriormente ser tomado en cuenta con frecuencia

3237 an unprecedented expansion of epa authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land
3238 epa was responsive to these petitions in our advanced notice of proposed rulemaking and we are moving ahead with that process
3239 how are three people going to travel on only one ticket
3240 i know what mary will say now shell say dope users are sick and we should just understand
3241 we believed in slavery for 18 and a half centuries before we came to know gods will for us with respect to people of colour
3242 it has been more painful than i thought it might be
3243 ive felt the exclusion profoundly i understand thats just the way it has to be but its a very odd and difficult feeling to have been separated from your own house of bishops by an external force
3244 as a constant and steady reminder that every bishop in the anglican communion has gay and lesbian people in their diocese whether they know it or not whether they know who they are or not whether it homosexuality is legal or not
3245 i dont consider them enemies at all and its no surprise to me that people who live in contexts very different from our own in the united states see this problem very differently
3246 its no surprise that many of these bishops and people in these countries where homosexuality is publishable sometimes by imprisonment have not had the experience we have had in the american church which is of faithful lesbian and gay people in the pews making themselves known to us and our having to grapple with that issue
3247 that doesnt mean i dont believe we shouldnt be changing those attitudes
3248 resist the push by those who are not here to try and settle this once and for all because in the end i think we will come to regret our rejection of gay and lesbian people the way we have come to regret our support for slavery and our virtual rejection of women
3249 the beauty of anglicanism is that it has been a big umbrella under which we can disagree about many things so long as we agree on the essentials
3250 i would plead for a continuation of that great tradition in which we hold together and we continue to be the church despite our differences on this issue because i dont think it rises to the level of being an essential
3251 you dont hear anyone on the side of those who would argue for greater inclusion of gay and lesbian people argue that anyone else has to leave no one is saying that the conservatives within the communion should leave because they dont understand the will of god
3252 that is what you hear coming from the other side and the difficulty of course is that you cant make anyone stay i would make a plea for our holding together while we live in this tension for a while
3253 we have no parishes threatening to break away i might even say its the one diocese in the whole of the anglican communion that doesnt deal with this issue at all

3280 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
3281 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
3282 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
3283 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars

3290 we still havent located martinez but i sure would like to
3291 we had two lucky members that didnt have to go through the election process
3292 what that tells me is weve got a great bunch of athletes here
3293 attendance is important not only for the students but also for our faculty and staff and everyone is having to take a long hard look at ways to cut energy costs
3294 they have all been very respectful but we wont let our guard down
3295 im very pleased with the response of boaz and guntersville detectives without being asked
3296 the easy part was capturing them now the difficult part of putting everything together has begun
3297 immediately following the initial investigation and searches on tuesday we had reason to believe there was a third weapon and some additional money hidden by one of the robbers in an area of extremely dense woods and brush
3298 wednesday with the assistance of k 9 officer john thompsons canine partner bok we were able to locate the weapon a nickel plated saturday night special 22 pistol the money and a mask which he did a pretty good job of hiding
3299 in an area not exactly where we thought it was in the initial search
3300 the waist high brush and grass were so thick we literally had to step on it to find it
3301 we will be placing letters of commendation in the personnel files of all the albertville officers and dispatcher
3302 we are sending out thank you letters to all the other departments involved i want to also offer our sincere gratitude for all the citizens who helped in providing valuable information during the search for the robbers
3303 i dont care where you put it i just want our share
3304 we are not asking for a lot of outlandish things were only asking for what we need
3305 is an officers safety and efficiency issue for public safety
3306 if you are on the southern part of the county you have to switch to marshall county south frequency and if on the north to the marshall county north frequency
3307 with a new system our dispatcher would not be sitting there flipping frequencies attempting to find out where our deputies are at and the deputies would not be flipping frequencies trying to find the best signal it cuts down on time and is done automatically
3308 it is an issue i have been dealing with since i took office
3309 we are trying to cover our costs from last year we were unable to hire three new employees last year and we want to do that this year it is important we do that
3310 we are attempting to maintain a full staff and to maintain our transport van that has over 300 000 miles on it for transporting prisoners rather than using three patrol units and tying up three deputies and at the same time save fuel
3311 with fuel cost increases we know money is tight i have been very honest about what we need and not asked for unnecessary things just level funding for each area
3312 its the commissions choice financing is not my responsibility i have to have money to run the department but they are the ones under the law who have to make the decisions how it is dispersed
3313 what the decision boils down to is we can spend money on maintenance or we can buy some new patrol cars to replace our aging fleet and keep this process going so we dont get in a hole with high mileage cars
3314 i think it is important we maintain good new if possible equipment so we can respond to our communitys calls
3315 all our budgets will balance by the end of the fiscal year

3326 not true and i have an attorney generals opinion to back it up
3327 i didnt want that to be an issue since im retiring
3328 could not vote on anything pertaining to the school system
3329 i think that may be what he actually thinks but i was very careful to get an opinion from the state on that
3330 i know thats not the only reason theyre running but thats a real poor reason to be running because there are many many many issues other than the schools
3331 i feel like its been an advantage with me knowing what i know about the schools especially with the construction and planning for the high school
3332 i have been able to provide insight into some things we might have missed had i not been in on those discussions
3333 i could vote on the bond issues and anything to do with the school tax i was free to discuss all that i just cant vote on school board members
3334 i have been wrestling with the decision for a couple of years
3335 my husbands been retired five years i just decided it was time i was told several years ago when it was your time youd know it
3336 ive enjoyed working with her shes an institution in the school system i regret it and hate losing her the older i get and closer i get to it i can certainly understand her decision i wish her the best
3337 weve been discussing what to do if she made that decision
3338 we dont have all those plans finalized but we do have a plan there will be some changes to the way that particular school is structured
3339 we might move on that sooner than we originally planned to
3340 well start looking to implement procedures on what to do to replace her shortly after school starts
3341 ive seen a lot of changes over the last 40 years good and bad
3342 everything revolved around the school now both parents have to work and theyre going in a hundred different directions i see it as a hardship for the families but theyve had to because of the economy
3343 we have parents working more than one job more single parents ive seen more grandparents and even great grandparents raising children and theyre doing a good job we help all we can because its been a long time since they had somebody in school
3344 i love seeing the children get out of their cars and seeing how excited they are to come to school and the trust the parents have in us they trust were going to take care of their child and were going to teach them everything they need to know
3345 my no 1 concern at this new school has been safety its been a real challenge

3358 at night theyre really pretty we just appreciate so much these guys doing that for the city

3360 we moved back here and started our business in albertville albertvilles been good to us and weve done a lot of work here we just wanted to give back to the city
3361 we feel horticultures a very important part of the city we felt like the signs needed to portray that look
3362 we just kind of came together as a team and built them to help out the city of albertville
3363 most of my life ive worked for civil service that really didnt afford me the opportunity to step out in the world of politics
3364 i looked at all of the candidates that had qualified at that time and made my choice based on what i knew about their political positions and mine
3365 i loved it and did not want to leave but it was just too costly
3366 it has proved to be a very good change for us no nights or weekends i have an actual life and can go visit my grandbabies in dothan
3367 its very good for employees just because its very convenient her prices are reasonable where people can afford to eat there a lot of people regularly come in from local businesses on this block

3403 i firmly believe that in the years ahead our military is much more likely to engage in asymmetric conflict than conventional conflict against a rising state power
3404 we must be ready for both kinds of conflict and fund the capabilities to do both
3405 there is no doubt in my mind that the modernization programs will continue to have strong institutional and congressional support i just want to make sure that the capabilities we need for the conflicts were in and most likely to face in the foreseeable future also are sustained long term
3406 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point
3407 but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern

3412 and epstein got jason bay a guy who was going to help him right away we couldnt give him a guy who was going to help him right away
3413 one pitch one mistake thats too much the ball didnt hit him
3414 i didnt do nothing yesterday one pitch one mistake i didnt try to hit him
3415 gonzalez is coming over here mainly because of the guzman injury and we need him to play shortstop
3416 that being said were going to try to see the younger guys
3417 when you are a free agent at the end of the year you always think about anything but it was a little surprising because i still believe that the tigers are still in the race at the time they were 5 1 2 games out of first in the american league central theyre just going through a different road and planning to catch brandon inge a little more
3418 he understands what it takes to be a yankee and hes excited about being a yankee and what lies before us and the challenges pudges caught in two world series was a champion in one
3419 he was anxious to get going he was anxious to be a part of this catchers got a lot to do you got to get new shin guards ready and fitted theres a lot of things that you got to do i was never traded in the middle of the season so i didnt have to deal with that
3420 he got here early went to lunch came back and wanted to watch a lot of film he talked to tony pena i think in a sense from a logistics standpoint the player that has to learn the most is a catcher because you got signs from the bench when youre on defense you got signs when youre on offense every pitcher has different signs so its a lot to go through
3421 molina is a doing a great job for the pitchers doing a great job defensively throwing and calling games
3422 to be honest it was a surprise its the last day of the trading deadline and a trade like this comes its still for me hard to believe that im here talking to you guys here in yankee stadium with a new york yankee uniform
3423 its going to be good for the yankees i think we have two good weapons for this team
3424 molina tony pena tells me that the pitchers are doing a good job of covering the runners were going to try our best to cut the running game out
3425 we want to cross that finish line and play a 163rd game this year hopefully every move we make will put us closer
3426 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
3427 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
3428 our forecast is for high defaults and bankruptcies this year and next
3429 the big question is going to be whether the economy goes into recession
3430 in matters of prioritizing what needs to be done immediately always supercedes what is seemingly important
3431 its a fundamental law of nature all things gravitate toward total chaos

3464 pero sin duda los temas m s importantes tienen que ver con dos tipos de problemas el primero los procesos judiciales hay mandatos importantes en lo que se refiere al deslinde de responsabilidades que tienen que ver no s lo en lo que corresponde al ministerio p blico sino tambi n las responsabilidades administrativas los rganos de control tiene pendiente
3465 y lo segundo tiene que ver con las reformas estructurales de la polic a por ejemplo estamos esperando que se integre un agrupamiento especial de la polic a con capacidad de tener intervenci n con j venes para qu ser a eso til por ejemplo en los partidos de f tbol esta agrupaci n una agrupaci n mixta se acercar a m s con un esp ritu de mediaci n de contenci n y resoluci n no violenta de conflictos y la fuerza p blica se quedar a atr s

3472 for nearly two years a young political aide sought to cultivate a farm system for republicans at the justice department hiring scores of prosecutors and immigration judges who espoused conservative priorities and christian lifestyle choices
3473 that aide monica m goodling exercised what amounted to veto power over a wide range of critical jobs asking candidates for their views ion and same sex marriage and maneuvering around senior officials who outranked her including the departments second in command the report concluded yesterday that goodling and others had broken civil service laws run afoul of department policy and engaged in misconduct a finding that could expose them to further scrutiny and sanctions
3474 nor is it the work of a few bad individuals
3475 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
3476 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us

3499 i will not read blogs im sorry if something is important enough it will be brought to my attention
3500 that right there is as plain as it gets about the racism in verona
3501 you would think the borough would come and do something about it
3502 verona was a place that you could raise a family
3503 it wasnt city life where you have to worry about being robbed walking down the street
3504 if you cant keep up with the times then who do you blame for that the worlds not going to stop growing because youre stuck in a time zone
3505 they always felt that they were second class citizens to oakmont
3506 you cant get a place like this in penn hills
3507 now im looking at the black people in the street like who the hell is that
3508 im a lot more frightened we have a lot of single mothers a lot of black babies are being born
3509 a lot of people have been born and raised in this town a lot of people are not accepting of change
3510 when i got here just on the other side of penn hills i figured what could be so different i was just shocked sometimes in this town they go too far
3511 we stepped into the kitchen area and announced who we were and that is when mrs berry came into the kitchen area
3512 we informed her that we have good information that the suspect was inside her residence
3513 if there is a chase and they see someone go in the house they can be there without a search warrant
3514 there have been reports of several individuals from the homewood area who are trying to rent or purchase property in verona
3515 if you should notice either a green suburban with spinners on the tires or a black jeep cherokee at a residence for an extended amount of time 8 hours or more or see anyone fitting the description moving into a property please call the police department with the address
3516 came from the police what the police wanted to know is are these people in fact truly interested in renting properties if thats truly what theyre saying when they pull up is that just a fa ade for why they are truly there
3517 im not a supporter of the program because of the way its running
3518 its not a racial issue the founders of the program have made it a race issue
3519 i dont know where theyre bringing them from but they are not from verona
3520 this vision of buses coming and unloading these black kids
3521 did you call each one of those kids to verify that they were from verona how do you know they werent lying
3522 and there was chaos between the church and the playground across the street
3523 people like the fact that theres a building where kids can hang out
3524 there would probably be a lot of problems if the program wasnt there
3525 i went into the newsstand to get a drink and so did mike
3526 mike went out before me and i guess the police thr ew him on the ground when i came out i tried to grab mikes hat and wallet and the police officer smacked the stuff out of my hand and started swearing at me and told me to leave or i was the next to get arrested
3527 without supervision children are going to find trouble its that simple
3528 i dont like to see a situation turned into a racial one if none exists
3529 i will vehemently deny that the police are doing anything wrong
3530 solely because theyre black what they are saying is that well the black people will come and lower my property value whites perceive it as a threat to their way of life
3531 weve been inclined to attribute all of this racial strife to just ignorance
3532 wed have solved americas problem a long time ago race is not as simple as people think
3533 even when blacks are in numbers like 40 percent i argue that whites are psychologically outnumbered
3534 protect and serve white people theyre just doing what the community wants to be done
3535 there needs to be communication people need to talk more
3536 go out there and be so sweet to that lady shes afraid of you
3537 last month conservatives led by newt gingrich and rush limbaugh sent over a million messages to congress calling for offshore oil drilling

3539 hopefully it will be a short thing in and out and well be back to this building as soon as possible
3540 it seemed really bad at the time because it was a surprise to see brown water in there
3541 at first i thought is there rust in my tank
3542 as that cold water impacts against the warm water the manganese from the bottom starts interacting and moving up through the zone right there
3543 it creates an interface somewhere where its going to come out of the solution
3544 the primary drinking water standards which are enforceable ones it has met all those requirements so its perfectly safe to drink its not going to hurt anybody if you can get by the color of it

3557 after seeing all the stuff that has been going on with the correctional officer william roberts that stole my name it makes me think back to a year and a half ago when we spoke
3558 i tried to talk to him like a big brother and let him know to be you and that he couldnt be me and that if he wanted to rap the lifestyle that he couldnt frame it based on my life
3559 how different his life would have been if he would have taken my advice

3580 chelseas working waterfront can often seem like an unfriendly uniniviting place

3586 laws favorable to homosexual unions are contrary to correct reasoning because they confer legal guarantees proper to the institution of marriage to unions between people of the same sex considering the values in question the state cannot legalize these unions without failing in its duty to promote and protect an essential institution for the common good which marriage is

3589 western media have been told this renewed surge of hiv infection is because there are not enough condoms in uganda even though we have many more condoms now than we did in the early 1990s when our hiv rates began to decline
3590 there will be no mention of condom or safe sex in the revised module on life skill education program but we will be focusing on the aspirations of the youngsters and will also talk about being faithful to ones partner and abstinence there should be no hypocrisy on the subject

3649 the impression that theres an increasing rate of autism in the somali community is definitely there and people are wondering whats going on
3650 if theyre having more children many of the siblings also have autism we have a number of somali families who have two children on the autism spectrum and sometimes more ive been working to get somebody to look at this and pay attention because it feels like this is too specific to somalis its got to be preventable
3651 theyre beginning to be aware that this is a huge issue in their community and theyre starting to come together and not isolate themselves
3652 theyre given more vaccines then we get and sometimes theyre doubled up
3653 then their children are given immunizations in somalia their generations have not received these immunizations and then suddenly theyre getting just a wallop of them in the moms and then in the babies thats certainly a concern thats been expressed to me by the somali population

3712 as the economy emerges out of a benign credit cycle increases in debt provisions are inevitable but in asbs case any losses are expected to remain relatively low

3756 the past is history the future is a mystery and today is a gift that is why they call it the present

3791 and the house republicans principled stance against this bill just three months before their own elections and even after the president pulled back his veto threat gives me many reasons for hope three fourths of the house gop voted against the bill last wednesday and three democrats even joined them to bring the nays to 152 it was the house gops finest hour on economic issues in a good long time extraordinary leadership and principled arguments against this bill were made by republican study committee chairman jeb hensarling house financial services committee ranking member spencer bachus and in the end house minority leader john boehner

3822 she actually ghost wrote parts of it with him the way princess diana helped andrew morton write his book on her thats why theres nothing too devastating in chriss book hes mean to others but not so much to his sister

3840 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
3841 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
3842 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen

3922 hes a return man that has some track record and he has a background in other areas be it as a gunner or covering kicks
3923 hes shown hes capable of doing that and hes had a nice career doing that
3924 i honestly think im peaking right now as far as my career goes and i feel better than i do when i had my pro bowl year
3925 this is a good situation for me to be a part of
3926 i just went in and had them checked out and they told me you know you have a little astigmatism
3927 im happy because i never knew now i can be 20 20 and be back in action
3928 theyve lost a friend theyve lost a teammate theyve lost a brother and thats not easy
3929 i think for the most part they understand the direction were going in some probably even support the direction were going in but its tough
3930 you take a player who has performed the way jason bay has performed off the team and you bring in three young players while 1 2 3 4 5 years from now it should be self explanatory right now its a shock
3931 its tough for these guys and tough to adjust to
3932 we felt we had the right deal and moved on
3933 if thats the case ill look forward to that atmosphere
3934 i played well and hit a lot of good shots
3935 im putting well so im looking forward to having a good week
3936 i tried to play to the fat side of the fairway instead of just hitting down the middle and i came off it a little bit
3937 it was a bad double i would have loved to make a bogey but a double is always a bad way to finish
3938 i pulled a muscle in my stomach and that takes a long time to heal you really dont want to hit any balls out of the rough or anything
3939 i got that worked out and then i had a few issues with my shoulder but i think ive got it all cleared away now
3940 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
3941 there wasnt a whole lot of pleasure watching that game
3942 we had a lot of baserunners and we were doing things at the plate we havent done lately
3943 we didnt get the big hit one hit here or there and it could be a different ballgame
3944 but when you have two or three of them it just really helps you focus in a little bit more
3945 when we were at offseason workouts i was having a couple of problems just because of my repetition
3946 well i feel that im back to where i was with catching the punts
3947 obviously i love touching the ball you get a little bit more joy when you run back a punt or get a touchdown for the most part i get the same joy on third and 4 when my receiver cant catch the ball
3948 seeing his abilities well coach to what he gives us a chance to do wade was pointing out how very interesting it is when you have a guy that can change direction like that and move around
3949 hes done a great job and hes brought a lot of energy to this team
3950 i know a lot of guys from boston and i dont have any particular fondness for them
3951 i have a fondness for this guy because he wants to get in there and kick your butt hes vicious hes relentless he goes in there to stop guys hes not just fooling around looking to get a check hes going in there to beat the expletive out of you and finish the fight if i have a fondness for him thats why not because hes from boston
3952 the list is long and the line is long and there are a lot of guys out there quality guys who have earned shots
3953 guys have to take a number kenny took his number and got his shot and he came up a little short its time for other guys to get their chance you have to think of the sport and the fans dont want to see the same three four guys always fighting for the title
3954 nobody wanted a kenny florian sean sherk rematch right after that fight
3955 it makes sense to us to go out and fight all the best and beat all the best and then go ahead and fight for the title it doesnt seem right to take one guy out and then get that immediate title shot
3956 i consider roger at the top of the weight class
3957 hes just been tearing through competitors in my opinion this was the best fight that could be put together in this division and im in the ufc to fight the best
3958 he was awesome if i didnt know better i would have thought he had years of experience doing it the hardest part of that is not stepping all over each other and making your points quickly he was so well spoken and he made excellent points and had good timing hell do that again someday im sure
3959 roger is a great fighter and hes a worthy guy but i dont believe hes on the level of a kenny florian
3960 im not sure roger could go five rounds with someone like sean sherk kenny has fought bigger and badder guys and i think that will show on aug 9
3961 roger has a great story and he has his struggle and people can relate to that he was a little kid selling gum on the streets of mexico to help his family kenny comes from a great family from dover and people go come on how can this guy be a fighter but hes a true warrior
3962 the thing i like about kenny is that he knows the way of the samurai
3963 when the samurai fights hes not emotional its an emotionless thing he doesnt use things someone else did to motivate him hes calm and cool and collected when he fights thats kenny too i really believe in this fight that kenny florian is going to be the matador and roger will be the raging bull hes upset at life and with the cards hes been dealt but kenny knows who he is and where he is and what he needs to do to get better he doesnt get emotional about it and i think that gives him an edge when he goes out to do his job
3964 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
3965 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point
3966 for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season
3967 we support his efforts if hes not just shifting cost to local government if he is truly going to cut the cost of government we are going to support him

3972 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
3973 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
3974 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
3975 believe me if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would
3976 i tried to get to lay down at 4 oclock this morning but was up 10 minutes later because every time i closed my eyes id see this man in the window with some guys head i had just smoked a cigarette with

3979 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3980 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3981 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
3982 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
3983 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
3984 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
3985 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3986 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3987 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
3988 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
3989 as i told the senator he can do more in six years that any of his opponents can do in 20
3990 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state
3991 he has done that over and over and over again whatever these charges are he deserves the respect and our admiration we should wait to see what actually happens before theres a call to do anything
3992 hes brought projects to the state hes put our people to work hes protected the labor agreements
3993 its hard to fathom or believe that a guy whos given his life to public service would jeopardize that for a viking stove and a good deal on a car and rebuilding his house
3994 think of all the thousands of families whose lives suddenly got better most folks in the lower 48 have no concept of that that seems like old news to them
3995 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
3996 i cant believe youre here i never stopped loving you why arent you dead and why are you in new hampshire
3997 whoa hold on dont you think you should look at his face

4019 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news

4025 we are disappointed and frustrated with the broadcast by sbs
4026 the purpose of the broadcast was aimed at heightening enthusiasm toward the beijing olympics by showing south korean viewers the magnificence of the opening ceremony there was no other intention
4027 we will provide sufficient access to the internet for reporters
4028 ensure that the beijing 2008 olympic games take place in an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
4029 the comments ive heard have been positive people say its a small price to pay when compared to owning a vehicle they say raise the rates but dont take away the service
4030 hmmm how can i mess stella up i know ill block her shots
4031 stealing cash stealing economic value is a crime its a crime in every system i know of taking property thats not yours thats a crime but when were dealing with virtual property that question might get a little more sophisticated how do we know whats somebodys and whats not somebody elses
4032 particularly if there is a set of algorithms or rules in the game that everything is free for the taking that might is right so we have to be very careful about terms like stealing because stealing might be clearly illegal clearly criminal and thats nothing new weve done that for millennia or it might be part of the gameplay at which point it is not illegal its encouraged as part of the overall interrelationships between the residents of the environment
4033 there is no one single approach taken by the providers of the virtual environments some virtual worlds such as second life were designed to include a minimum amount of governance residents of these worlds were expected to establish their community behavioral norms other virtual worlds include strong governance and control in these worlds such as the provider of the environment sets and enforces clear rules for behavior
4034 these are things that people can or cannot do to each other based on the way the virtual world operator has designed their environment violating these rules is simply impossible because the gameplay doesnt allow it to occur the code doesnt function that way
4035 who governs virtual world environments they are governed by criminal laws governed by torts governed by the virtual world providers rules and they are governed by social norms
4036 its a joint responsibility everyone provides a piece of the puzzle we have our criminal system that provides a piece of the puzzle our judicial system that enforces torts that provides a piece of the puzzle we have our virtual world provider and then the community itself does its own enforcement and that is a piece of the puzzle its a shared responsibility and it would be a mistake to focus on only one aspect
4037 congress has said for the most part they are not responsible for policing their own environments its totally up to them to decide how little or how much they want to do they might decide they want to make their world a police state and will regulate users interactions with each other very tightly 47 usc 230 says they can do that and they are not liable for the way they execute that philosophy
4038 similarly they can say were going to have a lawless environment and 47 usc 230 says if they want to do that they are still not responsible when people engage in bad behavior toward one another
4039 there are numerous gatekeepers in the virtual world safeguarding against numerous types of inappropriate behavior
4040 in second life for instance gatekeepers include our payment and credit card partners and our fraud and risk teams who guard against credit card fraud money laundering and phishing they also include our own governance team the g team which investigates abuse reports and guards against inappropriate content against teens on the adult grid etc and in many cases they include our own users who protect the space and land they inhabit
4041 as with any online community there are occasionally those who seek to disrupt others enjoyment but were able to effectively deal with any repeat disruptors by increasing the severity of the ban up to and including permanently terminating accounts
4042 virtual worlds that incorporate content that is inappropriate for minors generally require users to declare that they are old enough to participate most worlds that allow adult content provide clear warnings concerning the content
4043 avatars are not people they cannot be assaulted sexually or otherwise the one or two reports of sexual assault on avatars cannot be regarded as actual cases of assault any more than a description of an assault in a book or enacted in a play can be construed as being an actual assault

4077 my information from reporting today is that developer double fine brutallegend which owns the rights to its metal rock actioner starring jack black and thus doesnt have to just sit back and worry about what activision blizzard will do is very close to sealing a new deal to release the game
4078 to evaluate various options surrounding the release of the ghostbusters video game
4079 it wants the game to be released one way or another
4080 this has presented sony pictures consumer products with an opportunity to reevaluate the game release marketing strategy to potentially coincide with the 25th anniversary of the original film in 09

4083 the issue of homosexuality comes down to an issue about the bible
4084 underneath all the discussions and debates is how do we view the bible
4085 living under scripture the bishop and the bible in mission
4086 everyone in the anglican communion has their own process of making sense of the bible people who claim that their way of making sense is taking the bible more seriously than someone else are just trying to talk more loudly or stamp their foot more firmly
4087 is there such a thing as homosexuality in the ancient world did it exist then
4088 what you think is important in your context shapes the way you see scripture
4089 are understanding the bible in a very different way from that in which the rest of us think that it asks to be understood
4090 god uses language to tell us things and the bible is the language that hes used
4091 the bible is personal communication from the creator to us creatures and in personal communication you speak and write to be understood you dont communicate in code you dont say one thing in a way which is intended to be understood as meaning its opposite
4092 god is we believe straight forward the bible in that sense is straight forward and paul in 1st corinthians is straight forward
4093 whats the high common ground when we approach the bible

4106 so if the new owner does not go transfer title and ownership over to their name it will go to the registered owner
4107 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
4108 es lo m s cercano a lo pr stino que cualquier otro lugar que haya visto
4109 simplemente me enamor de todo el lugar dijo le hemos hecho mucho da o a este planeta aqu est intacto y es incre blemente hermoso se siente como un lugar donde una persona podr a marcar la diferencia
4110 vimos unas dos manadas a un kil metro en la secci n de estudio de la gran caldera dijo butynski hab a abundantes monos y no ten an miedo recuerdo haber pensado qu ingenuos eran pudimos realizar buenos acercamientos
4111 bueno dijo al fin evidentemente desconcertado tal vez los monos se fueron a otra parte de la selva para pasar la noche
4112 es una sorpresa dos driles coment deben haber estado durmiendo en los rboles cuando oyeron mi voz
4113 nadie ha estudiado la ecolog a y la conducta de estos animales en su estado natural afirm pero ahora se puede alguien podr a lograr que una manada de driles se acostumbrara a los humanos y empezar un estudio de largo plazo
4114 ciertamente ya no son ingenuos ni tan abundantes como en 1986 pero todav a hay una cantidad relativamente buena de ellos
4115 es una tasa mucho menor que la registrada en 1986
4116 la selva todav a est intacta incluso en lugares donde ahora no hay monos
4117 bioko no es como otras partes de frica oriental donde la gente ha talado los bosques de las cimas de las monta as para la agricultura sin embargo la gente de frica oriental rara vez caza monos
4118 s lo miren esas caobas en cualquier otra parte habr an sido talados hace mucho este lugar es demasiado remoto y dif cil para que tengan acceso a l grandes cantidades de cazadores es lo que mantiene a los monos relativamente a salvo
4119 sol amos pensar que los monos estaban a salvo aqu que los cazadores no viajar an a un lugar tan remoto
4120 saben que es una zona protegida pero la ley no se aplica as que entran sin problema y matan monos y ant lopes apunt
4121 los primates son portadores de epidemias y otras patolog as
4122 nadie le servir a su familia carne que los pueda enfermar
4123 la carne de mono es algo que hemos comido desde que ramos j venes tiene buen sabor y no es mala para uno coment jam s nos ha hecho da o
4124 ya no puedo comer carne de mono parecen personas y de cualquier manera es m s econ mico comer pollo
4125 parece que la sola prohibici n no es suficiente es necesario que se aplique la ley y que haya patrullas forestales armadas a adi al menos han dado el primer paso
4126 cada dos semanas vamos a encontrar otro asteroide con una posibilidad en mil de estrellarse contra la tierra
4127 este es un tipo de problema para el que el mundo no est preparado
4128 despu s de un par de a os aprend a descubrir cosas
4129 tendremos cat logos de todos los objetos que perturban la noche
4130 originalmente pens bamos en c mo aterrizar en un asteroide para empujarlo pero eso no funciona bien si la superficie se desmorona con facilidad la nave derrapar a m s a n los asteroides giran en el espacio si uno empuja un objeto en rotaci n el impulso se cancela
4131 en vez de tener algo f sico que lo conecte a uno con el objeto que se est remolcando s lo se usa la fuerza de gravedad entre los dos

4257 while i appreciate the governors leadership on this budget crisis i cannot support reducing the salaries of our state employees to minimum wage if our state workers had the power to pass a budget then it might be appropriate to hold them accountable but thats not where the responsibility lies according to our state constitution i cannot predict when a budget will be passed but i do know this when it does happen it will be because we worked to achieve bipartisan solutions i understand what the governor is trying to accomplish with this action but i must respectfully disagree and urge the governor to reconsider his executive order

4269 we had some really good talks with seattle id say they were pretty intense and pretty in depth we thought at one point there was a possibility to get something done there but it just didnt come to fruition we were ready to go forward both parties worked hard at the end of the day they probably werent as comfortable making the trade as we were that happens
4270 we talked to the doctor again today our worries arent that great i think what happened with scotty is if you know him at all hes not a go easy guy i think when hes working on something its an excess of swings excess of batting practice we just have to get him to back off a little bit and give his shoulder a chance to rest a little bit i talked to the doctor who performed his surgery again today and medically nobody has any concerns about him long term continuing to play he just needs a couple of days here and there in the course of the middle of the summer but were not worried at all like ive said before we made the trade we did all the background check we had to do on the surgery and we checked with all the rehab people we had our doctors check his shoulder is as strong as it can possibly be it just gets a little fatigued from overwork
4271 obviously the first thing we thought about is were not going to bring this kid up for one start and hurt his chances of playing on the olympic team and putting the olympic team in any kind of jeopardy we talked about that at length we said if this is going to be one start then we wouldnt bring the kid up but i also think that a lots being made out of this every kid dreams of playing in the big leagues i think if you went and asked all those canadian olympic kids last night when they were on the field if they wanted to switch uniforms with a big league guy right there as opposed to going to china i think youd have a consensus of saying theyd rather be a big league player i think thats an unfair shot at us saying that we did something that was against the canadian olympic team we have great respect for what they do and we have a great relationship with them but if we get a chance to bring a guy up to help our major legaue team unfortunately were not going to let that get in the way of us making the decision listen i was a part of the u s olympic selection committee twice so i know what gos into it but i also know that when a guy comes to the big leagues nothing gets in the way of that and thats really what the situation was with richmond

4362 just a couple years ago smith was lobbing insults at kerry saying he looks french and his policies are socialist

4366 these ahc affidavits are further evidence in a growing litany of potentially illegal abuses of taxpayer dollars by acorn and ahc members of congress who recently doled out millions of dollars to these groups in the housing bailout bill need to ask some serious questions to ensure that those taxpayer dollars are being spent properly and not illegally supporting political activity or being squandered by an organization with an already checkered past of voter fraud and embezzlement in addition to the affidavits these former employees have offered to assist any investigation with additional information it is time for congress hud and others to exercise proper oversight and investigate these entities before millions more in public funds are wasted
4367 not only did we find references to acorn having created ahc to serve purposes common to both organizations we noted numerous transactions and activities involving fraternal acorn related corporations
4368 total funding from huds fair housing initiatives this year is about 650 000 which will provide a good opportunity for acorn and ahc to work together on housing issues and campaigns

4391 i think its going to be tough for a lot of us down here
4392 words are so difficult to describe what it does to a family to have a child torn from you to have somebody taken from you well before their time
4393 they can be taken from you in the snap of a finger instantly i just never thought in my worst nightmare it would happen to me it would happen to us
4394 they told me that she had been involved in an accident and i interrupted the deputy because i then remembered that message that came across the screen and that was the and that was the first time then that i knew
4395 my daughter later told me that at 12 14 a m she was up in her upstairs bedroom and she saw daddy in the driveway crying with the officers and knew something was wrong
4396 i cannot describe for you the wailing the tearing the uncontrolled sobbing that now took place in our house for what seemed like eternity
4397 it seems strange that if you find humor in something that must be odd because of what youre suffering through
4398 you never know how your day is going to go when you wake up in the morning and thats whats very frustrating
4399 we utilize her difference making attitude as inspiration to make a difference
4400 i can only hope that the same emotion that i feel and that my family feels when they see that billboard that they feel too
4401 they are curious started out when they were little as just really snuggly and just really wanted to be held but once they started getting older they wanted to explore everything find everything but as you can see theyre attached at the hip
4402 there is a personal experience but it moves away from being centered on the one machine
4403 all i need today is an internet connection and a web browser

4422 hai ibrahim berpalingkah engkau dari kepercayaan dan persembahanku dan kepercayaan apakah yang engkau berikan kepadaku yang menganjurkan agar aku mengikutinya janganlah engkau membangkitkan amarahku dan cuba mendurhakaiku jika engkau tidak menghentikan penyelewenganmu dari agama ayahmu tidak engkau hentikan usahamu mengecam dan memburuk burukkan persembahanku maka keluarlah engkau dari rumahku ini aku tidak sudi bercampur denganmu didalam suatu rumah di bawah suatu atap pergilah engkau dari mukaku sebelum aku menimpamu dengan batu dan mencelakakan engkau
4423 oh ayahku semoga engkau selamat aku akan tetap memohonkan ampun bagimu dari allah dan akan tinggalkan kamu dengan persembahan selain kepada allah mudah mudahan aku tidak menjadi orang yang celaka dan malang dengan doaku utkmu
4424 gerangan siapakah yang telah berani melakukan perbuatan yang jahat dan keji ini terhadap tuhan tuhan persembahan mrk ini
4425 aku telah berulang ulang mengatakan kepadamu bahwa aku tidak mengharapkan sesuatu apapun drpmu sebagai imbalan atas usahaku memberi tuntunandan penerangan kepada kamu aku tidak mengharapkan upah atau mendambakan pangkat dan kedudukan bagi usahaku ini yang aku lakukan semata mata atas perintah allah dan drp nya kelak aku harapkan balasan dan ganjaran untuk itu dan bagaimana aku dapat mengikutimu dan menterlantarkan tugas dan amanat tuhan kepadaku padahal aku talah memperoleh bukti bukti yang nyata atas kebenaran dakwahku jgnlah sesekali kamu harapkan bahawa aku akan melanggar perintah tuhanku dan melalaikan kewajibanku kepada nya hanya semata mata untuk melanjutkan persembahan nenek moyang kami yang bathil itu siapakah yang akan melindungiku dari murka dan azab tuhan jika aku berbuat demikian sesungguhnya kamu hanya akan merugikan dan membinasakan aku dengan seruanmu itu
4426 aku bukanlah seorang pendusta dan fikiran ku tetap waras dan sihat tidak krg sesuatu pun dan ketahuilah bahwa patung patungmu yang kamu pertuhankan itu tidak dpt mendatangkan sesuatu gangguan atau penyakit bagi bandaku atau fikiranku kamu kenal aku sejak lama aku hidup di tengah tengah kamu bahawa aku tidak pernah berdusta dan bercakap bohong dan sepanjang pergaulanku dengan kamu tidak pernah terlihat pd diriku tanda tanda ketidak wajaran perlakuanku atau tanda tanda yang meragukan kewarasan fikiranku dan kesempurnaan akalku aku adalah benar pesuruh allah yang diberi amanat untuk menyampaikan wahyu nya kepada hamba hamba nya yang sudah tersesat kemasukan pengaruh ajaran iblis dan sudah jauh menyimpang dari jalan yang benar yang diajar oleh nabi nabi yang terdahulu karena allah tidak akan membiarkan hamba hamba nya terlalu lama terlantar dalam kesesatan dan hidup dalam kegelapan tanpa diutuskan seorang rasul yang menuntun mereka ke jalan yang benar dan penghidupan yang diredhai nya maka percayalah kamu kepada ku gunakanlah akal fikiran kamu berimanlah dan bersujudlah kepada allah tuhan seru sekalian alam tuhan yang menciptakan kamu menciptakan langit dan bumi menurunkan hujan bagi menyuburkan tanah ladangmu menumbuhkan tumbuh0tumbuhan bagi meneruskan hidupmu bersembahlah kepada nya dan mohonlah ampun atas segala perbuatan salah dan tindakan sesatmu agar dia menambah rezekimu dan kemakmuran hidupmu dan terhindarlah kamu dari azab dunia sebagaimana yang telah dialami oleh kaum nuh dan kelak azab di akhirat ketahiulah bahawa kamu akan dibangkitkan kembali kelak dari kubur kamu dan dimintai bertanggungjawab atas segala perbuatan kamu di dunia ini dan diberi ganjaran sesuai dengan amalanmu yang baik dan soleh mendpt ganjaran baik dan yang hina dan buruk akan diganjarkan dengan api neraka aku hanya menyampaikannya risalah allah kepada kamu dan dengan ini telah memperingati kamu akan akibat yang akan menimpa kepada dirimu jika kamu tetap mengingkari kebenaran dakwahku
4427 kami bertambah yakin dan tidak ragu lagi bahawa engkau telah mendpt kutukan tuhan tuhan kami sehingga menyebabkan fikiran kamu kacau dan akalmu berubah menjadi sinting engkau telah mengucapkan kata kata yang tidak masuk akal bahwa jika kami mengikuti agamamu akan bertambah rezeki dan kemakmuran hidup kami dan bahawa kami akan dibangkitkan kembali dari kubur kami dan menerima segala ganjaran atas segala amalan kami adakah mungkin kami akan dibangkitkan kembali dari kubur kami setelah kami mati dan menjadi tulang belulang dan apakah azab dan seksaan yang engkau selalu menakut nakuti kami dan mengancamkannya kepada kami semua ini kami anggap kosong dan ancaman kosong belaka ketahuilah bahwa kami tidak akan menyerah kepadamu dan mengikuti ajaranmu karena bayangan azab dan seksa yang engkau bayang bayangkannya kepada kami bahkan kami menentang kepadamu datangkanlah apa yang engkau janjikan dan ancamkan itu jika engkau betul betul benar dalam kata katamu dan bukan seorang pendusta

4437 i am particularly concerned by the sharp rise in the number of children needing to access homelessness services and the fact that families are being evicted from stable housing
4438 it is deeply concerning that while indigenous australians make up only 2 per cent of the general population this report shows that they make up 18 per cent of people seeking assistance through saap

4440 the australian government has made delivering long term solutions to homelessness a major priority and is developing a white paper to set the agenda for tackling homelessness to 2020 the white paper will be released in september 2008
4441 submissions to the discussion paper from homelessness organisations and frontline workers have provided excellent suggestions to improve saap services the needs of children are a high priority in the development of the white paper
4442 the rudd government has already announced the allocation of 150 million to build 600 new homes for the homeless across the nation over the next five years

4449 voting is the cornerstone of australias democratic system and young people who become eligible to vote for the first time need to be able to have their say at the ballot box just like everyone else

4454 as the average climate warms up the heat extremes will become more extreme and well have more intense more frequent and longer lasting heat waves as we progress through the 21st century
4455 its sort of been the quiet killer for many years
4456 there were a number of days where the body count kept increasing and there was absolutely nothing you could do because the heat had already taken its toll it was a helpless feeling
4457 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority
4458 i believe we should never have to make these kinds of choices ever again
4459 the big question is when will states hit the bottom we dont know
4460 i will not be able to pay my rent buy food or put gas in my car to transport my children
4461 the program is a head scratcher to think people are going to come forward and walk away from their life here it shows how desperate and delusional this administration has gotten in dealing with illegal immigration
4462 im going to go out on a limb here and say there wont be lines around the block for this program
4463 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4464 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
4465 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
4466 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
4467 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
4468 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4469 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4470 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
4471 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city

4475 the redevelopment is subject to both nsw and commonwealth planning approval including environmental conservation regulations and the afp will adhere to these strict controls
4476 the aipm has been responsible for the upkeep of the heritage management for the collins beach site and fully understands and appreciates these important aspects
4477 there is no doubt the aipm is best positioned to continue the conservation of the site
4478 measurement of time weight distance quantity and speed are fundamental to our daily lives we frequently need to be able to estimate quantities scientists require both accuracy and precision when measuring extremely small quantities

4482 privacy awareness week is a good opportunity to review your privacy practices
4483 privacy awareness week is an opportune time to review your practices and procedures for handling personal information
4484 good privacy will not only ensure compliance with australian laws but will improve client trust in an organisation
4485 a high quality agreement that covers goods services and investment the commitments go beyond what each country has committed at the wto
4486 were not going for the guinness book of records in terms of ftas but as a small country of only 16 million people we rely on them for our prosperity
4487 of course we have agreements in latin america with mercosur and the andean trade pact countries but also with the european union the non eu countries such as norway and switzerland the usa and the major asian economies of china korea and japan we also have an agreement with new zealand and want one with australia too as we regard australia and new zealand our role models we are a middle income country but aspire to be more like australia and new zealand in terms of economic sophistication and living standards
4488 the fta with china got through our national congress in a day as did the agreement with japan you couldnt see that happening in washington
4489 in 1990 43 per cent of chileans lived below the poverty line now it has been reduced to 13 per cent and extreme poverty is less than 5 per cent having an open economy is an important part of chiles success efforts of poverty alleviation
4490 we have lots of complementarities between our two economies in mining wine and agribusiness and australia is chiles fifth largest source of foreign investment
4491 excited about the fta in terms of profile building and the stronger creation of stronger personal ties between sydney and santiago
4492 beyond tariffs into important practical areas that affect services and investment like standards and intellectual property
4493 being in adelaide close to the wine areas has made it easy for us and australias prosperity is there for all to see however the strength of the economy has affected our ability to hire skilled labour and we have had some productivity issues as a result
4494 business culture differences that means chilean companies should use pro chile and the chamber to help them navigate through these culture issues
4495 given chiles propensity to sign ftas with everyone else if australia has no deal well be left out
4496 theres so much opportunity in the resources sector in south america and chile has been at the forefront our ability to offer performance based products enables us to take advantage of the high volumes we can sell in south america the fta will provide easy access to the whole continent given chiles strong trade links with its neighbouring economies
4497 i see the fta as a building bloc not a trading bloc or a spaghetti bowl of agreements the agreement with australia will help support agreements with the rest of apec and in chile we hope this will add momentum to open trade more globally
4498 for indian companies australia is not only an attractive market in its own right but a springboard for doing business in the asia pacific region the fastest growing in the world
4499 in recent years india has been seen to increasingly engage in the asia pacific region and there is tremendous potential for australian and indian companies to work together in further developing this exciting market
4500 this growth clearly signals indias keen interest in australia as an investment destination
4501 what we are experiencing is interest in australia not only in its resources sector but from a range of indian companies as a location for providing significant value add especially in the advanced manufacturing and information and communications technology supply chain and in australias biotechnologies capabilities
4502 the increasing adoption of these new aircraft maintenance licensing and training standards is helping the australian maintenance industry become more competitive internationally and also opens up business opportunities for a range of organisations
4503 organisations like nsw tafe will see greater demand for their training as airlines move to introduce new technology aircraft and train their workforces to meet changing demands
4504 this achievement is the result of close cooperation between casa and the aviation industry
4505 i congratulate tafe nsw for grasping the opportunity casa has provided to take up these world class standards

4508 30 years ago indigenous peoples land rights were recognised in the northern territory the high court has now recognised their rights in the inter tidal zone and waterways adjoining their traditional lands
4509 this decision means that the traditional owners the yolngu people can have certainty about their common law rights and it gives them a stake in the development of a sustainable commercial fishing industry
4510 i am delighted that the traditional owners have indicated that they will continue to work with the northern territory government commercial and amateur fisherman to reach agreement on future access to the inter tidal zone
4511 this high court decision should be seen as a positive step and presents another opportunity for indigenous and non indigenous australians to work together to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome
4512 at a time of global economic uncertainty australias improving trade performance is a source of strength
4513 and on the back of this weeks disappointing result at the world trade organization this unambiguous trade surplus underlines australias solid fundamentals as a trading nation
4514 the australian government will of course continue to play its part in efforts to ensure we can get the multilateral trade talks back on track because trade helps create more and higher paying jobs and offers australians more choice of goods often at lower prices
4515 the mission will raise the profile of australias clean energy capabilities promote australian innovation and connect australian companies to key chinese energy sector representatives and local customers
4516 it is estimated this will require a 350 billion in investment to achieve these targets australia has the expertise to work with china and to become a world leader in zero and low emissions technologies
4517 china is already our largest trading partner with continuing economic growth a dramatic rate of urbanisation the challenges of climate change and rising energy demands china is actively seeking solutions to improve sustainable practices
4518 companies participating in the clean energy mission will include a world leader in wind energy development roaring 40s from tasmania which has fast become the leading international wind energy developer in china
4519 roaring 40s is an excellent example of how climate change represents not just an environmental and economic challenge but also an opportunity to expand trade and create jobs
4520 more than 3000 australian and chinese businesspeople are expected to attend events at business club australia business club australia will use the resources of austrades network of 15 offices in china to bring together australians and key chinese officials and businesspeople

4522 in both cases it was a blatant bid to evade payment of duty and gst in the case of the cigarettes the tax involved was in excess of 2 million while the tax on the tobacco would have been more than 1 3 million

4527 the wedge tailed eagle and the tasmanian devil are australian icons but a changing environment disease and urban growth are all putting pressure on these wonderful creatures
4528 the natural resource management body in northern tasmania will protect the nests of the wedge tailed eagle by limiting public access and establishing protective vegetation screens around the nests
4529 the funding will also be used to improve vegetation corridors across tasmania to provide easier movement and safer breeding grounds for the tasmanian devil and support communities to restore wetlands and re vegetate degraded areas
4530 the australian and british governments have agreed that individual military burial is the most fitting way to commemorate our brave soldiers and will ensure the heroism they showed in the terrible battle of fromelles will be remembered and revered
4531 should these remains have been discovered by post war battlefield clearance teams in 1919 the war dead would have been re interred with individual headstones our men are no less deserving of that honour and dignity today
4532 whilst acquisition of the land near pheasant wood for a permanent war cemetery is a commonwealth war graves commission responsibility we acknowledge the generous offer of land by the owner of the mass burial site madame demassiet and will consider the needs of all parties including the tenant farmer in this process

4542 theyre like a dog with a bone and theyre not letting go
4543 were not necessarily for drilling where they republicans want to drill
4544 the top five oil companies are now on track to hit 160 billion in profits for the year
4545 my republican colleagues are buying the line of big oil
4546 surely americans are tired of republicans delaying and rejecting every effort democrats make to solve our nations energy problems
4547 the american people are clamoring for legislation that will bring down the price of gas
4548 i suspect that we are coming to the end of this downtrend as applications for new mortgages the most important series have flattened out there is a good chance of coming out of this in good shape but average housing prices are likely to be down this year relative to 2005 i dont know but i think the worst of this may well be over
4549 i think were right on the brink id be more surprised if we didnt than if we did given the financial state

4554 the danger exists in methods and tactics having absolutely nothing to do with picture taking
4555 in fact removing a camera from the equation is a very effective way of looking at this situation candidly
4556 recently the camera has come to serve as all but an official license to encroach on someones right to protect themselves from threats of danger it is also the most socially acceptable way to come within inches from someone who you do not know and who does not know you
4557 the extension of the conservatorship was at the request and suggestion of britneys doctors
4558 theyve indicated shes made great improvement but its a work in progress jamie spears doesnt want the conservatorship to last a day longer than the doctors recommend

4573 a estas alturas en am rica latina est fuera de orden un movimiento guerrillero y eso hay que dec rselo a las farc la guerra de guerrillas pas a la historia y las farc deben saber una cosa se han convertido en una excusa del imperio para amenazarnos a nosotros el d a que se haga la paz en colombia se le acaba la excusa al imperio les pido ayuda ya basta de tanta guerra lleg la hora de sentarse a hablar de paz
4574 me parece un d a no muy alegre en relaci n a las ltimas declaraciones del presidente ch vez
4575 decir que la lucha armada de las farc es un pretexto para el imperialismo es pura estupidez y tengo que decirlo y otra cosa m s ch vez no explica c mo las farc puede entregar los presos cuando tiene 500 guerrilleros pudri ndose torturados mal nutridos enfermos en los s tanos de las prisiones de uribe
4576 segunda pregunta es si ch vez entiende que la ltima vez que guerrilleros de las farc bajaron a la lucha electoral fueron masacrados y quiero preguntar si l est dispuesto a garantizar la vida de guerrilleros que tratan de entrar a la vida pol tica electoral frente a los paramilitares y militares que siguen en esta semana pasada matando sindicalistas no guerrilleros
4577 quiero preguntar si este an lisis y estas declaraciones realmente vienen del pensamiento de ch vez o est repitiendo la l nea cubana que hace muchos a os m s de una d cada est en contra de las farc
4578 mientras las farc tiene alg n peso en colombia una porci n de las tropas en colombia est orientadas hacia este conflicto mientras si no existe las farc es mucho mas f cil concentrar todos los esfuerzos contra venezuela

4581 cuando eeuu decide dar un paso los pretextos siempre les sobrar n durante d cadas de manera permanente dijo que sus repetidas intervenciones armadas eran para apoyar los intereses de sus connacionales y salvar sus inversiones ch vez lo sabe mejor que nadie por eso me ha parecido extra a su posici n y hasta he tenido duda que sea l

4584 dadas las circunstancias actuales en lo que a reservas se refiere s que es cierto que yacimientos que antes no eran rentables pueden comenzar a serlo ahora en este sentido si los estudios y perforaciones realizadas por la empresa estatal eniepsa en el a o 1978 frente a las costas del sur de galicia fueron tan optimistas como entonces se dijo la suerte estar a echada y quiz s nuevas prospecciones permitir an considerar la rentabilidad o no de posibles yacimientos

4613 initially she may not be aware that shes been kidnapped
4614 she may just think she is going on a trip with her dad and is excited about it
4615 as time continues reigh will begin to question what is going on and most likely want to speak with her mother
4616 she will have difficulty accepting that she cannot call and may ask her dad why it will be interesting to know how he will respond
4617 in this situation there were measures in place to protect this little girl that were broken
4618 he was only allowed supervised visits that makes me wonder what happened that he wasnt allowed to see his daughter for a period of time and why he had to see her under the watch of a social worker
4619 being taken from a parent is a very traumatic experience
4620 not only does this little girl have to manage the reality of divorce moving from her father but now she is taken from her mother as well without understanding why i would imagine that she is going to have some anxiety issues some traumatic recollections and possibly some depression as a result her levels of fear could really escalate

4631 a half hour later matthew opened the bedroom door mumbled well bye and walked out the friend found her passed out on the bed in her panties
4632 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
4633 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
4634 this is the first time a national team has come to shoreline community college to play
4635 its a great opportunity for our students and the community
4636 she was excited to get a chance to be in her first triathlon
4637 i like to swim i love to bike and i like to run
4638 its fun and a healthy way to stay active and to support a good cause
4639 we had a make shift defense our guys did as well as could be expected
4640 quite a few guys had to play both ways it makes a difference i wish we could have had a full team were so talented youve have to play with who you have and do the best job you can
4641 i fully expect to get seven or eight guys back
4642 if we can get some of our defensive players back and we have the same intensity we had against willamette valley we had a good chance to win
4643 he actually started slow and gave a lot of pitches in the first but he got dialed in
4644 we didnt really change our strategy but i told them we couldnt be overconfident
4645 i mean these guys worked really hard to get here so we couldnt think that
4646 i just hoped to keep the ball in play and let the defense work the game
4647 my first home run in the all stars all i could think is yeah
4648 these guys played really well it was really tricky to keep them ready through that losers bracket
4649 we did nothing wrong the guys made some great plays then we got here and came up against some of the finest pitchers and finest hitters around were happy for mill creek theyre a monster team to face
4650 were here to win and have fun were not playing for a short trip
4651 when i came to seattle i thought id gone to heaven they gave me 12 000 they gave me a 2 000 raise
4652 i said gosh thats great thank you i just wanted an opportunity to continue playing the biggest obstacle i had going for myself at that point in time was the injury that i was trying to work through as it turned out that pretty much took me down that was the end of my career after i had that injury
4653 every time wed play new york id go for 12 or 15 points because when i got in the game the game was over with
4654 one of the guys i used to play against all the time was current lakers coach phil jackson the first time we went back in new york they were beating us by 25 or something in the middle of the fourth quarter i made a move and phil blocked the shot ok fine i start looking down the floor i look at willis reed and i say help willis turned around and told phil let him go whos going to get hurt nobodys going to get hurt it was the famous garbage time for a lot of guys who didnt get a lot of playing time when you got into the game you were going to put the ball up
4655 one of the most unique things about that team the first year was no matter what happened or what somebody was doing if i had a party if dorie murrey a forward who now sells real estate in mill creek had a party if star guard walt hazzard had a party everybody was invited
4656 there were no cliques there was none of this to me it was a really good experience because it gave me an opportunity to understand what a lot of things are about thats one of the things i have a very hard time with in todays world with the game of basketball its all about money back then you went to work and you had to produce you had to make things happen to me that was the most challenging part of it is you got to basically write your own future you know in todays world these kids come out theyre a lottery pick or theyre taken in the first round or something you got a lot of money coming your way
4657 its not a comfortable thing for me to do any more from the time the game starts to the finish youve watched a three ring circus if i go to a basketball game i go to watch basketball
4658 to be honest with you i was extremely excited when howard schultz bought the team because the first day he had a press conference and he made the comment that he was going to do what he could to build a winning franchise
4659 and being the ignorant country boy that i am i sat there and said you know hes got the money maybe hes got the heart and hes going to go out and do it and the only free agent he ever signed was danny fortson and danny fortson used him like a dang old watch
4660 at that point in time when clay bennett came along and offered him 120 or 150 million more than what the team was worth you know all that schultz cared about was the money
4661 the bennetts and all those other people they had money and they were willing to spend it and they did yeah they gave the city 45 million to settle the citys suit against them and the two remaining years on the key arena lease the city probably would have settled for 35 who knows all they wanted was money and thats what bennett threw out in front of them was money
4662 out of the whole situation where i feel cheated more than anything are my six grandkids
4663 my kids understood that i played for the sonics they never saw me play because they all came later but they understood that i was involved and stuff to try to explain this to the grandkids when theres not a sonic basketball team here grandpa used to do that that bothers me more than anything i just feel theyve cheated me out of part of my life but again its a business and those things happen in business people have to learn to accept it
4664 as years went on i regarded him as a role model and mentor if i was stuck he was someone i could lean on
4665 he was just a huge support and continued to be as i coached
4666 you cant miss the man on a wednesday and friday night
4667 hed have a story a day about playing in the nba
4668 these kids its a really hard to explain what each one of these kids have meant to me over the years
4669 the respect that theyve given me plus what i see them achieve in life is what totally blows me away
4670 people ask me why do you go watch shorecrest basketball this is the reason because theyre human beings
4671 im not giving them the tools to become a great basketball player i try to give them the great tools for life ive had kids call me from college when theyve gotten in trouble and my first question is why in the hell are you calling me you need to call your mom and dad they say dads going to mad dads going to be madder if you dont call him and tell him whats going on
4672 while it will hardly be the showdown it could have been the drama will still be palpable
4673 but im putting to bed the idea that well see a deal with microsoft anytime this year
4674 theyve lost about 140 executives over the last 6 to 8 months there has been a stream of executives exiting

4678 i now realise that art for arts sake was actually a cry for help from oscar wilde and his friends against the reality which is art for moneys sake
4679 it may be a long time before we see prices as good as these again but it may just be that we are at the start of a boom which could last as long as the one in the 19th century mainly 32 years between 1863 and 1895
4680 photography i think as far as other media are concerned is still undervalued in general primarily because it can only be as old as the invention of the camera
4681 in the early 1990s records were being set at 10 000 to 15 000 now records are being set at 2 5m or 3m for a photograph
4682 our average loan size is 5m so we arent going to have thousands of clients
4683 we deal with everybody but we dont make loans below 250 000 simply because were just not geared to that level of business
4684 that being said we would have to have a minimum value of 500 000 of collateral that we were lending on
4685 that still leaves plenty of collectors out there but we dont tend to do the smaller entry level type works
4686 no collector buys in a void nothing happens in the way of collecting without information information is at the core of it
4687 you cant be a collector by just looking around and picking things
4688 the last thing you want to do is to get somebody to buy something through your own passion and your own directive that theyre not engaged with because the process ends at that moment because then it just becomes get me a damien hirst get me a warhol and that isnt collecting
4689 in 20 years time i believe that the most expensive prices surfacing on the art market will be coming out of china and russia and india probably for artists none of us has heard of in the west and possibly for pictures that have not yet been painted

4697 i told her i was labour when she cuddled up to me in downing street i said dont cuddle me im labour she said never mind come and let us have a cup of tea
4698 lauda was basically sitting in the middle of a fire and i would guess it would be about a minute before we managed to get the belts undone
4699 in the meantime ertl had got a fire extinguisher from somewhere and was aiming it towards the central cockpit area so he was able to keep the fire under some sort of control
4700 lauda was conscious most of the time and was saying get me out
4701 it is clearly important that i and the public should have a fuller picture of the facts
4702 today i have issued the order you have been waiting for the order to begin open battle against polands age old enemy the german invader
4703 after nearly five years of uninterrupted and heavy fighting underground today you will carry your arms in the open in order to free your country again and to render exemplary punishment to the german criminals for the terror and crimes committed on polish soil
4704 ive got to keep my eye on the road every second
4705 i think without doubt weve just witnessed the greatest day of scientific exploration that weve ever seen in the space programme possibly of all time
4706 misogyny wears many guises reveals itself in different forms which are dictated by class wealth education race religion and other factors but its chief characteristic is its pervasiveness
4707 hillary hated on you so that b amp is irrelevant
4708 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
4709 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
4710 the sexist misogynist patriarchal ways of thinking and behaving that are glorified in gangsta rap are a reflection of the prevailing values in our society values created by white supremacist capitalist patriarchy
4711 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
4712 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
4713 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
4714 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
4715 tax rebates have been a very effective way of propping up the economy in the second quarter and less so in the third quarter
4716 to fix the economic growth problems you have to restore liquidity to the system
4717 i think in the short run its going to be a tug of war between the optimists and the pessimists
4718 i think both sides are going to be able to find enough information to support their case
4719 the challenge is you cant identify what the catalyst is that will change psychology
4720 what pat seriously why are you such a fringe psychonaut
4721 we have a responsibility to talk about whether these accusations are deserved pat i think when john mccain doesnt speak to pat buchanan as being presumptuous calls himself president mccain but barack obama speaks to you as presumptuous for doing something much less damning that says much more about you than it does the candidates
4722 his resume is very thin the american people dont know who he is if the msnbc shows say this night after night those less intelligent voters or those in a news hold will certainly come to believe it
4723 the crotchety old white women who were probably racists anyway and we dont need them
4724 hes the kind of guy you want to have a beer with
4725 it seems to me we are living in a time in which fear is used as a tool in the media entertainment culture and politics
4726 the media could do a much better job thats for sure especially the media that targets women human rights they couldnt care less their message to women is all about consumerism looking sexy and pleasing men in bed and yet they have the potential to make profound changes for the better in womens lives
4727 i have more freedom when i write fiction but my memoirs have had a much stronger impact on my readers somehow the message even if i am not even aware that there is one is conveyed better in this form
4728 we often hear about many hundred thousands killed in darfur and two million in cambodia all these big numbers memoirs bring it down to a family a face it breaks down that barrier of what is cambodia vietnam sierra leone darfur down to a father a mother a brother a sister how i missed my mother is that very different from how your children miss you how i long for my fathers touch on top of my head is not different from any other childs longing
4729 as a child it took courage to survive the war that i was in
4730 as a young girl it took courage to be true to my brown skin in a sea of white children it takes courage for all of us to be a woman a mother a sister to be together in a society that is breeding so much fear
4731 women have always been courageous they are always fearless when protecting their children and in the last century they have been fearless in the fight for their rights in times of conflict war poverty or religious fundamentalism women and children are the first and most numerous victims women need all their courage today
4732 we get so caught up in all these different issues whether its the economy the war oil crisis or the election that sometimes we forget about the challenges women face every day its important to come together and to re connect on that level
4733 sisters talk to each other be connected and informed form womens circles share your stories work together and take risks together we are invincible there is nothing to be afraid of
4734 our role as grandmothers is to protect young women and children to work for peace in every way and at every level and to improve the quality of life for everybody not just the privileged
4735 overall i think the more team members we have be it memoir writers journalists peace corps volunteers to go out there and report on human rights issues in the world the better
4736 ultimately i think our goal is the same to create a safer and better world for all of us
4737 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
4738 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
4739 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
4740 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
4741 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
4742 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did

4748 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future

4762 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
4763 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
4764 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the
4765 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
4766 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector

4778 the only real comparison we can make is when the following years results come out then we can see whether it is getting better or worse and we can then move from there
4779 we must not always compare ourselves with those who are below us
4780 what does it take to practice continuous improvement on a national scale

4782 i just wanted to get out here today just so i could get back in practice i dont really like sitting out and watching guys bust their behinds when i can be out there doing something
4783 am i happy with that no i want to be a starter
4784 ive always said i dont want to be a backup in the nfl thats not something im thrilled about but that is the role and i have to embrace it
4785 i would say it was a fiasco and i would say it was as clueless of a staff as ive ever heard we had guys in the nfl with 200 years of experience in the locker room some guys 10 years some guys 13 15 years talking to those guys it was a complete joke so that was a hard situation to be a quarterback who has never played in that situation certainly was difficult
4786 i think at one point i was 10 points higher than everybody and a handful less picks and obviously it didnt matter so thats disconcerting when youre in a situation when its open competition and it doesnt matter
4787 it was a year where at a couple of points he was hoping to be traded that didnt happen obviously he came back and had a good offseason its just been one thing after another he played a little bit then another guy comes in then we draft jamarcus then we sign daunte so hes had a lot of stuff to go through it has made him stronger

4791 this is no surprise to our staff affected employees were informed of this before these changes occurred
4792 whether or not superannuation is deducted from any payment is based on the nature of the payment not on the employment arrangements

4800 no me une ning n v nculo con antonio brack ni con la asociaci n de exportadores adex pero me irrita profundamente cuando un asesor del ministro de agricultura los acusa de ignorantes por el simple hecho de poner en cuesti n el ingreso de semillas transg nicas es curioso que brack que es uno de los ministros mejor calificados del actual r gimen sea maltratado de esa manera y ninguno de sus colegas en el gabinete reaccione en mi caso reacciono como un ciudadano que a pesar de estar en desacuerdo con su apuesta por un gobierno tan poco interesado en mejorar la gesti n del medio ambiente o por sus opiniones en relaci n al proyecto majaz considera que brack es una persona que ha aportado mucho al per y que en el caso de los transg nicos ha asumido la defensa del patrimonio nacional finalmente as le incomode a quien le incomode tiene todo el derecho como ciudadano y la obligaci n como ministro del ambiente de dar su opini n sobre este tema

4808 those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it
4809 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy
4810 let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
4811 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
4812 my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause
4813 common looking people are the best in the world that is the reason the lord makes so many of them

4815 labor is prior to and independent of capital capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration
4816 i cannot make it better known than it already is that i strongly favor colonization
4817 i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me
4818 in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth other means may succeed this could not fail the way is plain peaceful generous just a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless
4819 with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations
4820 a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other
4821 i would rather be defeated with this house divided against itself cannot stand in the speech and uphold and discuss it before the people than be victorious without it
4822 both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came
4823 i am rather inclined to silence and whether that be wise or not it is at least more unusual nowadays to find a man who can hold his tongue than to find one who cannot

4827 i have never studied the art of paying compliments to women but i must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of america it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war i will close by saying god bless the women of america
4828 i have not permitted myself gentlemen to conclude that i am the best man in the country but i am reminded in this connection of a story of an old dutch farmer who remarked to a companion once that it was not best to swap horses while crossing streams
4829 whenever i hear any one arguing for slavery i feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally
4830 the probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just it shall not deter me

4833 property is the fruit of labor property is desirable is a positive good in the world that some should be rich shows that others may become rich and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another but let him labor diligently and build one for himself thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built
4834 the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country
4835 my friends no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting to this place and the kindness of these people i owe everything here i have lived a quarter of a century and have passed from a young to an old man here my children have been born and one is buried i now leave not knowing when or whether ever i may return with a task before me greater than that which rested upon washington without the assistance of the divine being who ever attended him i cannot succeed with that assistance i cannot fail trusting in him who can go with me and remain with you and be everywhere for good let us confidently hope that all will yet be well to his care commending you as i hope in your prayers you will commend me i bid you an affectionate farewell

4837 i will say then that i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race i say upon this occasion i do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything
4838 i have never said anything to the contrary but i hold that notwithstanding all this there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the declaration of independence the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

4842 the will of god prevails in great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of god both may be and one must be wrong god cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time in the present civil war it is quite possible that gods purpose is something different from the purpose of either party and yet the human instrumentalities working just as they do are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose
4843 we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature
4844 what is conservatism is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried
4845 we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing with some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labor here are two not only different but incompatible things called by the same name liberty and it follows that each of the things is by the respective parties called by two different and incompatible names liberty and tyranny

4853 i do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the united states and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands to set apart and observe the last thursday of november next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent father who dwelleth in the heavens and i recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to him for such singular deliverances and blessings they do also with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience commend to his tender care all those who have become widows orphans mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged and fervently implore the interposition of the almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace harmony tranquillity and union
4854 i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom
4855 it is said an eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence to be ever in view and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations they presented him the words and this too shall pass away how much it expresses how chastening in the hour of pride how consoling in the depths of affliction
4856 if all do not join now to save the good old ship of the union this voyage nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another voyage
4857 neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease each looked for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces but let us judge not that we be not judged the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully the almighty has his own purposes
4858 all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics
4859 you think slavery is right and should be extended while we think slavery is wrong and ought to be restricted that i suppose is the rub it certainly is the only substantial difference between us
4860 stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong
4861 to state the question more directly are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated even in such a case would not the official oath be broken if the government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it but it was not believed that this question was presented it was not believed that any law was violated the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it is equivalent to a provision is a provision that such privilege may be suspended when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety does require it it was decided that we have a case of rebellion and that the public safety does require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was authorized to be made

4868 i think we can all agree that the behavior of the paparazzi is out of control and needs to be reigned in before someone gets seriously injured or killed
4869 the safety zone is six feet i think its completely unenforceable
4870 unless every celebrity has a chaperone or a police officer with a six feet tape measure who are you going to enforce it

4893 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4894 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4895 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4896 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4897 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4898 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4899 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4900 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4901 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4902 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4903 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4904 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4910 i find television to be very educating every time somebody turns on the set i go in the other room and read a book
4911 but especially at her impressionable age finding something else to read has to be preferable to exposing seventh graders to a simplistic cookie cutter depiction of religion and the religious

4914 they act like a pack of wolves stalking their prey
4915 the idea of trying to create a secure space around a celebrity whos a celebrity you me by some definition we all fit
4916 what is this protected space that they are entitled to that the rest of us are not entitled to
4917 this task force hopefully can look at 911 maybe we do need to create a separate number for paparazzi issues and for celebrities
4918 they know who you are you have an id number and we can help you then maybe we can charge separately maybe to the academy to the screen actors guild
4919 resources on duty that evening were all on duty personnel
4920 half of this issue actually about 90 percent of the issue is that celebrities should keep their clothes on
4921 paris hiltons out of town things are quiet lindsey lohans got a new girlfriend thats keeping things quiet and evidently britney has gone straight now in terms of cleaning her act up so basically paparazzi are losing interest
4922 the danger exists in methods and tactics having absolutely nothing to do with picture taking in fact removing a camera from the equation is a very effective way of looking at this situation candidly
4923 recently the camera has come to serve as all but an official license to encroach on someones rights to protect themselves from threats of danger it is also the most socially acceptable way to come within inches from someone who you do not know and who does not know you
4924 it is our view that significant laws and statutes are presently on the books to control overzealous paparazzi
4925 while the ppagla agrees with councilman dennis zine that paparazzi behavior can be considered reckless we do not see a need for further legislation that would prevent journalists from gathering the news
4926 they have no passion for media they have no passion for journalism or good news stories they just want to make that fast buck thats a big difference between a real journalist and a paparazzi
4927 what im here to do is listen im here to try and find a balanced answer theres no question that the industry of public information is an important one to protect and i think that theres responsibility on the side of entertainers as there is responsibly on the side of those seeking to take photographs
4928 what were saying is that we ought to allow it to expire and if democrats want to reinstitute the ban theyll do so at their own peril
4929 i think its an important issue and well have a lot more to say about it in september
4930 the last time they did this we won the issue in the publics mind
4931 he was not interested in what we had to say
4932 he gave us the impression that the last thing he wanted was for iraq to look anything like a success for the united states
4933 as far as he is concerned this is bushs war and must end in lack of success if not actual defeat
4934 when letterman is doing top ten lists about something it has officially entered the public consciousness
4935 and it usually stays there for a long long time
4936 i was puzzled by this notion that somehow what we were doing was in any way different from what sen mccain or a lot of presidential candidates have done in the past
4937 now i admit we did it really well but that shouldnt be a strike against me
4938 now i admit we did it really well but that shouldnt be a strike against me
4939 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
4940 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words
4941 if senator mccain wants a debate about taxes in this campaign thats a debate im happy to have
4942 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
4943 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
4944 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
4945 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
4946 wir haben um die akte vom amt f r landwirtschaft gebeten um die ganze information zu kennen im moment wird die subvention nicht ausgef hrt werden solange die ganze angelegenheit nicht aufhellt

4948 altering ones genetic makeup to impact athletic performance is unacceptable gene doping is cheating and its dangerous professional sports organizations should ban it all athletes deserve to compete on an even playing field gene doping undermines that right
4949 friends of the earth opposes all genetic modification of life including human life it is important to protect the gene pool our most basic common natural good from genetic pollution caused by genetic engineering it is impossible for humans to comprehend the implications of manipulating the genetic makeup of nature
4950 sport discriminates against the genetically unfit sport is the province of the genetic elite or freak by allowing everyone to take performance enhancing drugs we level the playing field we remove the effects of genetic inequality far from being unfair allowing performance enhancement promotes equality
4951 t his double bind structure pervades girards explanatory system both in reference to individual cognition and to sociohistorical development in girards hypotheses the same principle accounts for the positive as well as the negative traits of a given phenomenon imitation breeds conflictual results but is also the basis of any cultural transmissions its how we learn the other may act as a pedagogical model but she or he may also become a rival in girards anthropological recount the sacred is what controls collective violence but is itself also based on a pharmacological use of violence this is indeed one of the intellectual challenges of mimetic theory it forces us to think not in a dialectical sense as in a system of clear cut oppositions but by antinomies that is by concilliating polarized elements of phenomena which inevitably appear paradoxical because they are generated by a single yet ambivalent basic cognitive mechanism imitation
4952 in spite of having been deconstructed by a century of critical and philosophical discussions structuralism post structuralism hermeneutics this belief in the autonomy of the self mainly derived from the idealistic romantic tradition remains still deeply grounded in our understanding of the modern mind we always tend to represent ourselves as autonomous in respect to our choices desires and convictions moreover there is always a blind spot in our perception of reciprocal hostility competition and rivalry we are ready to deconstruct anything except the idea that we are self directed and that the persecutors are always the others
4953 christianity is essentially the cultural and moral acknowledgement of the sacrificial origins of our culture and our society the end of religion and even scientific atheism itself has been produced by a religion christianity
4954 i f the sacrificial structure cannot work any longer because its injustice and arbitrary nature have been unmasked then from an evolutionary viewpoint modern society is facing a new experimental phase while history becomes a laboratory in which humanity tries to find new processes and structures of equilibrium and stability
4955 the expansion of the christian paradigm which has imposed the rejection of the sacred and triggered the secularization of the world in fact signifies a phase in which man is no longer protected by the false transcendence of the sacred by the rigid processes of the systemic use of violence either actual or symbolic the gradual erosion of every dharma of every rigid social hierarchy and division based on sacred norms has plunged the modern individual into mimetic social flux deep into ever more extreme oscillations of desire and resentment mobilized by the increasing democratization of societies because im guessing democratization makes us all more or less equals erasing differences what has been needed therefore are structures of containment based on forms of secularized transcendence democratic ideology and institutions technology mass media market society the objectification of individual relationships etc which contribute to the postponement the holding back of the apocalyptic event the real ambivalent potential terminus of the dissolving of the religious sacred order of the world either the revelation of violence or the dissolution through violence
4956 i think that on the one hand it is true that i tend not to belong to specific environments or fields but on the other hand i cannot be considered an outsider in the classical sense of the term i never felt an outcast as many intellectuals like to represent themselves this is probably because i had and still have a very strong sense of belonging to my childhood i had a very happy childhood and i have always tried to surround myself with the things of my childhood
4957 the capacity to be surprised is legitimately regarded as the main scientific emotion there is a form of humility as well in the sense that it is a methodological attitude a postulate that you have to have in order to solve specific problems i have the impression sometimes that the book i am reading could upset my entire existence
4958 preferential sign of victimization the scapegoat will be chosen anyway at that crucial moment something will often be interpreted as a sign anything and everybody thinks they have found the solution the culprit in a way the scapegoat mechanism functions like a false science like a great discovery that is made or something that is suddenly revealed and then one reads in the eyes of other people the same insight
4959 if anyone kills cain he will suffer vengeance seven times over
4960 that law my emphasis represents the foundation of culture because capital punishment is already ritual murder
4961 one must never exclude the possibility of violence that has nothing to do with mimetic desire but simply with scarcity
4962 but it is also true that the conflicts once triggered easily become trapped in a mimetic mechanism
4963 the united states and israel share deep concern about irans nuclear program and the two delegations discussed steps to strengthen diplomatic efforts and financial measures to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability

4996 there had been no warnings prior to that point in the game

5029 as with ordinary waking up there are many people who are somewhere in between but the point is that there is such a thing as being asleep and such a thing as being awake and it is important to tell the difference and to be sure youre awake by the time you have to be up and ready for action whatever that may be with the resurrection of jesus the world was being invited to wake up

5148 it is a pledge made by every candidate in every campaign to run on the issues and avoid negative attacks just last month john mccain pledged that throughout the campaign he would show my admiration and respect for senator obama as for obama he pledged to run a different campaign run a positive campaign well that was then today the attacks were flying so fast and furious it was sometimes hard to keep up
5149 the mud has indeed been flying with obama constantly comparing mccain to president bush and today mccain comparing obama to empty celebrities all sizzle no substance
5150 repeated votes on immigration and the iraq war also helped elevate republican john mccain of arizona one of bushs chief adversaries in the senate in 2005 to be one of his biggest supporters in 2007 mccains 95 percent support score for last year was the highest in the chamber
5151 mccain has recently said obama would rather lose a war to win an election hes called him dr no on energy reforms and run ads blaming obama for high gas prices today mccain unveiled a new ad in 11 states flashing images of britney spears and paris hilton suggesting obama is just another vapid celebrity
5152 obama campaign dismissed the ad as more of mccains steady stream of false negative attacks
5153 obama told an audience in missouri the republicans are just trying to scare voters
5154 obama supporters called attention to the shoes mccain has worn on stops throughout the rust belt

5176 nu se poate spune cu exactitate cind ajunge viitura pe prut cu singuranta nu in noaptea asta pentru ca in urmatoarele ore nu este preconizat sa creasca nivelul semnificativ potrivit calculelor noastre viitura trebuia sa ajunga mai repede dar s au creat un fel de buzunare in partea stinga a prutului si apa s a dus mult spre republica moldova
5177 exista zone unde garda digului s a tasat si vrem ca prin aceste operatiuni de suprainaltare sa putem mentine si sa rezistam la un debit de pina la 850 de metri cubi pe secunda cit se elibereaza din acumularea de la stinca costesti debitul acesta este istoric nimeni nu poate spune cum se va comporta prutul si cum va inunda zonele din albia riului riscul la care sint supusi locuitorii din zona inundabila este prea mare si de aceea masura de evacuare nu a fost ridicata
5178 pentru ca oamenii sa si mai poata recupera din documente si pentru a si hrani animalele s a mai permis ca unii sa se reintoarca in localitatile evacuate asta se va face pina cind semnalele celor care patruleaza pe dig vor indica faptul ca nivelul apei creste alarmant
5179 speram ca prin aceste interventii sa putem evita revarsarea in incinta 1 a prutului sau in cel mai rau caz pastrarea intre diguri a acestui curs de apa cit mai mult timp

5210 it is staggering to learn that more than 175 000 laptops are lost or go missing in major european airports every year many containing sensitive information that organisations must account for
5211 it departments must re evaluate the steps they take to protect mobile professionals the laptops they carry and company data stored on mobile devices
5212 high profile laptop losses have become rife in recent months showing just how important it is to make sure devices are properly secured
5213 even though people know that laptops can be easily stolen or lost they still seem ambivalent to the threat
5214 the alarmingly high numbers of devices that are lost by ordinary people each week highlight that this does not always happen to someone else

5233 they were a little bit associated with ken keseys bus and were involved in drug distribution
5234 it all seemed fine to me i got some interesting tapes from that source
5235 no you dont have to be a musician to make a tape

5240 se est volviendo pol ticamente necesario porque el nivel de conflictividad y de desprestigio en el cual est cayendo el referendo revocatorio nos lleva a esa necesidad de introducir algunos ajustes en el contenido de la ley

5242 lo grave es que si esas actitudes se siguen profundizando no es otra cosa que un desacato civil y pol tico es como decir que dentro de las fuerzas armadas o polic a existan fracturas haya comandantes que no acepten las decisiones de la cabeza de la instituci n a ese nivel estamos llegando

5261 personally and professionally but hes earned the right to pursue whatever opportunities he thinks will make him happy
5262 im disappointed hes going for me personally for us professionally
5263 but when there were rumors about him going to toronto a year ago i said this entire organization is indebted to scotty for what he did from 1994 to 2002 and we have to support him in whatever decision he wants to make
5264 id like to think professionally we offered him everything that he wanted but i know he has his son involved in the chicago blackhawks if you ever get a chance to work with your family thats special
5265 he took us from being a talented team to being a championship team he got slava fetisov and igor larionov to come here and he put the russian five sergei fedorov larionov slava kozlov fetisov and vladimir konstantinov together hes the one who transformed steve yzerman from a great offensive player to a great two way player
5266 even when we made a good decision one we felt really good about it was nice to have that experienced voice say yeah i like that move
5267 i think his experience is the thing were going to miss the most id like to think that scotty was happy here in his role as a consultant i know i liked having him here we did a lot of winning and we had a lot of fun when he stepped down as coach he was a lot more relaxed and he was just a joy to be around
5268 this decision was precipitated by an unexpected and in our opinion unwarranted and unjustified act by our syndicate of banks which deprived us of the cash we needed to sustain and to continue those operations
5269 to ensure that all escrows are safe and all closings through the arizona texas and california offices will take place
5270 we have a lot of closings that are supposed to occur

5272 essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening
5273 i believe that this is the appropriate outcome to a horrific case
5274 likely confined for life in a state mental health facility

5279 e posibil sa fi fost intimplator e foarte obisnuit sa alegi o specializare la moda aceasta preferinta a candidatilor pentru specializarea relatii internationale si studii europene dar si pentru stiinte ale comunicarii se inregistreaza insa la nivel national
5280 este vorba de dorinta candidatilor de a obtine un loc de munca in domenii foarte atractive
5281 ne propunem sa invitam chiar elevii la diverse simpozionae conferinte sau sa colaboram impreuna pentru anumite proiecte
5282 desi se promoveaza ideea de inflatie de juristi nu cred ca este adevarat societatea are nevoie de juristi bine pregatiti pe toate palierele activitatii sociale la nivel juridic public sau privat explicatiile pentru care studentii se indreapta spre drept pot tine de mobilitatea profesiei in ocuparea diferitelor functii dar si pentru ca juristii bine pregatiti sunt si bine recompensati
5283 avem citiva ani la rind de cind nu ocupam toate locurile aceasta pentru ca noi avem specializari care cer foarte multa pregatire si pentru ca cei mai buni absolventi de liceu cu rezultate foarte bune la fizica nu ramin in tara trebuie gindit un pic asupra alocarii locurilor la buget pe domenii la noi nu prea sint absolventi cu diploma fara servici
5284 la noi este o practica biologica foarte tentanta pe teren pe care absolventii facultatii o promoveaza la rindul lor iar apoi exista o gama mai larga de locuri de munca comparativ cu matematica sau fizica
5285 poate ca unii nu se simt pregatiti sa faca fata unui concurs unde nu se poate trisa iar pe de alta parte desi sint pregatiti nu vin aici tocmai pentru ca se da examen de admitere sint candidati care dupa examenul de bacalaureat se simt foarte obositi si prefera varianta mai simpla a concursului de dosare
5286 din pacate modul in care se realizeaza finantarea invatamintului ne impinge catre aceasta varianta desi exista o cerere mult prea mare pe piata pe care nu o putem acoperi
5287 in acest an a crescut concurenta la facultatea de constructii si instalatii ca urmare a cresterii ritmului constructiilor la nivel national dar si la hidrotehnica geodezie si protectia mediului datorita celor doua directii foarte cautate geodezia si protectia mediului a crescut in acest an si concurenta la facultatea de inginerie chimica si protectia mediului datorita noii specializari inginerie alimentara
5288 la facultatea de textile numarul celor care vin sa se inscrie este in scadere ca urmare a falimentarii celor mai multe intreprinderi de profil din zona
5289 ca valoare globala a mediilor pe universitate aceasta a crescut s a ridicat nivelul ultimelor medii pe locurile fara taxa tendinta din punct de vedere cantitativ se mentine aproximativ la fel ca si in anii trecuti dar calitativ este in crestere
5290 la farmacie se mentine in continuare aceeasi cocurenta pentru ca absolventii si gasesc imediat dupa terminarea studiilor un loc de munca la fel si la medicina dentara
5291 in continuare este concurenta mare la marketing si drept desi piata nu mai poate absorbi noi trebuie sa pastram locurile la presiunea pe care o avem
5292 12 cetateni ai uniunii europene de exemplu au dat chiar si examen de admitere pentru locurile fara taxa
5293 piata muncii pentru prelucrarea produselor agricole este foarte dezvoltata in romania dar este si un domeniu relativ nou doar citeva centre universitare pregatesc aceasta specializare poate trebuia sa avem chiar mai multi candidati avind in vedere ca oferim specializari de care romania nu se poate lipsi si comparativ cu nevoia de specialisti in domeniul agricol
5294 din spusele cadrelor didactice s a realizat un progres in pregatirea elevilor care vin la noi dar ne am fi asteptat la o pregatire mai solida a cunostintelor in rindul stiintelor la chimie sau la biologie
5295 am constatat ca de obicei cele mai multe cereri de concedii fara plata se depun in perioada august septembrie a fiecarui an

5317 they want skill to play a factor in every single shot and if you have rough like you have out here today it takes a lot of skill to maneuver a ball on the green when youve got trees in front of you but you can do it if you hit a really good shot i think the players really like what they see here
5318 this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour

5328 a modern retail award must reflect the modern retail market which requires flexibility and the current award is structured around fixed trading conditions
5329 the aras recommendations recognise full time employees supporting the continuation of penalty rates within the context of a seven day 24 hour trade period
5330 the previous award was focused on the regulated market of monday to friday working weeks the aras submission also draws upon employee benefit schemes from other sectors to be incorporated in a modern retail award such as salary sacrificing for superannuation and other modern day needs
5331 consumers drive labour rates within retailing and it is imperative retailers have the flexibility required to meet modern consumer demand however the ara does not support rogue retailers who dont respect their staff or their compliance requirements and our submission maintains adequate protection for employees within the modern retail award

5391 mai ales in interesul cetatenilor romani c e ar fi trebuit sa aiba curajul sa i numeasca in clar pe cei responsabili din punct de vedere politic pentru deficientele din domeniul justitiei si al luptei anti coruptie si sa aplice ca si in cazul bulgariei sanctiuni pe masura
5392 niciodata pina acum nu s a aflat vreun politician american in rol de candidat la presedintie in germania nu doar prezenta lui obama la coloana victoriei ci si convorbirile sale cu angela merkel si frank walter steinmeier ministrul de externe m a reprezinta o premiera cel putin in ce priveste sediul guvernului german
5393 cred c ar trebui sa ne bucuram ca vine un american impotriva caruia nu trebuie sa demonstrezi
5394 obama nu i un sfint si nimeni n ar trebui sa se astepte la minuni
5395 obama n are o parere foarte progresista nici in privinta pedepsei cu moartea nici in privinta posesiei de arme si a politicii de sanatate
5396 candidatul sau oricare alt candidat va fi ales presedinte bun venit din inima in fata portii brandenburg
5397 ati spus mereu ca zvonurile precum ca ati fi musulman n ar avea nimic de a face cu comunitatea islamica multi se ntreaba insa de ce nu merge in cazul acesta nici macar o data intr o moschee in discursul dumneavoastra de la berlin ati cerut darimarea zidurilor dintre musulmani crestini si evrei atunci de ce nu va duceti intr o moschee
5398 ei candy nu pot sa le fac pe toate am facut cit de mult a fost posibil saptamina asta ramine cum am spus am cel mai mare respect pentru comunitatea religioasa musulmana unul din lucrurile pe care l as face anul viitor ca presedinte ar fi sa convoc o conferinta a tarilor islamice astfel ar putea fi deconstruite suspiciunea si neincrederea care s au adunat intre statele unite si lumea islamica avem nevoie de ajutorul tuturor oamenilor in special de cel din partea musulmanilor de buna credinta
5399 in calitate de presedinte al comisiei finante si banci din senat ar fi contribuit semnificativ la votarea unei legi inasprite de interzicere a investitiilor in iran faptul ca obama nu e nici macar membru al acelei comisii n a fost mentionat decit de niscaiva bloggeri si citeva ziare imaginile tv au fost mult prea frumoase mai ales acelea de la berlin
5400 sa se arate celor de acasa cind actualul presedinte vorbeste n strainatate oamenii protesteaza ma rog nu si n romania m a cind vorbeste obama jubileaza era de asteptat sa se ntimple asta la berlin nu in ultimul rind pentru ca relatia foarte emotionala dintre germani si americani se densifica aici berlinul este cutia de rezonanta a unor semnificatii istorice ca loc a doua mari victorii ale americanilor asupra nazistilor si asupra sovieticilor berlinul este un cod un loc pe care cu greu il mai gasesti unde amestecul american in afacerile restului lumii este privit ca ceva binecuvintat
5401 reverend wright is not the man i thought i knew
5402 mccains ideology resembles an exotic cocktail of teddy roosevelt barry goldwater and ronald reagan

5404 and ye will not suffer allow your children that they go hungry or naked neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of god and fight and quarrel one with another and serve the devil who is that master of sin or who is the evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers he being an enemy to all righteousness but ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness ye will teach them to love one another and to serve one another

5474 state and local agencies save and recover billions for consumers every year but its difficult for them to keep up with the demand to stop marketplace abuses resolve individual complaints and educate people to avoid rip offs
5475 in economic hard times consumers are even more vulnerable to phony promises to help them financially or money making schemes
5476 state and local consumer protection agencies are the first responders whether its a man made disaster such as the mortgage crisis or a natural disaster like a hurricane or wildfires
5477 in addition to having to be experts in everything from auto repairs to gem stone grading state and local consumer agencies also need expertise to deal with the evolving nature of fraud especially online

5489 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
5490 i never took the time to know him but he seemed to be ok right just a kid
5491 he just said he was going to winnipeg going home thats where he was from
5492 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
5493 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it
5494 it looked kind of like a scuffle or an argument you know and then somebodys like knife knife run so i was running up the alleyway slapping people telling them to get going move get off the bus i got pushed over some lady got pushed over i was just making sure everybody was ok and we all got off the bus
5495 the attacker was over top of the victim continually cutting him i think the victim was gone at that point
5496 when we came back on the bus it was visible at the end of the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
5497 while we were watching the door he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
5498 they did an awesome thing holding him in there because if not what would have happened
5499 it was like he was at the beach or something there was no rage in him he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
5500 while we were waiting on the side of the road the attacker was taunting the police with the head in his hand
5501 i closed my eyes and i seen him in the window there just like a madman
5502 when you see something as horrifying as that the brain locks on to those images its very difficult to release those images
5503 the assistance that people will get will be along the lines of coping in the immediate phase learning what to do to reduce the profound effect this experience will have
5504 they will experience very very vivid flashbacks of that occurrence those will usually dissipate over a period of time but right now its going to be very vivid as theyre still dealing with the shock and processing this horrific event
5505 theres not a right or wrong way to go through this some people will still be in shock and being very flat in presentation like nothings happened other people may not get out of bed and not want to move for a while or be having what we call very acute responses so theyll be maybe crying and not wanting to calm down at all everybodys going to go through this very difficult journey in a very different way
5506 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
5507 i can assure people that everything is in full motion and momentum to getting to the bottom of this incident
5508 all we can do is physically observe the individuals behaviour but obviously the item of destruction got on the bus somehow and if it was visible to any driver he would not have boarded the bus just for that simple reason
5509 there has to be some reactive measures taken whether it be metal screening or whether we design differently our loading policies at various depots so you have to funnel down a chute as your only way onto the bus at major terminals i really believe now we have to do something not only that we have to be investigating carry on luggage and certain things like that
5510 we are working with transport canada to review inter city bus security
5511 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical for bus travel its just a completely different system

5533 from the 17th of tamuz the tzaros of the churban started so the custom is to comport oneself a little like a mourner
5534 may hashem help us to weep and mourn the destruction of the beis hamikdash which principally means that we should mourn because of our sins that prevent the rebuilding of the beis hamikdash until we merit to change our agony and sighing into the happiness and joy of trust in hashems kindness and great deliverance until everything turns into good
5535 i will give you a big sum of money if you can find even one bochur who believes that it is possible to come to the level whereby one can go an entire year without sins i am not talking about trying to accept upon ourselves to go a year without sin quite the contrary kabalos have to be exclusively small but we must at least believe that this is possible after much introspection and toil i am not even talking about coming to gadlus which is a much greater level i am talking about entering into our heads and hearts the genuine belief that it is possible to rid ourselves of all sin this emunah is a prerequisite of true teshuvah which consists of charata of the past and acceptance for the future
5536 dehumanization which marks not only those whose humanity has been stolen but also though in a different way those who have stolen it is a you
5537 its been a big issue online but for the most part the response weve gotten has been very positive weve got petitions a few people on forums who are very loud but its really more of the squeaky wheel syndrome
5538 certainly internally theres no doubt i would tell people who dont like the art style that probably getting the art style was the hardest thing
5539 diablo is a game you play for hopefully hundreds of hours and one of the rewards is a variety of different looking environments
5540 people remember the act i dungeons but they kind of conveniently forget the green fields of act i and all of act ii and its palaces its bright deserts
5541 we had all kinds of problems with identification of units combat wasnt very good and the worlds got homogeneous very quickly as we played through it we didnt like it or think it was very much fun
5542 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
5543 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
5544 if you do follow those rules theres going to be some similarities
5545 we dont say oh we dont want to do anything those games did its all blizzard were all a family wow pulled stuff from diablo ii if we think its a smart choice we try to pull stuff from them we dont really worry about whether its different what matters is does it make the gameplay better that always wins
5546 diablo can do a lot of things wow cant even do
5547 we cant do the level of violence that they can do in diablo iii we would lose our rating if we do the things that diablo iii does they have a much darker vibe
5548 if were actually making the game worse with no other reason than to be different from wow then its a bad choice we dont think when people play that theyll have any problem telling that its a different game
5549 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher

5612 i wish we could take credit for the number of deaths
5613 the writers damian shannon and mark swift after we had done everything said did you notice how many kills there were and we said yeah there are a lot they said actually there are 13 so the writers had figured that out
5614 we also show what jasons doing when hes not killing
5615 hes just great on it and people didnt know that its fun to watch
5616 our character has been rejected hes pulled away from society he wants to live by himself and all of a sudden these kids come into his area and disrespect his area and he has nowhere to go hes like a caged animal with his back against the wall and he albeit in a bad way protects himself
5617 my knees got pretty damaged i had some bad knee problems afterwards and it took me about four weeks to really recover from it it definitely isnt as campy as the original friday the 13th movies they were what they were for their day but when you look at them now you dont get as creeped out its a different feel i think the audiences are demanding a little bit more of horror movies now so ours is a lot of blood and guts and weapons and stuff like that
5618 ive been doing the character background the victimization of jason since he was abused as a child he was always the outcast
5619 he was always shunned by society so ive taken the stance that its almost like a vietnam flashback where someone has been victimized and abused so badly that when things resurface and these kids start to encroach on his area he is once again having a flashback its a moment so intense that hes getting his revenge for when he saw his mother get murdered hes still in the moment like these people just recently murdered his mother and hes having his revenge

5625 the concept is to bring all the people together as one person linking as one world at the state of where the world is now with all these wars and conflict all over the place i think a record like that is needed thats the best time when a voice needs to be heard i felt like what better voice between me and mike to be able to say something like that at the time we in outside of trying to do a club record or a record we expect to get thousand of spins it was more so lets do a record that fits all formats but also has some meaning to it but of course for the future well be finishing up the rest of the record
5626 were gonna set up a whole tour around it its a big play
5627 she was mad cool down to earth yet conservative polite she felt like a high school friend she felt mad approachable cool as hell we had a great time working the chemistry was right on point the record shows it because we came up with a smash

5631 she really aint actually we switched some words around so people dont think she was singing about bobby this record is more of a record that anyone going through that situation would be able to relate to its just the fact that she got out of a situation is what made it more relevant im doing two records for her album

5634 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
5635 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
5636 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
5637 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun

5656 diablo is a game you play for hopefully hundreds of hours and one of the rewards is a variety of different looking environments

5658 we had all kinds of problems with identification of units combat wasnt very good and the worlds got homogeneous very quickly as we played through it we didnt like it or think it was very much fun
5659 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
5660 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
5661 if you do follow those rules theres going to be some similarities
5662 we dont say oh we dont want to do anything those games did its all blizzard were all a family wow pulled stuff from diablo ii if we think its a smart choice we try to pull stuff from them we dont really worry about whether its different what matters is does it make the gameplay better that always wins
5663 diablo can do a lot of things wow cant even do
5664 we cant do the level of violence that they can do in diablo iii we would lose our rating if we do the things that diablo iii does they have a much darker vibe
5665 if were actually making the game worse with no other reason than to be different from wow then its a bad choice we dont think when people play that theyll have any problem telling that its a different game
5666 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher

5781 roosevelts guitar style is one of the most subtle to be found on records with its delicate touch and rhythmic shifts he often extends his guitar lines beyond the expected standard patterns to produce greater variety
5782 this style of guitar playing with its subtle rhythm shifts between duple and triple patterns is a splendid example of the type of music then current in jackson

5800 two years have gone by and they have not made a very good effort to get this resolved
5801 they have said if we dont sign the lease agreement according to their terms and conditions they wont provide services to the adjacent property theres about 15 acres there for development they shouldnt be doing that
5802 its not something we look forward to but if we cant come to an agreement thats what we would have to do there are other businesses that have lease agreements with the city that are surrounding the airport it would impact them as well
5803 i dont know where this has come from or why but weve had discussions with edmund gus the okanagan indian band administrator this morning and im hopeful everything will get resolved
5804 weve had agreements in place up until about 18 months ago were still happy with the original deal and weve been paying as if we were working with the new agreement
5805 anything is possible it would still be an airport but essentially it would restrict the use of what could go in there no airplanes could land but we have businesses that have helicopters so it would be a large helipad i guess

5811 if it became a tradition that small children were never subjected to complete or prolonged separation from their parents in the same way that regular sleep and orange juice have become nursery traditions i believe that many cases of neurotic character development would be avoided

5828 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
5829 common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen
5830 science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn ones living at it
5831 the secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources
5832 the only thing that interferes with my learning is my education
5833 god does not care about our mathematical difficulties he integrates empirically
5834 the whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking

5836 peace cannot be kept by force it can only be achieved by understanding
5837 the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible

5839 education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school
5840 the important thing is not to stop questioning curiosity has its own reason for existing
5841 do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics i can assure you mine are still greater
5842 equations are more important to me because politics is for the present but an equation is something for eternity
5843 if a is a success in life then a equals x plus y plus z work is x y is play and z is keeping your mouth shut
5844 two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the the universe
5845 as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality

5848 in order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must above all be a sheep
5849 the fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears for theres no risk of accident for someone whos dead
5850 too many of us look upon americans as dollar chasers this is a cruel libel even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the americans themselves
5851 heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism how passionately i hate them
5852 no this trick wont work how on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love
5853 my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind
5854 yes we have to divide up our time like that between our politics and our equations but to me our equations are far more important for politics are only a matter of present concern a mathematical equation stands forever
5855 the release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind if only i had known i should have become a watchmaker
5856 great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities the latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence
5857 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed
5858 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would indeeded be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
5859 the further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life and the fear of death and blind faith but through striving after rational knowledge

5862 one had to cram all this stuff into ones mind for the examinations whether one liked it or not this coercion had such a deterring effect on me that after i had passed the final examination i found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year
5863 one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness from the fetters of ones own ever shifting desires a finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought
5864 he who joyfully marches to music rank and file has already earned my contempt he has been given a large brain by mistake since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice this disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once heroism at command how violently i hate all this how despicable and ignoble war is i would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action it is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder
5865 a human being is a part of a whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty

5867 if you semiretire at age 62 and if youre taking social security benefits that is money you dont have to pull from retirement assets

5890 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil

5903 coral cover will decrease to less than five percent on most reefs by the middle of the century under even the most favourable assumptions

5906 do everything in his power to repatriate canadian guantanamo bay detainee omar khadr to canada where his rights as a canadian citizen will be respected
5907 constitutes a violation of the fundamental principles of the rule of law including arbitrary and illegal detention denial of procedural due process denial of the right to counsel and denial of the right to trial within a reasonable time before a fair and impartial tribunal
5908 by refusing to intervene to uphold principles of fundamental justice in the omar khadr case you have signaled that canada now consents to its citizens being tried for retroactively designated crimes on the basis of secret evidence on the basis of testimony extracted under torture and that canada no longer supports the presumption of innocence

5919 thats one of the things that distinguishes it from other music and its a particular style of playing the guitar its sort of arpeggiated picking rather than strumming
5920 it absolutely has i think in terms of structurally the kind of folks who were making it people on the margins of society this was the blues in some way its a little more cheerful though than the blues even songs where theyre singing about the treachery of a woman if you just listen to them musically they still sound kind of sweet

6167 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
6168 i dont know what to take out of this match
6169 theres always going to be a nothing match these type of matches what are you going to do i just tried to serve well
6170 it wasnt an olympics or a us open so i can live with that
6171 maybe i got a little bit unlucky on a couple but he definitely served well in the last tiebreaker when i had three chances on second serves i wasnt able to get one when i really needed to be on even terms with him
6172 i guess that cost me the match which is hard to accept
6173 hes doing well and i have done well in the past as well
6174 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the us open
6175 i havent played against top 10 players so much in my career so beating one of them gives me more confidence

6197 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
6198 im disappointed that sen obama would say the things hes saying
6199 the falsehoods that the mccain campaign is putting out there
6200 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6201 damu has been training for years for this moment and shes prepared
6202 throughout that whole experience i got three olympic medals a gold a silver and a bronze
6203 its 10 times worse for me as a coach than it has ever been as an athlete
6204 as an athlete i felt like i was in control of everything but as a coach im totally out of the frame when it comes to that i dont know whats going to happen after the gun goes off its uncomfortable
6205 hes really really tough but you need that if youre going to compete on a world class level
6206 i think if it wasnt for him i wouldnt be here
6207 if you only walk away with being an olympian that is something that never goes away so whether you walk away with or without a medal that label is gold within itself
6208 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
6209 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
6210 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
6211 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
6212 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
6213 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
6214 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
6215 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6216 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
6217 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
6218 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
6219 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
6220 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
6221 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
6222 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama

6261 this was just a name which has since been changed to
6262 a massive performance based efficiency program for homes commercial buildings and new construction and a massive effort to boost the efficiency of heavy industry and expand the use of cogeneration c apture the co2 from 800 new large coal plants and store it underground b uild 1 million large wind turbines and b uild 700 new large nuclear power plants
6263 whereas the first third of romms book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the u s public is being misled by a federal government backed by conservative political forces that is intent on inaction and thats also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions
6264 convincingly shoots down the arguments of those who claim global warming is a hoax or some kind of natural cycle not associated with human activities
6265 denyers and delayers are winning the political battle in the united states the worlds highest emitter of hell and high water is a great book for people who want to understand the complexities of global warming and perhaps more important what we could be doing about it other than wringing our hands or sticking our collective head in the sand
6266 his book provides an accurate summary of what is known about global warming and climate change a sensible agenda for technology and policy and a primer on how political disinformation has undermined climate science
6267 it seemed every paragraph every page revealed some new outrage that just got my dander up if it doesnt do the same to you ill really be surprised
6268 i referred to the book as depressing but the tone is frank not truly gloomy romm is known as a level headed optimistic analyst his book is no exception he documents the problem and the quite mainstream solutions he endorses thoroughly and meticulously
6269 anyone who thinks liberal propaganda when they hear that assertion needs to read joseph romms just out book hell and high water its well documented hard to refute and scary
6270 hell and high water might be the global warming work of most interest to the politically engaged democratic and or republican romm lays a strong case as to how global warming could be the death sentence for the republican party as reality becomes ever blatantly at odds with republican party rhetoric romm also highlights how in an ever more difficult world in the years to come either the united states figures out how to lead in dealing with mitigating muting global warming and its impacts or risks becoming a pariah nation with dire implications for the republic and its citizens
6271 the health and well being of this nation and the world romm explains that we already possess the technologies and know how we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
6272 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
6273 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
6274 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
6275 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
6276 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
6277 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
6278 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
6279 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible

6489 india has over 1 billion people it is clearly a country out of balance in terms of its population size
6490 the roman catholic countries will not have a rough time except for the population problem the roman catholics already have three gods in one so accepting others is not that much of a stretch the dividing point is going to be the containment of population the protestant countries will deal fairly easily with contact so will countries with indigenous religions connected to nature the muslim hindu and fundamentalist christian religions will have the most difficult time possibly even the elimination of said religions we can expect mass suicides social unrest and upheaval the ets will help with re programming and the concept of an inclusive galactic order however society will have to step up to the plate to assist one on one those people who have shattered belief systems the chinese will have no problem because of the buddhist and taoist influences

6919 ive talked to a number of coaches who are friends of mine and being good is almost a curse sometimes
6920 they say were not coming up there youre too good its a compliment to joe but its hard to schedule
6921 its not the most important part its more important how you coach and how you teach and how you practice and your recruiting is more important
6922 but theres nothing harder than scheduling no one wants to come to the gallagher center no one wants to come to buffalo its a hard thing to put it all together
6923 this car doesnt have a carbon footprint more of a crater

6926 right now its about being consistent and challenging for the championship youre going to win some years and lose some years but hopefully we can string together some good years and get us a championship
6927 the no 1 thing that sticks out that i love is six home games weve got a great opportunity for people here in the city of buffalo and our community to really come together and watch some division i football and be proud of their football team we have a product that i think people want to enjoy and its going to be entertaining both offensively and defensively
6928 drew is ready im proud with what hes already accomplished and still the work is not done he can still get better and improve in every aspect the biggest thing i saw him improve on last year was his leadership skills that was something that had to improve because the physical skills i felt very confident that they were going to improve hes shown leadership on both sides offense and defense and that carries a lot of weight
6929 it might a little bit particularly at the beginning of the year once you get to five or six games into the season youre in the mix and youre battling pretty good there early in the season we may be a little limited and not as wide in your calls you have to simplify and make sure all your techniques are down but we have speed at that position some of the technique might not be there but we hope to overcome that with the speed i can sit here and say we have a faster football team
6930 its been awesome not only for me having another head coach on the staff but having him as our quarterbacks coach brandon said
6931 hes a great teacher of football he doesnt have to worry so much about overseeing an offense and running a program and he can just teach and coach the quarterbacks
6932 i had an up and down game i wanted to let the game come to me things didnt come to me as soon as i wanted to so i kind of started forcing things and i know better than that but then i think i played pretty well first and foremost we got a win
6933 hes definitely a good decision maker youre not going to take the ball from him and he shoots the open shot

6957 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
6958 were not in the habit of reacting every time they put out a statement
6959 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
6960 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
6961 this is a potentially risky comment to make for a campaign already under increasing criticism for some of the claims its made over the past week
6962 talk about the race card and injection of it into the debate can result in a negative backlash you can ask the clinton campaign about that
6963 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
6964 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
6965 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6966 thats a definition of madness but thats what john mccain is offering hes offering bush economic policies and karl rove politics
6967 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid
6968 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6969 these anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day

6988 there is a concern within this administration which i support that the imposition of a carbon cap in this country would may lead to the transfer of jobs and industry abroad to nations that do not have such a carbon cap
6989 you would then have the us economy damaged on the one hand and the same emissions potentially even worse emissions
6990 clearly the insiders from oil and gas believe that the governors office will persuade the texas natural resource conservation commission to accept what program is developed between the industry group and the governors office
6991 and two years later this joke of a program was enacted into law by a bill written by the general counsel for the texas chemical council who also lobbies for energy and utility companies the bill was denounced by newspapers across the state
6992 safe clean and reliable and for the foreseeable future it is the only mature emissions free technology that can supply the power america will need to meet the projected increase in demand for electricity over the next 25 years this is one of the reasons we have put so much emphasis on bringing about a nuclear renaissance here in the united states
6993 the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as a major component of our national energy policy
6994 we have an opportunity to increase our supplies of electricity to meet projected demand over the next two decades america must have in place between 1 300 and 1 900 new electric plants much of this new generation will be fueled by natural gas however existing and new technologies offer us the opportunity to expand nuclear generation as well nuclear power today accounts for 20 percent of our countrys electricity this power source which causes no greenhouse gas emissions can play an expanding part in our energy future

6996 ive been empty since arizona i turned my back on me and i faced the face of who i thought i was
6997 thats the nice thing about getting back home and talking to people often someone comes up with a good idea
6998 its fun when you hear a good one and can build legislation from it
6999 i talked to him and pointed out the fact that the 25 bed cap sometimes keeps vets from getting care at local hospitals i told him my idea for exempting beds he said it was a marvelous idea and to go ahead with it
7000 i had worked with walden when he was in the state legislature i knew if he realized there was a problem for veterans hed act on it
7001 it is a bipartisan bill and the sponsors are members of key committees
7002 it makes logical sense it would benefit local veterans and wouldnt cost much
7003 hes been a real bird dog on this weve got a bill drafted that has wide support
7004 it tends to happen seasonally at times when we have admitted a lot of patients with flu or pneumonia we transfer about 20 people a year because of the cap
7005 under current law veterans requiring urgent care might not be able to receive it from their local rural hospitals
7006 that makes no sense veterans deserve the best care we can possibly give them
7007 i thank him for leading the effort to make sure veterans are treated like people and not numbers that can be literally shuffled around the state to balance a bureaucratic worksheet
7008 i still have a lot of local apples from a farmer that gave them to us from his personal supply bless his heart
7009 thank the lord the kids had just come up on the porch they had just been riding their bicycles out on the sidewalk
7010 there has been at least one killed in wallowa and at least one in lostine the last 10 years or so its unusual to see cougars in towns but it happens
7011 its not unusual to see cougars in the wallowa valley a populated rural area
7012 and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
7013 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

7016 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims but after the pressure we applied libya can finally be held accountable for these devastating events
7017 now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
7018 it will allow them the fair and just compensation that theyve been seeking in an expeditious manner
7019 allow the united states and libya to finally close the book on a contentious period in our relationship and to look to the future
7020 after 20 years of waiting the legislation is a final step toward resolving the last payment by libya
7021 any settlements by other victims should not be at the expense of those who have fought and won in the courts
7022 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
7023 edf will hold its half year results meeting as planned
7024 the president made very clear that he would use this 45 day period to assess the dprks north koreas cooperation including on reaching agreement on a verification protocol and respond accordingly
7025 a little more than 10 days left before the first opportunity for the president to open that window and de list the north
7026 i will say that without this action which we hope the north will take the de listing will not occur on that time line
7027 agree to a verification protocol that included the plutonium program the highly enriched uranium activities and the proliferation efforts
7028 if verification must cover the three big issues that certainly makes it more difficult than if you only focus on plutonium
7029 it made everything a little easier knowing i was going to the shriners hospital thats where you get the best of the best
7030 there were a couple of girls who missed the previous season with injuries
7031 i know its because of where i went the doctors did a great job and delivered more than what we had planned
7032 all i could think about was the opportunity to represent the people that helped me
7033 it was weird to go in without needing to see the doctor
7034 i was able to show everyone where to go all the people i met while being a patient were so happy for me
7035 its so humbling to spend time with the kids at the hospital
7036 even after being a patient there i didnt know what to expect or how the football players would interact with the kids
7037 it was great to see the football players take to the kids they talked with them and signed footballs
7038 im looking forward to it and im not all at the same time
7039 the stands will be full and people watching on television
7040 ill just do my best to do something i cant do put into words how thankful i am to the shriners
7041 make no mistake about it we are gravely concerned about allegations of a sexual assault at a campus residence hall allegations that university officials withheld information from the regents and other iowans and that the universitys procedures and timelines were not followed as well as reports of an attempted cover up by the university of iowa
7042 if at any time you believe that you are not receiving the full cooperation of university of iowa employees and others we encourage you to contact us immediately so that we can exercise our option to seek subpoena powers and bring witnesses before the oversight committee in a timely manner to ensure a full and open investigation
7043 will not hesitate to turn to the joint oversight committee if for any reason during the course of the investigation their assistance becomes necessary
7044 we look forward to meeting with the joint oversight committee to review the results of the investigation and any subsequent recommendations and we thank them once again for their support
7045 some institutions really are too big to fail and thats the way it is
7046 they are going to raise the cost of living for every american
7047 the government is debasing the value of our money freddie and fannie need to fail they are too big to save
7048 foreigners are not charitable organizations and theyre going to demand that we pay them back
7049 foreigners could decide its just not worth the risk and sell
7050 the really dire scenarios have become a lot more likely than they were a year or two ago
7051 they dont want the us to go into the worst downturn since the depression
7052 in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican
7053 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program
7054 i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family
7055 i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions i am looking forward to putting this behind me and getting on the practice field with my teammates on saturday
7056 there is only one happiness in life to love amp be loved
7057 if youre at risk of alzheimers because your mother had the disease you need to make sure that you take special care of your health
7058 if you had a baseline brain scan and then a follow up five years later and it showed that your glucose utilization was falling off rapidly and in a pattern consistent with alzheimers disease that would be of concern
7059 its certainly plausible that if one inherits faulty mitochondria that might put you at increased risk for alzheimers
7060 it may be that decreased glucose utilization doesnt necessarily mean youre going to get alzheimers disease but that in conjunction with the wrong type of environment or some other genes that might give you a slight risk would combine to give it to you
7061 but in a lot of people it probably is just another insult another hit in a biological boxing match
7062 those things are all good for you anyway and until we have a pill that we can recommend for people those are the sorts of recommendations that were able to offer
7063 there could be a paternal transmission factor but we dont really know what it is
7064 people have said to me from the day that i took this job they said look its the worst job in australia in politics
7065 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
7066 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election
7067 this is a logical extension and important part of our strategy to further increase recurring earnings in our sugar business and improve our renewable energy capability
7068 this project further enhances our ability to meet the exponential growth in the fuel ethanol market
7069 i think the banks will be under huge pressure in the market place to act in response to official interest rate changes
7070 operating in the market these banks have a responsibility to act despite recent adjustments both by the nab and by anz in response to some bad decisions lending decisions made in the past
7071 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
7072 this is a chance for skilled and experienced executives to bring a fresh perspective in their new portfolio areas
7073 these changes along with the cabinet reshuffle announced last week will mark a regeneration in government while maintaining a high level of experience and expertise across portfolios for the benefit of all south australians
7074 we have the highest expectations of these executives and all other executives to deliver on key performance indicators and importantly on targets in our strategic plan
7075 the folau try was probably what brought it all on
7076 a lot of people in afl have been saying it should have happened a long time and i think you saw the first glimpse of it with the folau try
7077 if tries like folaus keep happening im sure rugby league will look to have aerial coaches fulltime to give players advice
7078 we didnt talk about taking the ball overhead or on their chest thats a skill that has to be learned over time
7079 it was more how to position themselves in that aerial contest and where to put themselves to give them the best chance
7080 if they dont win the contest at least make sure the other winger doesnt
7081 im sure the boys will get a lot out of the session with him
7082 when we come up against teams whove got tall wingers it will be good to have some professional advice
7083 the economy more generally is feeling the ongoing impacts of the reserve banks tightening of monetary policy as well as market based rate rises
7084 inventories were run down significantly suggesting continuing weaker demand and the potential for further falls in production
7085 manufacturers cited positive effects on activity from solid infrastructure and mining related demand
7086 the pressures flowing from slower market growth rising input costs and the ongoing strength in the australian dollar are a mix of both cyclical and long term factors affecting profit margins
7087 at this point im not ready to make that decision
7088 its not flat dead even like i said last week at sec media days hes got some ground to make up with his teammates and coaches
7089 wills been an outstanding young man and the circumstances of his arrest were a little iffy
7090 he shouldnt have been in the situation but it wasnt a situation that he started
7091 fidler and a friend who he was trying to warn that the other people involved were going to jump him two people got arrested one of the other four guys and will its kind of a bad deal he did get jumped and he did not start this incident he was trying to be a mediator
7092 i knew about will fidler the very morning after it happened
7093 thats what my players are informed to do rather than have me find out from other sources
7094 this team has been void of these kind of problems and im very very proud of that
7095 and i want to make sure that we keep a better image than what these two incidents bring to us for the most part weve been able to do that over the last several years im looking forward to getting back to a quieter time on these issues
7096 this will be a great example of any transgression will be met with not very popular publicity
7097 its kind of like if you got money in the bank
7098 you can only withdraw so much if you overdraw youve got a problem part of the deal about being a quarterback is obviously the visibility accountability and publicity
7099 you have to understand that youre a little different animal than the left tackle linebacker or safety all of those people are accountable but the quarterback is held at a different standard because he is a guy that you look for on the field for outstanding leadership
7100 id always been a jay z fan and this was his comeback video so that was huge
7101 beyonce was there it was the first time id met dale jr it was really cool
7102 i still have the same nerves before every race that i had before i won
7103 nothing has really changed in the way i feel i want to win races
7104 im very fortunate to be in the position where people are interested in what i do the more popular you get the more people who are watching what you do
7105 for anybody no matter what job you do there are appropriate times and places to approach co workers

7114 our review has not found any credible evidence that representatives from kbr were aware of imminent life threatening hazards in legion security forces building 1 at the radwaniyah palace complex prior to ssg maseths electrocution on january 2 2008
7115 though we cannot be certain who installed the water pump that killed maseth we do know that kbr did not do so
7116 truth and accuracy that are the bread and butter of the public relations profession
7117 if you have been misled by what i have told you over the months and years about there being free internet access during the games then i apologise
7118 we negotiated with bocog terms and conditions that would allow journalists access to the internet that was unimpeded and uncensored and would allow them to report on the games but not necessarily on games related activities or about what else happened elsewhere in china
7119 you are dealing with a communist country that has censorship you are getting what they say you can have

7139 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
7140 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
7141 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
7142 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure

7146 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
7147 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
7148 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really

7162 in the states remaining 80 counties which largely went unaffected by the welfare changes since they were rolled out medicaid rolls grew from 735 703 to 755 623 or 2 7 percent
7163 the poorest countries and most vulnerable citizens will suffer the most damaging setbacks even though they have contributed least to the problem
7164 climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time
7165 we believe that if the international community is going to seriously address the challenges of climate change then we need to get our priorities right in zimbabwe the effects of climate change have become more evident in the past decade as we have witnessed increased and recurrent droughts as well as occasional floods leading to enormous humanitarian challenges

7174 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
7175 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
7176 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
7177 it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy
7178 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
7179 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black

7183 its the beast i did not believe it until now
7184 happy because the world seems to be not as bad as i thought so far if it forced him to the courtroom sad because 100 000 people he killed are not watching this
7185 to negotiate an agreement with milosevic and two of karadzics henchmen that karadzic would quit as president of the serbian portion of bosnia and as head of his political party immediately and disappear from public life
7186 reluctantly signed that agreement without ever coming to the negotiations
7187 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
7188 his behavior was correct at the same time he wants to sabotage the proceedings
7189 there are indications that there were more people in the car at the time of the shooting which is the main focus of our inquiry
7190 i would like to reiterate that this is a murder inquiry and that anyone harbouring people related to this incident face very serious consequences
7191 creo que la gran bulla que se hizo con el recorte de 1 5 billones en el presupuesto de 2008 se volvi un alka seltzer que se diluy y no se ve esa misma t nica de austeridad reflejada en el presupuesto de 2009
7192 ser a deseable que hubiera sido un presupuesto de crecimiento real cero
7193 es muy optimista lograr el crecimiento sobre el cual se estructur el presupuesto nacional
7194 la bonanza de los ingresos p blicos se ha desperdiciado para construir un super vit antic clico en las cuentas presupuestales como se necesitaba
7195 con gran valor ha denunciado el ministro zuluaga y el llamado balance primario de las cuentas p blicas es de signo positivo
7196 it has had an absolutely profound effect upon his life
7197 he has committed so many offences against churches of the same denomination from which the order comes not to take property but simply to cause damage no doubt in response for the damage he was done as a young child
7198 this will make a sentence of imprisonment physically difficult and dangerous for the prisoner who is not in a position to stand up and defend himself
7199 your career and achievements within the order are dashed your lifes work is discredited your legacy is now that of a child abuser rather than a man who had considerable talents and gave them to the order over so many years
7200 weve taken this action as a prudent response to the current extraordinary market conditions that have resulted in higher than usual redemptions in the fund not matched by fresh investment
7201 because property is a long term investment and the assets are not immediately realisable these types of provisions are common to these types of funds to ensure that the interests of investors are protected during periods of market volatility
7202 in the current market where investors are looking to reduce their exposure to property investments we believe we are acting in the best interests of investors by temporarily suspending activity to preserve the quality of the fund
7203 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
7204 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all
7205 were not asking to run the investigation but theres an abundance of knowledge in the industry that can help protect public health
7206 the packers and brett favre are continuing their discussions the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
7207 the colour of obamas skin is no guarantee considering so many women behaved worse than men and so many blacks think like whites just as so many leftists proved to be worse warmongers than the right
7208 i guess until you face the challenge and youve come up short is when you really have to think deeply about what is going on there
7209 we thought we had done that pretty well but until you get into the heat of the battle i guess thats the big learning experience
7210 i think people are bedding down in these new tactics and this particular coaching group is in its fourth test match weve played under these laws and certainly we are learning about these laws just like the players are
7211 that puts a bit of extra edge on it a bit of extra stress i imagine
7212 weve put our best foot forward this week the guys have trained well theyre very focused theyve been very focused right through the six test matches weve played this year i couldnt have asked more from them
7213 we have to be smart about the way we play and we have to bring the physical side of things and the aggression if we want to get what we are after
7214 hes got the skill set to play there i talked to him before we finalised the selection about his feeling about playing on the wing as he hadnt played there for a wee while and he was very positive very upbeat about the opportunity i think hes got the mentality and the composure to do a good job
7215 were putting in place some policies which we think will work and theyve worked at those particularly hard and i think the guys feel good about that
7216 it means that some 98 000 pages of evidence which the state confiscated in raids on mr zumas homes and also those of his legal adviser at the time two of his legal advisers can be used as evidence against him in the corruption trial which is scheduled to get underway next week
7217 it flows out of the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser schabir sheik and it revolves around money that was said to have been solicited by zuma in order that he would intervene on behalf of a company bidding for parts of south africas arms deal
7218 on these particular matters yes but he will next week seek to have the entire case thrown out of court when his trial is due to begin in kwazulu natal province in pietermartizburg there are also other applications pending one in mauritius another in the united kingdom where he is seeking to have the release of documents to the national prosecuting authority blocked
7219 every conflict at some stage has to end up at the negotiating table and it is our assessment that the moment for negotiations is now
7220 whatever arrangements are made about positions and allocations it has to consider the will of the people
7221 what we as leaders should do to resolve that crisis
7222 when you meet for the first after 10 years there is always a tendency of feeling this one has got horns this one has spears and all that
7223 but im sure that you cant have one and a half hours of dinner shouting at each other
7224 it is about dealing with land hunger it is about dealing with an economic asset
7225 we have told ver di that we are open to any new discussions with them
7226 they have declined and said theyll only talk with us if we come with a new offer
7227 we made a really substantial offer to ver di and ver di decided to leave the table and abandon the talks
7228 we say come back were open to dialogue were open to discussion and we really ask ver di to come back to the table to negotiate again
7229 were pretty confident that we can enable the passengers to reach their destinations
7230 washington is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm
7231 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants
7232 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
7233 in every city in australia where you could drop in at lunch time and sew stitch knit collage paint read great craft books etc sewing machines and crafty arty supplies provided with fresh cupcakes and good tea and coffee on hand yeah that would be cool
7234 what mistakes have you made and what have you learned from them
7235 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
7236 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
7237 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
7238 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
7239 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
7240 its like a fishing net if you count just the space of the strings width thats small but if you open up a fishing net and count the area it covers thats much larger
7241 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
7242 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
7243 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
7244 ten billion dollars today will as from august 1 be revalued to one zimdollar dollar
7245 having icc language in the text sends the wrong message to a man who has presided over genocide
7246 it is likely that we will discuss this the deferral request again over the coming months
7247 but the focus now should be on renewing the unamid mandate and showing solid council support for what is a very different mission in the field
7248 we hope this resolution will get the broadest possible support

7251 this has been a month of encouraging news from iraq violence is down to its lowest levels since the spring of 2004 and were now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady
7252 significant reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge another is the increasing capability of the iraqi forces
7253 the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue our policy of return on success we now have brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units that were sent to iraq as part of the surge
7254 the last of these surge brigades returned home this month and later this year general david petraeus will present me his recommendations on future troop levels including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit
7255 caution that the progress is still reversible but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
7256 were also making progress in our discussion with prime minister malikis government on a strategic framework agreement
7257 taking the lead in combat operations against terrorists and extremists
7258 this week the iraqi government is launching a new offensive in parts of diyala province that contain some of few remaining safe havens in the country
7259 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
7260 the iraqi council of representatives has passed several major pieces of legislation this year and iraqi leaders are preparing for provincial elections
7261 if you could reduce these sensational attacks further i think you are almost approaching a level of normal or latent violence
7262 the fact that the levels of violence have come down so significantly and stayed down now for some two and a half months indicates there is a degree of durability

7284 it has been a tough adjustment to some of the guys but the guys have accepted me well it has been good
7285 as long as we go and play hard as we have done in the past two games we will be okay
7286 they are a very tough country to match up with because they can all shoot the ball and they can go to the basket

7308 it is hard to explain the emotion of the people i was privileged to spend time with to listen to their stories to listen to their understanding of what occurred over there
7309 we knew we had something to prove and we had to be better than the best
7310 the entire post was making bets that we wouldnt jump wed be too afraid the thing that inspired us was that this was the only black combat outfit then and it was an opportunity for black troops to enter something they could be proud of
7311 they feel like i have to go out there and go above and beyond in order to get their attention and respect
7312 you have to look past it you have no choice

7328 people have said to me from the day that i took this job they said look its the worst job in australia in politics
7329 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
7330 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election
7331 i think the banks will be under huge pressure in the market place to act in response to official interest rate changes
7332 operating in the market these banks have a responsibility to act despite recent adjustments both by the nab and by anz in response to some bad decisions lending decisions made in the past
7333 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
7334 we believe that when it comes to budget policy we have done the right thing it is the right course of action
7335 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
7336 if you start to have governments preaching to the reserve bank about particular levels of monetary policy at particular times it is not a good recipe for the long term future because then you have the monetary authorities subject to day to day political pressure
7337 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us sub prime
7338 we have had the further shock to the economy coming off the back of the global oil shock the biggest that weve seen since the 1970s
7339 the key challenge is that we have a course a pathway through this and thats got to be built on a strong approach to budget policy and a strong approach to long term economic reform so that we can come through this in better shape
7340 the big challenge is as you know getting the balance right between not having an economy which is plagued by high levels of inflation forcing interest rates up over the long term while at the same time ensuring enough activity continues to be generated in the economy
7341 we have got our fiscal settings as right as we can but it is going to be tough tough in the sense of the impact on peoples family budgets
7342 we have had inflation running at 16 year highs as of when we came into office that then flows into interest rates and we have had 12 of those on the trot going up
7343 that then affects the level of activity in the economy and that in turn affects ultimately employment

7346 it is probable that a press which maintains an intimate touch with the business currents of the nation is likely to be more reliable than it would be if it were a stranger to these influences after all the chief business of the american people is business they are profoundly concerned with buying selling investing and prospering in the world
7347 generally speaking the business of the american people is business
7348 as governor of massachusetts coolidge supported wages and hours legislation opposed child labor imposed economic controls during world war i favored safety measures in factories and even worker representation on corporate boards did he support these measures while president no because in the 1920s such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments
7349 i do not believe we can do much about it
7350 i do not choose to run for president in 1928
7351 if i take another term i will be in the white house till 1933 ten years in washington is longer than any other man has had it too long
7352 the presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them while we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish

7357 you can just cut to the chase and theres no pressure to have kids or get married women that age have more power more connections to me pairing up successful older women and struggling younger males makes sense it seems kind of natural

7379 the study highlights that traits that we typically ascribe to humans only can also be found in other seemingly simpler animals and that no consciousness or self awareness is needed for a behavior like deception to occur
7380 future studies will need to evaluate the potential for male mate choice copying and deception in natural populations because male mate choice copying cannot be evolutionarily stable if males always have an opportunity to deceive rivals
7381 the coast guard recommends taking all safety precautions necessary to remain safe while diving and to always have a dive partner
7382 initially the seals were guided to one of the brighter stars by a laser pointer and encouraged to swim towards it
7383 with a little practice the seals swam in the right direction 100 of the time
7384 seals might learn the position of the stars relative to foraging grounds during dawn and dusk when they can see both the stars and landmarks at the coast
7385 we investigators spent 20 years attempting to learn about these animals on the high seas and temperate ocean waters with only slow progress
7386 this work will be useful for marine resource managers and others who want to understand how leatherbacks spend their days in the new england region and beyond

7394 we did some market research and realized there was a solid demand for the classics so a light went off in my head
7395 the digital remasters look fantastic and its nice to see we can earn back some incremental revenues from content my mom and dad shot back in the 70s most of the videos have never been released online its kind of exciting actually and the soundtrack on these videos alone is worth the price of admission
7396 a lot of our members kept asking for my moms older sets in higher res format
7397 so i figured it would be a great addition to the classics site to re release those in waves as well and bring them up to modern standards the chromes have all been rescanned and we have a very talented photo prepper on staff whos giving them the same gleam of any modern digital photos ive seen im very happy with the results the best part is weve found dozens of sets never before released online i think suze classics will be a great way to check out how porn was made in the early days before digital cameras web and mass production changed the entire scene funny to think its new and interesting all over again

7469 republicans take our budget responsibility very seriously and are committed to reaching a budget agreement as soon as possible so state workers are fully paid for their service to california
7470 we are continuing to advocate for a responsible balanced budget that gets spending under control improves our economy and protects taxpayers
7471 the reality highlighted by the governors action is that californias budget process must be reformed it is the only way to avoid these types of drastic measures in the future
7472 it is an unwise and unfortunate move to cause economic strife to public servants and their families who are working hard and playing by the rules

7480 the text then changes depending on how we look at it there is an interesting analogy to this in the exotic worlds of subatomic physics and fractal geometry when scientists first began to measure the mass or charge of quantum particles they found something very strange if you looked at the quantum particle from a long distance it had a definite mass but if you looked a the particle from a microscopic distance as in a high energy accelerator the effective mass of the particle changed it might be either greater or smaller than its mass as seen from a long distance how can something as apparently fixed as mass change depending on whether we look at it from close up or from a distance

7525 i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
7526 i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
7527 ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
7528 i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it
7529 ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
7530 my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since

7535 i look back and i just feel i cheated myself
7536 sometimes i didnt prepare the way i should people have always told me zab if you were just in a little better shape nobody could beat you i cheated myself a lot i didnt get myself in great shape like i should have been but now im here
7537 i see a lot of great fighters in this game that only got one opportunity and you worry about that i know theres not too many more opportunities so the one that ive got im going to capitalize off of it
7538 i call myself lucky lefty no matter what happens i somehow come back and find myself at the top again
7539 not to downplay joshua clottey but i feel like ive been in the ring with more of the elite fighters more of the best fighters
7540 hes a methodical fighter very one dimensional hes never fought somebody like me
7541 i wait and wait for this fight and finally i have it
7542 its my time to be a champion its not zabs time anymore
7543 we started out hoping he would make one leg of the triple crown but he ran a couple of clunkers so we gave him some to regroup
7544 i always felt he would be at his best on turf his last two races were very impressive
7545 id always phone his room saying i was someone else from the front desk and there was a limo waiting in the front and hed go limousine because he could get riled up
7546 in every city it would be a different voice i loved his laugh i loved laughing with him he was just that type of guy he was a guys guy we had a lot of fun together
7547 leif couldve been one of these guys who constantly told you about his playing days or bragged about what he did
7548 if you looked at it leif pettersen was a terrific receiver in the league on wednesday night i saw tony gabriel out here and was remembering the catch people forget that was one of leifs greatest games and the commissioner gave him the game ball that day i knew leif a lot of years and he never told anybody that thats the kind of guy he was im really going to miss him
7549 leif was one of the most competitive people i have ever met
7550 he loved to win whether it be in golf or football
7551 the only thing he loved more than winning was his family i will really miss him
7552 leif was widely respected by his peers fans and the entire cfl community for his passion and commitment to the game he had the innate ability to make those around him feel welcome and appreciated all with a wonderful sense of humour
7553 he had his life in perspective thats the best thing i can say about him
7554 we all have an ego some ex players have a huge ego and their exploits grow but i think leifs didnt
7555 he understood who he was and why he played and was very thankful for the fact that he was able to stay in the league
7556 as a player and television commentator leif was an obvious talent a true professional
7557 but it was his quick smile and seemingly effortless style that added an undeniable touch of class to everything he did and in the process to our league our thoughts are with his loved ones
7558 i am deeply saddened by the passing of my teammate and friend leif pettersen i have memories of a young fun guy who was always a positive force on the team but more importantly great recent memories of a good friend who was continually kind and gracious in his support and happiness for the success of the riders it will not be the same going to toronto and leif isnt there to welcome us
7559 always an optimist he had an infectious attitude and demeanour and no one ever left a meeting or social occasion with him with anything but a smile and a positive outlook
7560 he was truly one of the good guys in the sports business
7561 leif has been a great friend to the ticats organization and on behalf of everybody within our organization i would like to extend our sympathies to all of the pettersen family

7569 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
7570 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
7571 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene
7572 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
7573 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
7574 his goal is to make his electric car so cheap so trivial that you wont even think of buying a gasoline car

7771 ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
7772 my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since
7773 i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
7774 i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
7775 ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
7776 i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it

7883 behind the doors the animals are mistreated and abused by hooks whips and electric prods we must deliver this message to the public by standing outside of the entrance of the circus and averting ringlings violence torwards animals
7884 this is where i climbed to the ceiling of the venue and hung upside down to air it up

7894 never was isle so little never was sea so lone but over the scud and the palm trees an english flag was flown
7895 there is nothing in american experience or in american political life or in our culture that suggests we want to use hard power but what we have found over the decades is that unless you do have hard power and here i think youre referring to military power then sometimes you are faced with situations that you cant deal with i mean it was not soft power that freed europe it was hard power and what followed immediately after hard power did the united states ask for dominion over a single nation in europe no soft power came in the marshall plan soft power came with american gis who put their weapons down once the war was over and helped all those nations rebuild we did the same thing in japan so our record of living our values and letting our values be an inspiration to others i think is clear and i dont think i have anything to be ashamed of or apologize for with respect to what america has done for the world we have gone forth from our shores repeatedly over the last hundred years and weve done this as recently as the last year in afghanistan and put wonderful young men and women at risk many of whom have lost their lives and we have asked for nothing except enough ground to bury them in and otherwise we have returned home to seek our own you know to seek our own lives in peace to live our own lives in peace but there comes a time when soft power or talking with evil will not work where unfortunately hard power is the only thing that works

7901 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
7902 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
7903 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
7904 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since

7908 the absolutely true diary of a part time indian was last years big ya book what i find so fascinating about that situation is that alexie published another book last year with a teenage main character a wonderful unique magical book called flight flight however was published as an adult book whats going on here
7909 even the most timorous teenage girl couldnt conceive of bella as intimidating its hard to imagine a person more insecure or a situation better set up to magnify her insecurities

7914 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
7915 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
7916 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
7917 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
7918 is this the best my opponent can come up with

7925 if we cant tell the voters that their will is being executed on election day then why do we even have a democracy

7927 if youre not comfortable in giving your social security number dont do that
7928 today the challenges are very different from 1908 when just one in four survived to collect the first state pension in contrast one in four babies born today will go on to live to 100
7929 the impact of this is stark current trends suggest the uk will have its first 120 year old in the early 2060s if not before that means she is already drawing her state pension and will do so for half her lifetime
7930 the state pension is an essential part of modern life in britain our plan is to restore the earnings link and improve the level of payments to our pensioners
7931 from october we will be making it simpler and more automatic to claim pension credit housing benefit and council tax benefit in one call
7932 we have amended the current pensions bill to allow secure data sharing with energy suppliers to help reduce the bills of older people receiving pension credit and in winter 2008 09 there will be an extra 50 on top of the winter fuel payment for households with someone over 60 and an extra 100 for over 80s households
7933 our research into insolvency in english football clubs is revealing not so much a beautiful game as an ugly business
7934 in spite of the football associations efforts to deter clubs from following the path of going into administration it remains an all too common choice
7935 in the recent case of luton town a total of 30 points has been deducted 20 of them as a result of becoming insolvent this punishes the club for the misdemeanours of the previous owners
7936 more significantly though it also greatly reduces the chances of the club recovering which is supposed to be a primary objective of seeking the protection of administration in the first place
7937 hm revenue and customs losing their preferential creditor status combined with the football leagues insistence that football creditors other clubs owed money for transfer fess for example remain preferential creditors is proving increasingly problematic in establishing cvas which the league themselves want as a first step out of insolvency
7938 any other industry sector riddled with cvas would have been heavily regulated into line if english football doesnt put itself into order there is a danger that it will be forced to on terms not of its making or preference
7939 we will be continuing to monitor the practice of administration around football clubs in this country
7940 hopefully from the data we gather we will be in a better position to identify what gets clubs into trouble in the first place and what then is going to get them out of trouble
7941 as such our team believes that we can make a strong contribution in helping to establish a more constructive approach to the issue of football club administration in the future
7942 the prices were very good in the fall and american farmers thought that 6 or 7 a bushel was a good price so they took it
7943 i say what are you doing in the garden my love
7944 oh im just reclining amongst all this delightful vegetation enjoying a beautiful summers day would you be so kind as to bring me a snifter of brandy pip pip tally ho and all that rot
7945 you mentioned that i might experience side effects from the anti depressant
7946 well my tongue mostly also my lip and my nose a little bit
7947 well that may have been it but just in case well keep you below therapeutic levels for another week

7950 we have to make a determination based on what we can control as to what we can fix and what amount of resources we have
7951 but anything else probably will take a bond call with support of the general public
7952 maybe possibly cutting a bus run and paying someone like a parent mileage to be able to bring kids to a certain spot which could save money but thats only an option were looking at it thats not something weve planned to do yet
7953 the pollution from driving a lamborghini is bad enough but flying one thousands of miles for a service is taking climate wrecking behaviour to new heights
7954 with rising fuel costs and mounting concern about climate change most people are trying to save energy they are likely to find this type of wasteful and damaging activity outrageous
7955 if an owner wants to service his car in that way it is his choice im not surprised thankfully the age of excess in some areas continues
7956 prince william is to undertake a final series of military secondments in the autumn said a statement from clarence house his father prince charles official london residence which handles his affairs

7962 only in the weird world of washington are mistakes rewarded with major new responsibilities after mismanging both housing loans and the dot com mess the fed may now become responsible for supervising investment banks history shows that the fed is a poor supervisor and regulator during the 1980s latin american debt crisis the fed worked with the international monetary fund to hide losses of banks this mistaken policy continued until management at citicorp chose to writeoff its losses other banks followed later the treasury negotiated a reduction in the debt and an end to the crisis so what can taxpayers expect from an increase in the feds discretionary authority over investment banks the likely answer is rescues delays and lax supervision followed by taxpayer financed bailouts through its post war history the fed has responded to the interests of large banks and congress not the public
7963 financial companies are calling for greater coordination among central banks stronger industry risk management practices and beefed up market monitoring as ways to restore confidence in the stuggling markets and prevent future crises
7964 our regulators have been lax in their enforcement of existing capital rules says daniel alpert managing director at westwood capital potential losses in this crisis are far larger than in the s amp l crisis with estimates of 1 trillion or more being bandied about if regulators wait too long to clean up the mess the u s starts to resemble japan in the 1990s allowing zombie banks to shuffle along unable to raise capital or lend while the economy lingers in purgatory any taxpayer solution will only worsen already troubling fiscal problems but thats the price for a system that as new york university economist nouriel roubini and others put it privatizes profits and socializes losses
7965 the events of the past few weeks leave u s policy makers at a crossroads in a long running debate about how to police financial markets what we have here is obviously very dynamic markets that have the ability to run circles around regulators and they have an incentive to exploit every possible opening there is for regulatory arbitrage says raghuram rajan a university of chicago economist who sounded alarms about he excesses building up in the financial system back in 2005 one of the most important and least talked about needs for overhaul is making sure that bankers have the right incentives for example in their own compensation to ensure they dont push their institutions to extremes
7966 glib disingenuous contorted and irresponsible and that was the subtle part he turned up on cnbc to say in essence that we had made it all up because we didnt want poor people to own houses while freddie issued its own denunciation the companies also mobilized their wall street allies who benefitted both from promoting their shares and from selling their mortgage backed securites or mbs the latter is a beautiful racket thanks to the previously implicit and now explicit government guarantee that the companies are too big to fail i also received several interventions from friends and even dow jones colleagues on behalf of the companies but i was especially startled one day to find in my mail a personal letter from george gould an acquaintance about whom id written a favorable column when he was treasury undersecretary for finance in 1988
7967 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
7968 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
7969 this rooms gonna be my grave and theres no one who can save me
7970 how long can i live this way is there no one i can pay to let me go cause im half sick of shadows i wanna see the sky everyone else can watch as the sun goes down so why cant i and its raining and the stars are falling from the sky and the wind and the wind i know its cold ive been waiting for the day i will surely die and its here and its here for ive been told that ill die before im old and the wind i know its cold
7971 this mans gonna be my death cause hes all i ever wanted in my life and i know he doesnt know my name and that all the girls are all the same to him but still ive got to get out of this place cause i dont think i can face another night where im half sick of shadows and i cant see the sky everyone else can watch as the tide comes in so why cant i but theres willow trees and little breezes waves and walls and flowers and theres moonlight every single night so ill meet my death but with my last breath ill sing to him i love and hell see my face in another place
7972 so the story fits but then i could have guessed it all along cause now some drama queen is gonna write a song for me
7973 es ist wichtig dass die amerikaner unsere position verstehen und ich denke dass sie sie nun nach diesem besuch sehr viel besser verstehen

7985 weve spent a whole bunch of money on yet another new school building and youre going to have to finish paying for it
7986 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7987 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7988 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7989 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7990 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7991 he can be pretty horrible to work for in a really good sense the training was amazing it doesnt matter whether hes on the phone any time he sees you doing something wrong hell nail you for it and it doesnt matter whether you are the head chef or whatever
7992 hes always on he always sees the problems and he always holds you accountable
7993 when you train who you train with has a big influence from the way you plate all the way up but when you are older and more mature you find what makes you passionate
7994 whats important are the flavours it doesnt matter where a person is from if you use the best products good food is good food regardless
7995 firm but very gracious a classy guy who promotes his chefs
7996 this is unheard of there have even been reports of penguins washing up as far as aracaju
7997 were telling people if the penguins dont appear to be injured or sick to leave them alone so they can swim back
7998 the last time that you got a lot of penguins was in 2000 mostly in rio but some further north that year the sea surface temperature was a degree lower than the 30 year average so the penguins just keep swimming in search of food without noticing where theyre going
7999 dont get pregnant it hurts really badly your boyfriend will leave you dont listen to him youll become fat and ugly amp it takes a lot to get the baby weight off but i dont regret having this child its a miracle and i am so happy to have them albeit it wasnt my number one choice and i would rather have waited but its okay
8000 i wish i couldve waited i really regret getting pregnant
8001 this book of the law shall not depart from your mouth but you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it for then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have success
8002 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
8003 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
8004 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
8005 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
8006 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
8007 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
8008 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
8009 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
8010 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
8011 the only penguin breed on our shores are little blue or fairy penguins
8012 hes definitely not a fairy penguin hes about five times bigger and has yellow bob hawke style eyebrows
8013 he mustve gotten himself lost and just followed the ferry to shore
8014 what if hes already gone by the time i get there
8015 sometimes theyll do 10 so ill do 8 its pretty competitive i guess
8016 are you going to be out here doing this the whole time
8017 so were teaching health and good eating but were also teaching an economic way of being prosperous that is based upon growing food and being in the green environment
8018 if you go down our street you will find that the choices are convenience stores full of junk food and fast foods that are unhealthy yes i am opposed to that
8019 i think the jobs the tax base the elimination of the blighted element putting a million plus dollars into that location is equally as valuable as healthy eating is
8020 to me that would be a family restaurant it could be one of the green jobs coming in yes i want commerce on north avenue
8021 all taxes are kept under review by the chancellor darling as part of the budget process
8022 i have spent 10k here because so and so told me this is what i needed to do
8023 ive pumped 50k into seminars that this guy spoke at and i havent gotten anywhere
8024 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8025 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8026 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8027 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8028 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8029 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8030 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8031 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8032 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8033 looking back over my career i think i had handcuffs on knowing that if you dont make the cut you dont get paid
8034 youre out there and youre in 12th place with five holes to go
8035 when my confidence wasnt there i started thinking maybe i needed to swing a little different
8036 i looked at it and went oh thats what ive done my whole career thats what most guys have done
8037 he knows what im trying to do and when i dont do it he knows
8038 and thats what hes great at and hes great with the mental part too because he keeps me in the present tense
8039 these are the guys ive played against when i played my best golf and i can do it again
8040 ive got a long ways to go but i feel like i belong its nice to have another opportunity at a career we all have our high points in our careers in our lives and i kind of get to re do that again
8041 everybody is really happy to see one of their fellow players do well i think the other tours maybe are like that but not like out here
8042 when you are playing with these kids you have to hit the ball far
8043 i hit it a pretty decent distance but it was hard its really hard to play on those 7 500 yard courses but i think it really helped it was bad on my confidence though but it did help me to learn how to fail a little better
8044 you are constantly failing at this game i was able to miss cuts and keep my head up
8045 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
8046 the field is still the same as it was in the past theres just one guy missing so really it should be just as exciting and good golf as theres been in the past
8047 i hit the ball about as solid as ive hit it in a really long time
8048 the course played really long the first 11 holes was much longer probably the longest ive seen this course play
8049 well this course is still tough i mean whats great about it is you have to hit good shots you have to drive the ball well and it really tests all of your game which is perfect leading into a major

8051 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8052 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8053 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8054 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8055 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8056 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8057 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8058 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8059 despite these challenges our total revenues from credit products rose 5 percent year over year
8060 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
8061 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
8062 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
8063 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
8064 the guy thats won here every year is not here and all the losers are still here
8065 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8066 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8067 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8068 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8069 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8070 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8071 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8072 who are open to doing something on the production side
8073 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8074 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8075 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8076 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
8077 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
8078 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
8079 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
8080 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
8081 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

8084 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
8085 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
8086 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
8087 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
8088 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8089 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8090 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8091 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
8092 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
8093 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
8094 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
8095 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
8096 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
8097 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
8098 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
8099 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
8100 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
8101 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
8102 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
8103 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
8104 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
8105 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
8106 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
8107 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
8108 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
8109 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
8110 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
8111 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
8112 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
8113 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
8114 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
8115 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
8116 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
8117 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
8118 the ultimate disposition that the court reaches today that ms miers is not absolutely immune from congressional process and that mr bolten must produce more detailed documentation concerning privilege claims still does not address the merits of any particular assertion of presidential privilege
8119 hence this courts intervention is strikingly minimal and it is the courts sincere desire that it stays that way
8120 the court strongly encourages the parties to reach a negotiated solution to this dispute
8121 today the district court gave the administration a refresher course in constitutional law namely that there are three co equal branches of government
8122 this ruling is an important validation of the american system of checks and balances

8142 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
8143 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

8146 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
8147 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
8148 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
8149 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
8150 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
8151 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
8152 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
8153 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
8154 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
8155 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
8156 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
8157 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
8158 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
8159 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

8181 need to understand how political processes had in fact operated in order to gauge the necessity for remedial legislation
8182 unique ability to address improper partisan influence in the prosecutorial process n o other institution will fill the vacuum if congress is unable to investigate and respond to this evil
8183 his close advisers cannot hold the superior card of absolute immunity presidential autonomy such as it is cannot mean that the executives actions are totally insulated from scrutiny by congress that would eviscerate congresss historical oversight function
8184 i have long pointed out that this administrations claims of executive privilege and immunity which white house officials have used to justify refusing to even show up when served with congressional subpoenas are wrong

8251 i dont know where he came from but he was there after a very short time
8252 everything seemed like it was slow i dont remember any crash or loud noises all of a sudden we were going over like this and then we stopped
8253 i walked on the roof of the overturned bus to the wheel well area then i realized how bad it was
8254 the bus was lying on its side a pickup was underneath he said
8255 woman in the van it was the first of three objections against witnesses calling franco the driver
8256 i didnt get close enough to see the person in the van but believed it was a female because of the voice
8257 i started looking across the road and there was a van facing toward cottonwood
8258 there was a woman in the drivers seat in the van and her eyes and my eyes met
8259 there was no problem from the waist up but from the waist down her right foot was pinned in the wreckage
8260 i went to the van there was a lady sitting there we couldnt get her out
8261 her foot was stuck the steering wheel was up against her knee and thigh you could see that her leg was just broke bad it was bleeding she was in a lot of pain
8262 its the accident its very hard to accept that my grandsons are dead
8263 but im very satisfied with the way things are going so far its good they didnt have me as a juror i already have franco guilty

8266 i always jinx us then all three of us had the scariest moment of our lives
8267 he pulled the knife out of his pockets which were like that and he turned and was like give me the fn money we were all really shocked and scared
8268 i thought he was going to stab me because he was really close to me
8269 i looked around and was like i cannot believe this is actually happening i could not ever imagine something like this would happen especially in a group of three
8270 i thought it was safe to send the kids out to go to the grocery store

8285 the farther north you go from the border the less that is understood
8286 theyre just not in conflict some people would say that at this end of the distribution chain theyre more interested in cooperating and making money than in conflict others would say theres plenty to go around so theres no need for conflict
8287 im talking about distribution as well as the collection of profits money laundering and smuggling money back to mexico
8288 the american market represents the biggest consumer in the world and all the cartels are focused on it
8289 we dont know how many have been kidnapped but guesstimates by local law enforcement puts abductions in border towns at four to eight a week
8290 they are snatched in the u s and taken to mexico
8291 the u s will begin to see a little of the same conflict that is happening in mexico
8292 if the cartels already have methods and ways of diversifying into other crimes its normal that they wont stop at the border
8293 in the u s there will be violence but its local decentralized a small dose compared to mexico
8294 the american system is much more effective in combating drug distribution
8295 its a tremendous geopolitical issue that law enforcement by itself cant deal with
8296 youre dealing with extremely violent people with the money and resources to do pretty much what they want

8309 most americans are not paying the slightest bit of attention to this
8310 the only people who are making him seem inevitable are the commentariat
8311 he seemed this confident and self possessed when he was down 30 points to he is a confident and self possessed person
8312 this is a typically superfluous response from barack obama like most celebrities he reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria
8313 i do notice that he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself
8314 my sense is that all of those attacks individually are frankly not particularly potent but taken together they are creating a narrative about obama that is not helpful

8378 i havent stopped reading since i read the first book
8379 its just the chance of a lifetime to go to new york ive never been there before
8380 based on the information and reports ive gotten in the last day im probably leaning away from a mandatory helmet law
8381 you know outside of the fact that they lost four ballgames theyve got to be happy
8382 we talked this morning and really the consensus was just stay the way we are we didnt want to change the formula
8383 i think thats a good reason why i put it off kinda dreading coming down here and dealing with it that probably would be the main reason
8384 i was actually waiting for pay day to get my renewals and it just happened to fall on the last day of the month
8385 ive been hearing about the long lines for the last month so i was ready for it
8386 25 minutes half hour aint bad ive heard horror stories a couple hours and all that stuff so i was kinda dreading that
8387 we had no idea what kind of damage but then we heard some water trickling and it was pretty evident that we had some holes in the roof
8388 the good lord was with us nobody got hurt and it could have been a lot worse
8389 a limb fell on the high line and big balls of fire shot out and we thought for sure the house was on fire a couple of times
8390 it was my contention after reading the results of the investigation that the meeting that occurred on november 8th was a meeting attended by a quorum of the commission
8391 were not accusing anybody of committing heinous crimes were not suggesting even remotely that this is a matter that somebody needs to be charged with a crime or go to jail thats not what this case is about this case is about conducting the publics business publicly in a public forum
8392 i got a phone call from a friend who kind of explained what had happened so i was a little bit pre warned
8393 i mean were going to have to rebuild its just a pile of rubble
8394 it looks like it lifted it right up and laid it right on the house dont it
8395 be in the thousands thats for sure yeah i dont know if ten thousand would cover it or not
8396 its just a mess its going to take a while to rebuild
8397 we have nothing that has high fructose corn syrup we have no hydrogenated oils at all no trans fats
8398 once people find out that we have gluten free sandwiches that we actually have gluten free bread we have flour less brownies they can indulge in those things that otherwise theyd have to make at home
8399 hopefully it means that youre body doesnt have to fight those things that are foreign
8400 americans are so busy and they eat out so much and unfortunately the ingredients in those products theyre getting are not as good as the products theyd probably be selecting themselves in the grocery stores
8401 sioux falls is my home town and i feel like sioux falls is ready for something like this i think people are very much ready for it
8402 its unfortunate that its coming down to this because i thought it was just such a storybook ending to a great career
8403 i think one of the main reasons would be when youre used to competing your whole life for a job competing on the field like he has when you basically say you cant compete for the job i think thats hard to deal with from a players standpoint
8404 they thought some younger guys were better and they ended up going into the following season and those guys didnt finish the season for them they were all hurt and didnt play
8405 and its one of those things where they make the call they live with it and thats how it goes were all big boys and its really no big deal
8406 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government

8411 and leaves the group broadly on track to make our forecast 3 8bn buy back for the full year
8412 dont waste your time on speculating and wait until the announcement
8413 are there any indicators now how the season will go
8414 how will the considerable talent recruited in the last few years congeal into a unified force this season
8415 how do you think oregon state will react to not having an experienced back this season such as steven jackson and yvenson bernard to carry the load
8416 there are so many questions to this team i can see this team going 8 4 or even 4 8 so then i was thinking what are the three biggest keys for the dawgs to be successful in 08 so what i will do is list my top three and please let me know if you agree or disagree d line jake locker special teams
8417 the department believes strongly that it is important to clarify that we are not in discussions with either party to change the respective roles of the department icann or verisign regarding the management of the authoritative root zone file nor do we have any plans to undertake such discussions
8418 consistent with public statements made by the united states government starting in 2000 and reinforced by the 2005 u s principles on the internets domain name and addressing system the department while open to operational efficiency measures that address governments legitimate public policy and sovereignty concerns with respect to the management of their cctld has no plans to transition management of the authoritative root zone file to icann as suggested in the psc documents
8419 weve known this forever and people close to the icann process have known it too on one level the letter is a little bit like stating that the sky is blue but for those who have been looking at the sky through their rose colored glasses which includes a lot of people in europe and asia this letter may look like the u s just dropped a big bomb on the internet
8420 im not going to suggest to you that i can outdo alex salmond on the playground abuse approach to politics i dont think thats how our politics should be
8421 in fact i think that much of the language and approach that the first minister takes to our parliament is actually quite demeaning for that parliament i would bring to it a very serious examination of what the snp are actually doing
8422 what i was doing there was devolving more power to scotland than alex salmond ever has including things like power over rail infrastructure

8460 oil companies are increasingly dependent on these unconventionals as they get squeezed out of countries such as nigeria and russia we fear tar sands are just the entrance ramp to oil shale gas to liquids and other non conventionals which will just press the red button for climate change disaster

8469 the fact that the city of minneapolis would give medals of valor and commendation to this swat team is shocking and outrageous

8483 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
8484 indeed the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
8485 house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said thursday that a federal judges ruling that former white house counsel harriet miers has to appear before a congressional committee could pave the way for congress approving a contempt citation against karl rove later in the day
8486 as public officials we take an oath of office to uphold the constitution seriously and todays landmark ruling by the u s district court is a great victory for the american people the rule of law and balance of power we must restore our nations fundamental system of checks and balances and todays ruling begins to restore that balance
8487 as i told the house of representatives in february when we passed the resolution authorizing this court case congressional oversight is an institutional obligation to ensure against abuse of power
8488 and when there are credible allegations that law enforcement has been politicized the need for congressional oversight is at its greatest
8489 pelosi said the ruling could give congress a new impetus to hold rove in contempt rove refused to respond to a subpoena requiring his appearance at a judiciary hearing earlier this month on allegations of improper white house influence over the justice department

8492 we have to make a determination based on what we can control as to what we can fix and what amount of resources we have
8493 but anything else probably will take a bond call with support of the general public
8494 maybe possibly cutting a bus run and paying someone like a parent mileage to be able to bring kids to a certain spot which could save money but thats only an option were looking at it thats not something weve planned to do yet
8495 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose

8508 yo voy a hablar muy claro edu tiene contrato una temporada m s se le ha subido el contrato a un mill n y medio libre de impuestos eso le supone al betis cerca de 400 millones de pesetas pero edu dice que quiere dos millones limpios que ser an 600 millones de coste para nosotros eso no puede ser y por eso le aconsejo al nuevo grupo que no lo hagan pero ellos lo sabr n es muy buena persona buen jugador pero no podemos pagar eso y no se le traspasa porque va a jugar este a o en el betis bien o mal si se lesiona mala suerte nos han ofrecido un dinero y no lo hemos aceptado lo que no va a ser es que le demos a los futbolistas lo que piden
8509 no s cu l de ellos va a ser presidente si lo ha dicho l no creo que enga e a nadie habr recibido el apoyo del grupo detr s de ellos hay alguien que es una fortaleza muy grande por lo que he visto por la forma de operar y pagar

8514 i am sure that yahoo management will take a verbal beating
8515 i just dont think that the annual meeting is where the debate over yahoo strategy is going to take place
8516 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
8517 it is not going to be a retirees board the benefit of having icahn on the board is the status quo is broken it is going to be under an awful lot pressure to act
8518 para ser mi primera experiencia en el f tbol profesional estoy muy contento
8519 como un m ster todos me han ayudado much simo ha sido fabuloso ya tengo ganas de repetir empezar y dar ca a
8520 siempre intentas innovar o incorporar alguna cosita pero el principio es seguir la l nea del a o pasado incluyendo ahora mucho trabajo de blocar que sientan el bal n
8521 es una circunstancia rara y debemos mejorar sobre todo el portero que est m s retrasado el que mejor lo ve todos tenemos parte de responsabilidad y en lo que a mi respecta trabajo para mejorar esa faceta
8522 porque son dos porteros con much sima experiencia esa inactividad competitiva puede ser beneficiosa para mejorar
8523 algunos est n molestos por lo bien que me va
8524 cre an que iba a ser un presidente de paja
8525 cuatro fichas libres y hasta finales de agosto tenemos tiempo para ocuparlas a d a de hoy la opci n m s cercana es la de guayre que al quedar libre nos interesa mucho tiene una oferta del numancia pero l sabe que aqu se le van a dar todas las facilidades para que vuelva a ser el gran jugador que fue a pesar de su lesi n si fichara ser a todo un orgullo poder volver a tener en nuestras filas a dos jugadores del nivel de jorge y guayre eso le dar a un espaldarazo definitivo a la campa a de abonados
8526 voy camino de cumplir mi cuarto a o como presidente amarillo y en estos ltimos tres nadie habr escuchado problema alguno en el tema econ mico que la afici n est tranquila ya que no voy a permitir ning n tipo de desfase econ mico es m s si el club se endeuda el que lo tendr a que pagar de su propio bolsillo ser a yo
8527 algunos est n jodidos por lo bien que me van todas las cosas y c mo he podido sacar esto adelante se cre an que era un presidente de paja y que iba a durar poco en el cargo pero gracias al gran equipo de trabajo con el que me he rodeado las cosas est n saliendo poco a poco hacia delante
8528 no sufrir tanto como los a os anteriores el primer curso en segunda lo pasamos mal el pasado tuvimos un mal inicio y una segunda parte tranquila por lo que espero que esta campa a con la continuidad del entrenador las cosas salgan mejor

8539 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
8540 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
8541 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
8542 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
8543 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom

8550 the breakdown of these talks is bad news for the worlds businesses workers farmers and most importantly the poor
8551 opening of markets removal of tariffs and withdrawal of state intervention in agriculture has turned developing countries from net food exporters to net food importers and burdened them with huge import bills
8552 this process which leaves the poor dependent on uncertain and volatile global markets for their food supply has wiped out millions of livelihoods and placed nearly half of humanity at the brink of hunger and starvation
8553 basically suggests that the poor countries should remain agricultural forever
8554 in order to receive the agricultural concession the developing countries basically have to abolish their industrial tariffs and other means to promote industrialization
8555 the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival
8556 now that wto expansion has been again rejected at this make or break meeting elected officials and those on the campaign trail in nations around the world including u s presidential candidates will be asked what they intend to do to replace the failed wto model and its version of corporate globalization with something that benefits the majority of people worldwide

8584 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
8585 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
8586 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
8587 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes

8600 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
8601 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it

8603 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable

8605 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life

8607 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
8608 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
8609 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
8610 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
8611 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
8612 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
8613 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
8614 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
8615 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
8616 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
8617 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
8618 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
8619 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
8620 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
8621 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
8622 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island

8624 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election

8630 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
8631 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
8632 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
8633 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did

8637 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
8638 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
8639 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
8640 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
8641 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
8642 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
8643 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
8644 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
8645 he just said we need to do all these things
8646 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward

8654 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
8655 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
8656 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
8657 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
8658 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
8659 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
8660 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
8661 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
8662 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
8663 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
8664 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
8665 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
8666 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
8667 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
8668 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
8669 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
8670 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
8671 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
8672 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
8673 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
8674 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
8675 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
8676 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
8677 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
8678 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
8679 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
8680 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
8681 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
8682 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
8683 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
8684 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
8685 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
8686 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
8687 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
8688 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
8689 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
8690 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
8691 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
8692 if the vice president says its do able i believe
8693 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
8694 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
8695 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
8696 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

8708 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

8710 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

8714 dsea just declared war on me by making an asinine statement and well go from there
8715 i am shocked by the tone of their statement that was not the sense of the meeting i had but it tells me their attitude i answered every question they had to make a statement like that is insulting and asinine
8716 they were receptive to about 90 percent of what i had to say consolidation of school districts and support for charter schools probably were not the answers they were looking for but they are answers most of delaware is looking for
8717 we will also protect and preserve a parents right to choose their childs school that right is under heavy attack from the special interests who thrive in our broken status quo bureaucracy driven education system school choice and charter schools are a necessity for parents and children who have been failed by our current system and must be protected
8718 13 doesnt delaware deserve to have charter schools building requirements paid for by the state as regular schools are paid for
8719 12 doesnt delaware deserve to allow parental choice and equal opportunity in education

8725 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
8726 climate change is the greatest environmental crisis that humanity has ever faced but it is not the only serious challenge confronting us there is a simultaneous source problem known as peak oil arising from the depletion of the fuels we are burning particularly petroleum the solution to both climate change and peak oil is to develop renewable sources of energy to use less energy to use energy differently and to make this shift as rapidly as possible
8727 al gores ambitious goal provides a national focus and call to action now whats needed is a clear sighted plan for achieving it one that recognizes the complex issues of energy depletion the vulnerability of the supply chain and the limits of technology we are taking up gores call and presenting a powerful framework to realize this vision a vision that would revitalize america and make it genuinely sustainable
8728 al gores generational challenge to repower america which places energy at the forefront of the national agenda should be the top issue debated by all candidates this fall
8729 energy touches almost every critical issue facing our country including the economy security and the environment gores courageous and rational plan to move to 100 renewable energy sources in 10 years has my full support our 10 point plan provides the stepping stones to achieve this target
8730 we thank al gore for articulating the most urgent action needed to safeguard americas environmental economic and societal future and that of the entire world our mission is to get society off of fossil fuels fast and we embrace the need to move to 100 renewable energy with this plan
8731 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
8732 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
8733 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
8734 the best use of talents and experience i have gained in my life is to expand the political space in which these members and politicians address the climate crisis

8736 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
8737 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
8738 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
8739 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
8740 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
8741 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
8742 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
8743 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
8744 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
8745 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

8753 china asks the us to abide by the basic norms of international relations stop interfering in the internal affairs of china by means of making use of so called religious and human rights
8754 worried at the fact that china has moved away from its commitments
8755 as far as we can have an influence we demand that promises made are kept
8756 the cynicism of the chinese authorities who have yet again lied and the iocs inability to prevent this situation because of its refusal to speak out for several years

8761 however there are far more than just two of these failed charter school businesses across the state the ohio department of education rated more than 57 percent of charter schools as failing in its last round of state report cards a failed rating is one of attorney general danns measures for closure

8772 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
8773 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
8774 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
8775 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
8776 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
8777 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
8778 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
8779 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
8780 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
8781 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
8782 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
8783 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
8784 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
8785 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
8786 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
8787 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
8788 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
8789 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
8790 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
8791 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
8792 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
8793 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
8794 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
8795 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
8796 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
8797 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
8798 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
8799 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
8800 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
8801 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
8802 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
8803 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
8804 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
8805 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
8806 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
8807 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
8808 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
8809 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
8810 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
8811 our dangerous overreliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
8812 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
8813 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
8814 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
8815 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
8816 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
8817 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
8818 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
8819 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
8820 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
8821 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
8822 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
8823 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
8824 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
8825 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
8826 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
8827 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
8828 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
8829 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
8830 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege
8831 a place of relative quiet for contemplation for the families and the wider public
8832 it represents the enormity of our loss both on a personal and public level
8833 ms taylor is fine the rumours which began in england about her health are dramatic overstated and untrue her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly
8834 at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
8835 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women
8836 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
8837 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
8838 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
8839 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
8840 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
8841 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers
8842 more difficult and error prone and invite a surge of litigation
8843 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
8844 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
8845 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
8846 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
8847 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
8848 essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening
8849 i believe that this is the appropriate outcome to a horrific case
8850 likely confined for life in a state mental health facility
8851 i think that theyre happy that hes going to get help rather than prison
8852 and we hope that alameda county treats him fairly as well
8853 you can never truly give or take away money you always get what you deserve
8854 oh my god u were sooooo wasted last night at the show i cant believe u gave that creepy guy your number
8855 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
8856 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
8857 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
8858 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone
8859 we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
8860 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
8861 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
8862 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
8863 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
8864 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
8865 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
8866 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
8867 former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
8868 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
8869 the vice presidents main effort is to mobilize the american people behind meaningful action and less talk about global warming
8870 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
8871 none of us can walk away from this issue without agreeing with him that we do have a very serious problem and its only going to get worse unless we do something about it i hope to be a part of that and i would like to see the free market take the lead not the government
8872 it pointed out that the only way we have a chance to drive down oil prices is if we become free of the slavery of oil if we can give americans choices of electrical cars or biodiesel cars then and only then do we have a chance of dealing with this cost issue that is why 4 a gallon gas is not an enemy of action its an ally of action
8873 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
8874 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
8875 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
8876 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
8877 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
8878 as a city we keep our fingers crossed that the state doesnt come and raid our funds
8879 we have proposition 1a that the voters approved by a very heavy margin where they actually told the state to stay away from the city revenues and the county revenues so were hoping that the legislature doesnt get tempted to borrow from us
8880 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
8881 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
8882 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
8883 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
8884 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
8885 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
8886 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
8887 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
8888 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
8889 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority

8900 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
8901 while it likely the level of non performing loans will continue to increase in 2008 09 it is anticipated the impairment loss expense will remain within the historical range compared to the major bank peer group
8902 unfortunately users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites so the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high at the beginning of 2008 that wed see an increase in cybercriminals exploiting myspace facebook and similar sites and were now seeing evidence of this im sure that this is simply the first step and that virus writers will continue to target these resources with increased intensity
8903 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel

8905 this camera takes really sharp high levels of persistence so that if you get a really of your grandkids you can get it blown up really large and it ll still be sharp
8906 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
8907 a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires
8908 you think the government is wasting a few billion a year on mass transit subsidies
8909 our results show that at least for urinary tract infections cranberry juice targets the right bacteria those that cause disease but has no effect on non pathogenic organisms suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut
8910 we have also shown that this effect occurs at concentrations of cranberry juice that are comparable to levels we would expect to find in the urinary tract
8911 this suggests that to realize the antibacterial benefits of cranberry one must consume cranberry juice regularly perhaps daily
8912 all i wanna do is be with you and watch the day go by
8913 allegations of such abuse should be thoroughly investigated by school districts and if the allegations are substantiated the media may request records containing the identity of the perpetrating teacher
8914 but the most unfortunate consequence and one that is completely unacceptable is that if predatory teachers are undetected children will continue to suffer at their hands
8915 la baja en las remesas es menor si se considera que la construcci n residencial en estados unidos donde se ocupa un n mero importante de mexicanos ha sido de 50 por ciento

8917 mayor incertidumbre en los mercados financieros internacionales podr a dar lugar a condiciones crediticias m s astringentes para el acceso de las econom as emergentes a los mercados internacionales de capital entre ellas m xico

8927 we are the only force for change in the world
8928 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8929 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8930 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8931 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8932 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8933 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8934 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8935 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8936 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8937 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8938 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8939 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8940 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8941 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8942 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8943 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8944 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8945 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8946 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8947 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
8948 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
8949 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
8950 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
8951 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
8952 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8953 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8954 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8955 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8956 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8957 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8958 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8959 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8960 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8961 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8962 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8963 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8964 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8965 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8966 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8967 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8968 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8969 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
8970 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
8971 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
8972 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
8973 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8974 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8975 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8976 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8977 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8978 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8979 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8980 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
8981 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
8982 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8983 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

9017 the guy at the country club with the beautiful date holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by
9018 there are signs that the obama campaigns arrogance has begun to anger reporters
9019 when rove speaks the political class pays attention usually with good reason
9020 obama needs to be careful not to appear too arrogant
9021 closing the circle milbank came to the wapo in 1999 from tnr
9022 eight years ago i was a hard core liberal mccainiac
9023 i still feel some pangs of affinity for the old codger
9024 mccain could redefine the democratic party once again as the champion of wilsonian interventionism
9025 only a handful of politicians per generation capture the publics imagination and channel it toward moral and rational ends
9026 mccains truth telling and his war against soft money made him a hero to the liberal press
9027 what the president prime minister senator etc meant to say before his unfortunate misstatement was
9028 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military

9030 spanish is the official language of ecuador spanish kichwa and shuar are official languages for inter cultural relationships other ancestral languages are for official use for indigenous peoples in the areas they inhabit and on the terms that the law stipulates the state will respect and will stimulate their conservation and use
9031 we are seeing a similar pattern in all of these stocks in which investors are buying at the money and just out of the money calls in a speculative fashion with the expectations that the entire sector is about to turn very bullish
9032 la inclusi n carcelaria tiene que ver con la exclusi n social
9033 from the very beginning when we started this we reached out to soldiers angels which was incredibly responsive because our mission so clearly meshed with their mission to do anything to support the troops
9034 theyve been helping make introductions to people and helping to spread the word within their organization
9035 this news is alarming because the members of our coalition have seen first hand the devastation that an abortion clinic brings to a city
9036 that at no time did they represent themselves as anything but investment people
9037 i dont know if somebody did this as a joke but as far as i know we have no plans of opening a place there
9038 theyve lost a friend theyve lost a teammate theyve lost a brother and thats not easy
9039 i think for the most part they understand the direction were going in some probably even support the direction were going in but its tough
9040 you take a player who has performed the way jason bay has performed off the team and you bring in three young players while 1 2 3 4 5 years from now it should be self explanatory right now its a shock
9041 its tough for these guys and tough to adjust to
9042 we felt we had the right deal and moved on
9043 if thats the case ill look forward to that atmosphere
9044 we just sit out here and wait for cars to park its kind of hard in the morning because we have to put up the signs and stuff
9045 i think i was the first guy off the golf course that day at washington
9046 i guess they wanted to get some negative tests in before anything happens i guess they figured im one of the least likely to be on something you have to go to the gym to be on steroids
9047 why why bother you want me to go even more crazy
9048 i hit the ball about as solid as ive hit it in a really long time
9049 if i hit the next couple of weeks like i hit it today thats not going to be a problem
9050 they want skill to play a factor in every single shot and if you have rough like you have out here today it takes a lot of skill to maneuver a ball on the green when youve got trees in front of you but you can do it if you hit a really good shot i think the players really like what they see here
9051 i took out two canadians maybe the people will start to hate me now
9052 in those two matches the crowd was obviously against me
9053 playing a canadian in front of a home crowd its not too easy to be in this kind of atmosphere im pleased how i handled the whole situation
9054 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
9055 he obama didnt look like those other presidents on our currency
9056 i embody the change that everyone has been waiting for
9057 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
9058 ordinary voters are tired of these swift boating attempts to bring out the negative side
9059 plouffe did not directly address the mccain campaigns charge that obama had
9060 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
9061 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
9062 theres so many things that would be interesting to see
9063 one of my favorite scenes of the whole series is in the tent in eclipse the fire and ice chapter oh do i want to see that theres a lot of things visually that are so much cooler than you can do in a book
9064 would you like to do some sort of podcast it would be cool
9065 what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new hes he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency he you know hes got a hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
9066 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
9067 race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointed that hes used it
9068 we assume this is what the campaign will be like
9069 run negative ads on me continuously and i might point out for the record that his was the first
9070 i had to overcome feelings of guilt fear and shame before i became a leader in the hiv positive community
9071 a feeling of survival led us to hold demonstrations and fight for our rights
9072 in paraguay we have a law that allows discriminatory practices
9073 we want to modify it so that people living with hiv dont lose their jobs and are not barred from schools because of the disease
9074 there are two cases that have not yet been resolved if the accused are found guilty they could be sentenced to two years in prison
9075 international pressure is necessary to change the laws and that is not happening
9076 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
9077 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
9078 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
9079 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
9080 ele usa todo o tipo de droga e pode ser traficante tamb m pois n o trabalha e a casa era freq entada por pessoas que est o nesse meio das drogas ele falou sobre o crime com frieza

9090 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point

9092 goldcorp president and chief executive officer said in an interview
9093 this is the area we plan to be in for decades
9094 we expect that the ore that is produced in this area should go through our mill
9095 goldcorp wanted to act aggressively here they did not log their interest with gold eagle saying they wanted to do a deal until after the agnico placement
9096 it is a premier asset in a premier camp with strategic value to goldcorp and we view this bid as inadequate
9097 it didnt make sense for them to start developing a shaft in an area that we thought was the wrong place
9098 weve been looking at ways to get ourselves well positioned into promising parts of that belt that was the only reason for that gold eagle investment
9099 weve always been nibbling around the edges of the red lake camp
9100 a business plan helps you keep your finger on the pulse of your progress
9101 it allows you to anticipate change then you can be as flexible as quickly as you can
9102 but not necessarily a customer for that idea its a safer bet if youve found your customer or have an idea who that customer is
9103 its better to start with more rather than less if you have to raise money after starting the business you cant focus on the business
9104 its a lot more expensive to fix things after the fact
9105 get a get good lawyer somebody who doesnt dabble in new company creation get somebody who really does it

9107 the one reader or the many can come from our two sources of traffic
9108 subscribers and searchers the subscribers receive the blog posts via rss feed or e mail our top source of traffic is from visitors directly using the url the second source of traffic is
9109 lets figure out how google analyzes and lists blogs and then trick em
9110 mr devils advocate i have a business relationship with google
9111 i am both a customer and a provider i envision google as a gourmet restaurant i feast on the search results it serves but i dont feel i have a right to know or a need to know the recipe of algorithms it uses to dress my google salad
9112 theyre both good as a blog writer im a provider of ingredients that help produce the quality of googles salads soups main dishes its product to googles gourmet restaurant im like a lettuce vendor since i love my google salad and so does according to a may 2008 report from nielson online 59 of all search engine users my bests interests are literally and figuratively served by offering google the best lettuce leaves i can from my blog garden some days the google chefs may choose my long leafy posts theyre a little tough to swallow often prepared from highly technical press releases but theyre reasonable garnishes some days the chefs may choose a small light post perhaps because its like packaged loose leaves the work is already done what google selects most often from my blog offerings are the posts in which i use personal stories as metaphors to explain high tech ideas or to showcase high tech companies and leaders i think what makes these blog posts main dish fare is that i prepare them from the heart google analytics top content report that most visitors go straight to the home page but after that they visit the stories my assessed strengths and how they relate to web 2 0 eye popping information i gained from using attaainci competitive intelligence software insights i derived about wikis from contemplating my cat some days the google chefs pick all three types of blog posts some days they pick none to the google chefs i defer
9113 what if google went away google gone blasphemy anyway according to july august 2008 issue online writing is all about the story in fact asserts writers who are willing to view themselves as storytellers first and foremost who are eager to incorporate new technology into the writing process have a bright future blog diva has a bright future mr devils advocate
9114 i dont need to trick a search engine to achieve my goals my from the heart lettuce leaf blog garden story posts produce organic results
9115 if i could turn your metaphor making to the dark side yep youve convinced me i need to entice you away from vt knowledgeworks to write a business blog for soul irritation enterprises inc im the ceo you know
9116 as far as titles the most important thing to remember is depending on what you are doing you will wear a different hat and have a different title
9117 write me a big bad biz blog everyone has a souls desire whats yours ill give it to you if you write my blog
9118 and he or she will be a patron of literary blog art
9119 that idealism of yours is a one woman conflagration but seriously im the devils advocate not the big guy himself i have limited not infinite cash and im into the greater bad not the greater good youve convinced me i need a blog but not that i need to
9120 i think this is the savvy leader part ive saved the best for last my final bulleted list of value propositions for the title sponsor of for search engines blog posts are each days hot new product with a title sponsorship you no longer have to hope youre mentioned in a newspaper or magazine you put yourself in the news blog entries are archived and provide a perpetual database of informational terms and keywords related to your enterprise when a searcher types in those terms up comes the information they seek paired with your text and logo links what would this mean for you if you were the title sponsor for most search terms google seems to post the most recent blog entry higher in the search results than it does previous posts you could sponsor one blog entry instead of the whole blog which would be of value to produce search results but that single entry would probably fall to later pages of results pretty quickly it can still be found but its less likely to have early page results sponsoring more entries increases your likelihood of achieving more search results
9121 since blogs have no history i can only extrapolate a value proposition from the recent past and from the present
9122 i think i see where youre going with all this its not my cup of hot toddy but i might know a guy or gal ill ask around may i give you one piece of advice blog diva if i promise not to rain on your blog parade
9123 thank you would you be open to hearing just a tiny suggestion
9124 you blog diva are in a dying biz hmm i like that dying part anyway that business to business b2b blogging in 2007 plummeted a nice word dont you think compared with 2006
9125 well find out when we read the comments on the blog
9126 its called an on demand virtual focus group according to
9127 ah but we get comments only if someone visits your blog and leaves a comment let me probe that sore spot with my trident according to
9128 thats not web site traffic thats ashes thats dust thats nanoparticles you and your blog are nobody blog diva
9129 thats who all i need is one single reader to see the post on portaquas water purification treatment plant is an ipo waiting to happen because its got the big hit big three 1 high tech 2 timeliness and 3 social responsibility that one single reader thinks ive got to grab this opportunity before its gone whos the contact let me follow the link in this blog entry to the companys web site ill click on there rafael gonzalez im calling him right now that single reader may or may not be someone who can invest but he or she knows someone who can deal done blog diva ecstatic
9130 it increases the odds of finding blog divas chosen one
9131 this tea is diabolically hot i like it but you still have to show me the money if you want me to be the title sponsor of your blog i need your value proposition im still tempted to rain on your parade in ill leave comments on each of them about how pathetically rinkydink your little blog parade is
9132 positive press for a company is beyond price negative press can cost a company everything an ability to respond to negative press via a blog might save the day
9133 let me poke some holes in your cute save the day value proposition with my cute sharp trident according to your very same source technorati and that was in 2007 you want me to sponsor a blog thats one of millions you do seem like one of a kind blog diva but thats way too many kinds how can you compete
9134 before i answer i want to tell you something youre not wrong youre not wrong to question the value of a blog in achieving strategic business goals business blogs are new we might be able to get the illusion of answers from emarketers may 2008 report the blogosphere a mass movement from grass roots it may well be worth its 695 price tag but its guessing and im guessing were extrapolating about the future based on a bit of the past and a lot of the present
9135 instead of a value guarantee essentially impossible to get in business without a contract im offering you a value proposition
9136 im banking my time my treasure my heart and yes my soul which you may not buy nor rent that business blogs are and will be of value beyond price to the high tech companies showcased and paraded online in front of their target markets
9137 revel is mourning the loss of several of its team members
9138 the design team was heading to minnesota for a glass manufacturing meeting
9139 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women
9140 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
9141 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
9142 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
9143 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
9144 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
9145 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers
9146 more difficult and error prone and invite a surge of litigation
9147 you know she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of the sudden she has all of these children
9148 state workers shouldnt be put in the middle of a political battle
9149 lets put him on the federal minimum wage and get rid of the special interests paying for his hotel room across the street from the capitol and see how he likes it
9150 while i appreciate the governors leadership on this budget crisis i cannot support reducing the salaries of our state employees to minimum wage if our state workers had the power to pass a budget then it might be appropriate to hold them accountable but thats not where the responsibility lies according to our state constitution i cannot predict when a budget will be passed but i do know this when it does happen it will be because we worked to achieve bipartisan solutions i understand what the governor is trying to accomplish with this action but i must respectfully disagree and urge the governor to reconsider his executive order
9151 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
9152 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
9153 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
9154 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
9155 he has a passion for acting to survive a war that gives you enough determination that anything is possible he believes life will go on forever

9204 if youre at risk of alzheimers because your mother had the disease you need to make sure that you take special care of your health
9205 if you had a baseline brain scan and then a follow up five years later and it showed that your glucose utilization was falling off rapidly and in a pattern consistent with alzheimers disease that would be of concern
9206 its certainly plausible that if one inherits faulty mitochondria that might put you at increased risk for alzheimers
9207 it may be that decreased glucose utilization doesnt necessarily mean youre going to get alzheimers disease but that in conjunction with the wrong type of environment or some other genes that might give you a slight risk would combine to give it to you
9208 but in a lot of people it probably is just another insult another hit in a biological boxing match

9232 yes i know what you mean there always seems to be something else to do and see the world isnt small enough for people like us i think having a curiosity about the world is both a blessing and a curse that curiosity makes you a more worldly person you become more sensitive to and aware of cultural differences it spurs you on to want to learn more about the world people yet this wanderlust stirs this constant restlessness which is not altogether healthy being settled has its bliss too

9277 we are here to continue to govern we have a mandate from the people we have a mandate from parliament in the last throne speech and we intend to proceed
9278 but what we will not allow is a situation where mr
9279 i think what canadians expect is for parliament to get on with governing the country i dont think they believe the purpose of parliament is to hold a bunch of kangaroo courts or investigations into scandals that never occurred or to try to pretend that they can second guess the police in an investigation
9280 these are all ridiculous political games that have nothing to with the concerns of canadians
9281 the purpose of mr dions carbon tax is to raise money for the federal government so that he can spend it
9282 that is the only reason a politician ever puts in a new tax and whenever a politician puts in a new tax he says either its temporary or its revenue neutral this tax will be neither temporary nor revenue neutral

9294 the families that were affected by the tire slashings were really petrified they didnt know why it was happening
9295 when there was a charge laid finding that it was allegedly someone from within it was equally disturbing then it changed to concern for him and his family its just a human story
9296 but say it doesnt were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own that isnt going to go away so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen it has not been as easy as i thought it would be
9297 to lew i think it seems like theyre delaying things
9298 in lews mind i think he thinks theyre not being entirely reasonable im not super worried but im concerned i think its important that we get the issues resolved so that we can move forward
9299 but the problem is we cant give them exactly what they want
9300 there are some people with government portfolios who are supporting us because they are worried about their own security

9314 he could have left our facility in a matter of days of coming here because we had done what could be done
9315 whenever weve had people come to us after automobile accidents the most common thing is someone shows up looking for them
9316 when the mexican consulate finally got ahold of someone who they thought was related they said this is not our relative none of them have been in an accident leave us alone
9317 he is unable to write we dont know if that is part of the injury or if he was never able to write
9318 he is ours we receive anybody and everybody who comes here
9319 what should have taken hours or days has taken months or more
9320 they could have much more rapidly identified that tomatoes were excluded and they could have gotten to the peppers more quickly and saved a lot of people the stress
9321 we believe that the fda erred in not finding the source of this outbreak and we believe that the fda erred in not promptly releasing tomatoes from florida given the fact that the test done on florida tomatoes showed no sign of salmonella
9322 on behalf of tomatoes that want their good name back you should say something stronger

9331 im very disappointed and race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointment that hes used race
9332 its very clear what his comments imply anyone who looks at those and previous comments that he has made i think its very clear that he has im very disappointed and i repeat it wont be part of our campaign
9333 senator obama has continuously attacked me but the point is that were drawing differences between our two campaigns what we stand for and believe in that is clearly what the ad was all about it it was about energy and it was about taxes
9334 hes run negative ads on me continuously and i might point out for the record that he was the first i think it was an ad that points out the differences between our two plans of action that we for america
9335 let me say that there are differences and we are drawing those differences and ive said earlier i admire his campaign but what we are talking about here is substance and not style and what we are talking about is who has an agenda for the future of america
9336 all i can say is that we are proud of that commercial we think americans need to know that i believe that we should base this campaign on what we can do for americans here at home and how we can make america safe and prosperous and that is the theme of our campaign
9337 all mired in stagnation all teetering towards the brink of recession

9339 what i read in the justice department report is monica goodling trying to take credit for something she had nothing to do with it is an absolute and total insult to cliff stricklin as well as to me
9340 i certainly checked in with the department and it is true monica goodling communicated with me and thought cliff would be good but she did not have anything to do with the choice

9343 although it is clear that cannabinoids have potential both for the management of ms symptoms such as pain and spasticity as well as for neuroprotection the society cannot at this time recommend that medical marijuana be made widely available to people with ms for symptom management

9345 anecdotal reports from patients that cannabis reduces the frequency of their ms attacks
9346 the ms societys recommendations are a positive step but they dont go far enough surveys indicate that as many as

9348 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
9349 the personal use of marijuana by responsible adults act of 2008
9350 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement involvement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest and jail responsible alcohol drinkers this should be our policy with marijuana as well
9351 the federal governments misguided prohibition of marijuana is a war on young people
9352 because of this failed public policy we have alienated an entire generation to believe that the police and the federal government are instruments of their oppression rather than their protection
9353 the idea of waging a war on drugs is to protect people and here it seems like were putting people in harms way

9393 and troy this is just me one gay guy and his sorry little bit of shit
9394 i havent walked in your cloddish shoes troy and im not saying its been better or the same or worse for someone like me because i dont know how could i know but how could your wife and kid and three bedroom ranch having ass know either how can you sit there thinking you know what life is like for a poor bastard in some smart pumps

9397 the first time we met his head was always turned away from me
9398 as if he was shy and worried that i would say something about his foot
9399 our doctor said that jhay was almost too old for successful clubfoot surgery
9400 but he promised that even though it would take longer than normal he would still be able to do it it took them five months to finish the whole process as i watched jhays feet slowly going to their proper place i could see a change in his disposition coupled with unreserved smiles assuring his mother that he could make it
9401 and he became so happy he started to cry i told him that the sneakers were motivation to heal quickly and exercise his legs so that soon he could get up and play basketball his eyes began to sparkle with a new light of hope and all he could say was thank you words were too much but he gave me the most heartfelt handshake i have ever received and i will remember it forever
9402 i will never forget this for the rest that i live thank you very much
9403 dont look at me look at who is in charge of me
9404 why am i so attracted to someone who doesnt seem especially attracted to me

9413 the announcement of the match for world tag team championship at backlash edge you and christian invented a match that is now a headliner one of main event proportions at backlash it will be the tag team of edge and christian vs batista and ric flair in a tables ladders and chairs match
9414 but that is not the only reason i am out here
9415 so tonight shelton benjamin and eugene will face paul london and randy orton trish and lita will face stacey keibler and torrie wilson and finally chris jericho and hhh will face rey mysterio and the heartbreak kid shawn michaels good luck to all

9427 it was a very positive performance for his first game he has all it takes to be a good player in this team
9428 bischoff is a new player that is young and promising with talent he has had a long break due to surgeries on his groin injury and we may have to wait two to three months for him to reach full fitness and it is a gamble on his talent

9677 i guess the extent of the use or support of the public service for the ruling party was also a concern and they are concerns australia has raised with the cambodian government
9678 there once was a girl named keesha whose jealousy they couldnt keep on a leash a she envied she stewed she hung with those lewd and when it bit her on the ass she said goddamnit i shouldve listened and i know that last part didnt rhyme

9682 im asking the minority to allow me to join in with them in this resolution to say this matter should be cleared up but theres no need even for mean spirited people in the minority to say that im a discredit to the united states congress

9688 we do not intend to use this ruling to discourage our fans from expressing their imagination creativity and passion for star wars through the costumes and props they make for their personal use
9689 rather we see the courts decision as affirming that those who seek to illegally profit from star wars will be brought to task wherever they may be
9690 all they want to do is drill drill drill we cant drill our way out of this mess
9691 but the main thing i saw was as a defensive unit we got better
9692 i say awful if you look stat wise and what we gave up and how much better we could have been theres tremendous amount of improvement to be made
9693 i was proud of the way after we lost jeff and after we lost clint after we lost our whole secondary after four games we hung together and made some plays in the air force game made some plays in the notre dame game made some plays throughout the year to help us win eight ballgames
9694 the challenging part was i had to use my brain and say would you play an extra season or would you rather two more games watching the guys step in and do an outstanding job i know im going to have to work harder to win my spot back
9695 a lot of the times last year we had to rely on our offense to carry us through late in games
9696 but when you have two or three of them it just really helps you focus in a little bit more
9697 when we were at offseason workouts i was having a couple of problems just because of my repetition
9698 well i feel that im back to where i was with catching the punts

9702 after a long and careful study it was clear it was not the same people giving the sample
9703 according to their latest results they were considered to be real contenders for olympic medals including gold
9704 there are many questions the first is what in fact happened there will be a special inquiry
9705 a less important question but a more pertinent one is why is the issue of last years tests emerging just a week ahead of the games couldnt this question have been discussed with us in may june or march
9706 the time was carefully chosen we practically could do nothing neither file an appeal nor look into the case we are simply put aside and our hands are tied
9707 i see it with bougainvillea and vine growing all over it
9708 you did a good job of reaching a resolution that enables both parties to achieve their missions

9728 with some moving to other threatened areas and others returning to the united states

9730 establishing a deadline is the surest way to undermine the hopeful prospects
9731 were still in a bear market theres no question about that but technicals are pointing to a short term bottom
9732 are these job losses accepted by the market at this point i hate to say it but its probably true
9733 the market has been much more worried about inflation than economic growth but wage growth has remained tame
9734 given the current uptrend in the dollar the currency is positioned to post further gains at the mere sign of improvement or better than expected report
9735 there is no argument that non farm payrolls will drop for the seventh month in a row but that may not stifle the dollars rally
9736 we will see a correction in the dollar but for intents and purposes the greenback has bottomed
9737 the economy is setting up for a very moderate rebound
9738 if we get oil to come down it would act as a tax cut to consumers
9739 there will be a realization that the world isnt coming to an end
9740 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
9741 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
9742 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
9743 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
9744 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
9745 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
9746 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
9747 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
9748 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
9749 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
9750 our show is like columbo its more about how they did it than who did it

9752 in a new report the rand corporation suggests the us replace the term war on terror with counter terrorism
9753 under great consideration i have decided to part ways with
9754 i would also like to mention to kerrang magazine that im not leaving to become a preacher as you once noted many years ago and never corrected
9755 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big white house
9756 i wanted to offer him something that he didnt have a rally song one that really captures that maverick spirit
9757 he was physically tortured for years and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades
9758 the entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us

9763 i completely believe that a game could come out and be more successful than wow im hoping that were working on it right now
9764 i think a lot of other companies have had great opportunities to do what wow has done usually for whatever reason they miss the mark
9765 i actually feel really bad a lot of times when new mmos come out and dont do really well because im not thinking of it from a business perspective i know what its like to be a developer on a team that you believe in on a game that you just love and for some reason you dont get enough time or someone makes a bad decision everybodys making a lot of small choices and when those go wrong your game ends up not successful
9766 not making choices based upon being different but making choices based upon whats good for your game
9767 if there was an mmo out there that had a tone different from wow but was executed as well i actually think there could be a huge audience for that when i get disappointed its because i dont see that level of execution
9768 the same challenge is on us are we going to make the right decisions i dont believe that just because we made wow were guaranteed on the next mmo that we make to have the same success
9769 i really believe youre only as good as your last game i really think you gave to prove it every time
9770 the only thing we get for free is faith that well follow up on any problems anything else we have to earn

9804 37 people didnt have anything to throw at him 37 people couldnt have over powered one guy with a knife

9831 it is simply one of those things that we strongly believe that as the birthplace of confederation that we need to truly celebrate the country lee said
9832 what is missing and this has been an ongoing concern that has been expressed by citizens from one end of charlottetown to the other is that we need a family celebration and it is not something that can take place in the midst of a festival of lights
9833 its a far more friendly place to do that hennessey said noting that its the perfect spot for the fireworks
9834 it would be a family picnic opportunity for people to come and relax and to celebrate canada said lee

9842 we work only to pay for the fuel we are not making money
9843 we ask for more but clients cannot give us more because they have no money
9844 in purely practical terms what it has meant is that no matter what health care problems tara has had theyve been covered by insurance
9845 which is a huge blessing because if youre already worried about a little kids health not having to worry about paying for it really helps
9846 i think theyre very fair they come in and ask a lot of questions and their job appears to be to try to be helpful and to get you as much assistance as they possibly can
9847 she said the really key thing to understand is you dont have to worry
9848 the way the swiss government approaches this is that every person who is a swiss citizen has the right to be able to live decently
9849 for me that was just like such a huge wave of relief to have somebody tell you you dont ever have to worry about how your child is going to be cared for
9850 im looking at how organisations and individuals within them can help integration and exchange between the abled and disabled worlds to find out what can be done so that a differently abled person wont feel rejected in whatever the glbtq scene might be
9851 these days theres nothing in the media thats inclusive about people marginalised by disability in the various gay so called communities
9852 you may have christian groups who are helping them and that can pose a real problem for queer people and acceptance
9853 there is a level of homophobia in the disability sector a lot dont have access to the glibt community because the people who control their lives dont think they need to
9854 people with disabilities are considered to be asexual so anything to do with sexuality is swept under the carpet
9855 i dream about opening a vocational school for disabled children nationwide
9856 uncle tin often encourages us to study hard to have a good job
9857 the barren nature immerses natives in poverty so we had only one way to escape poverty to study hard and do well
9858 i hope more and more people will buy our products and invest in our company so that we can expand production and earn more money to improve the life of the disabled
9859 with regret and unfortunately i have to say that i am the main book seller in afghanistan there will be a crisis of books if something happens to us or if we collapse so it is very important that we have others involved in this too
9860 the initial cost is pricey but you eventually get back what you invest
9861 if someone requires more assistance than we are able to provide we can provide referrals and assist them in obtaining needed services
9862 my father is a big music fan and would buy new albums every couple weeks hed put them on in the house and the words to the songs would get stuck in my head before i knew it i was memorizing lyrics and melodies and would hum them everywhere as time went on the love of music just grew and i realized i had a knack for coming up with my own melodies
9863 once i fell in love with writing songs and making music my mind was made up
9864 with my music i try to cover the whole spectrum and then enter uncharted territory i make fun club songs lighthearted songs that are meant to make you feel good and dance i also will make songs that explore relationships and songs about dealing with personal insecurities and topics that have depth
9865 there also arent a lot of artists that are as hands on with their music as i am i write my songs arrange the vocals sing all my background vocals sit through the mixing process and put together my show sets im hands on through the whole process and im very specific when it comes to how i want things no shortcuts
9866 there will be three new jersey cover bands there illegal motion third sun goodbye amy
9867 there will be upwards of 40 silent auction items ranging anywhere from 10 to 5 000 so there should be something for everyone well have mets tickets great adventure tickets autographed memorabilia
9868 my aunt passed away while i was in training for the first walk i did it in honor of her cancer has touched so many people including my dad who i lost three years ago to cancer i feel like i need to do something
9869 its a phenomenal experience when you see the survivors in their pink shirts
9870 thats the reason why we walk at the end of the walk we do a sneaker salute to the survivors it makes my hair stand on end when i talk about it
9871 people treat each other the way people should always treat each other people are very open with their stories people talk about why theyre walking who theyre walking for last year there was a woman who was eight months pregnant and walking there was also a woman with two prosthetic legs
9872 it legitimized our fundraising efforts and it allowed us to form relationships with businesses in the local area
9873 we planted close to 18 000 bulbs in different parts of south brunswick and princeton
9874 each one is dedicated to a person struck by cancer they will come up every summer for years to come it shows that there is hope for a cure for cancer
9875 there are about 300 or 400 crew members they really make the weekend possible my oldest daughter heather just turned 16 last year so that was her first walk lauren my younger daughter really helps with the whole fundraising thing
9876 through these measures we are ending decades of unfair unbalanced and insufficient provision of affordable housing in new jersey
9877 the fact is this legislation holds much promise for the thousands of new jerseyans who want to stay in their hometown to work there and raise their families there but simply cant afford to live there
9878 i also want to recognize the courage and persistence of our legislative leaders especially assembly speaker joe roberts for being at the forefront of this issue and standing up for people who need affordable housing in new jersey
9879 new jerseys affordable housing laws have failed to live up to the promise of providing homes for low and moderate income residents while having the insidious side effect of concentrating poverty in our inner cities
9880 new jerseyans need homes they can afford and jobs they can reach today we are transforming the states almost barren affordable housing landscape from one of lost opportunities to one of hope and promise for thousands of families
9881 low income new jersey families are burdened by some of the highest rents and housing costs in the nation
9882 we have a moral responsibility to countless new jerseyans disabled residents families living on limited incomes and senior citizens to ensure access to housing is safe and affordable
9883 new jersey cannot continue as a state comprised of towns where a lack of affordable housing blocks police firefighters or teachers from living in the communities they serve
9884 this overhaul of the states affordable housing laws is long overdue
9885 todays movies have great technology but great movies are made from great scripts
9886 the film industry is crying out for movies with great scripts i give my students the benefits of what i learned when i first tried to write and promote my scripts
9887 a script has to have a storyline that has a beginning a middle and an end
9888 good strong character development is needed dialogue flows from the character speaking to you it sounds simple but it isnt and it isnt like writing a book
9889 you can teach screenwriting and have a person become a successful screenwriter
9890 it isnt luck you know how i spell luck w o r k you may have talent and a great idea but you need to work to make that great script
9891 for screenwriting you cant be afraid of being alone when you write
9892 if you feel insecure you will freeze and the words will not flow
9893 they appreciate the hours i save them in the screenwriting process
9894 and at that point security became aggressive and ultimately assaulted the new jersey couple
9895 did illegally and without cause approach and assault and batter bryan siegel while causing injuries siegel was placed in handcuffs causing further injury siegel was falsely arrested and falsely imprisoned in that he was handcuffed and held against his will for a period of time siegel was issued a summons and must now defend himself on criminal charges that are completely without merit
9896 failed to maintain proper crowd control which allowed bryan siegel to be assaulted
9897 it is a travesty that two innocent people attempting to tell the truth to shea stadium security about the victimization of an elderly couple get assaulted by shea stadium security one charged with a criminal act when they did nothing wrong
9898 while billy joel was the last concert at shea the notice of claim filed today is the first step in the legal process to get justice for what happened to this couple unfortunately what they learned in an attempt to come to the aid of an elderly couple is the old adage no good deed goes unpunished this is not the way a great stadium like shea should be remembered
9899 we negotiated and i was allowed to go home on saturday
9900 we did a lot of stuff in the 10 years i was in bucks county

9908 its not me to scream and yell and dance on the pulpit
9909 my sermon is very well thought out all written out word for word i preach from a complete manuscript reflecting the scholarship that i benefit from people deserve a well reasoned and argued sermon
9910 every days different this is also difficult for my personality because i like everything nicely arranged
9911 everything ive worked for all my life wouldve been gone just because of someones negligence
9912 of all my years of being a crossing guard with floods and tornado warning and such this was traumatic this was top of the scale
9913 we dont want to put the children back into the school until we get clearance from the gas company or oem
9914 he represents human nature he looks at someone sent directly from god and questions him
9915 i wouldnt like to be jesus hes way too saint like for me
9916 i like playing the good guys gone bad but i wont lie it is hard this is the only character ive played where i still question how i should do it even if someone had this part for 20 years they wouldnt know how to portray it
9917 it does not have all the lights glitter and glamour of modern broadway its good to go back to the roots with a very simple setup
9918 you have to work with the natural lights youre given and you have to deal with weather bugs all of natures elements
9919 maybe when i was younger and in my prime i liked being on stage more

9926 the politics of fear it shows obama in muslim attire his wife toting an assault rifle a picture of osama bin laden on the wall and a flag burning in the fireplace all in the oval office
9927 just dont get it that their house organ magazine was actually satirizing hopeless red state drones for fearing obama no you cant draw pictures like that they say because people might get the wrong idea the wrong idea is never a problem when a cartoon involves republicans
9928 please in the name of all thats holy will you all just shut up
9929 i know it was the new yorkers attempt at satire
9930 but you know what its a cartoon larry and thats why weve got the first amendment and i think the american people are probably spending a little more time worrying about whats happening with the banking system and the housing market and whats happening in iraq and afghanistan than a cartoon
9931 i knew my horse has early speed so i just went to the front from the gate
9932 gottcha gold didnt go for the early lead so i was able to get my horse to relax up front he turned it on for me when i asked him
9933 i didnt know what i was sitting on until the gates opened
9934 he broke well and relaxed for a bit he really turned it on for me in the lane when i got into him this is a really nice colt

9936 we got alien strike when she was 2 in 1994 and she was a winner right away and went on to win stakes she gave us a lot of thrills especially since it was our first horse i guess we thought it would always be that easy

9938 we put the foal in a kentucky yearling sale in 2006
9939 he didnt make his reserve and we bought him back for 53 000
9940 he went to julia householder in kentucky to be broken and her farm is close to ken mcpeeks place

9957 i was just reading that wild bill hickok he had the first duel in the town square here in springfield
9958 so were going to research that cause im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right now right here i am a quick draw
9959 youve seen the ads they just replace the name each election cycle but its the same ad over and over again
9960 now listen not every lobbyist is bad i mean some of them theyre just trying to present their point of view
9961 my passion for photography began around 1979 when i purchased my first camera
9962 i enjoy outdoor activities so many of my photographs consist of landscapes and aerials
9963 youve been elfed by office max or the south park
9964 have we come closer to a creative solution to this problem
9965 stringing methods together in a particular order might lead you to a
9966 the first question i asked myself was this could a fighter pilot boil down how they functioned into a neat and tidy set of methods i doubt the answer is yes
9967 air combat training is focused on teaching these maneuvers so that they can execute them from instinct
9968 bader attributed his success to the belief in the three basic rules that had been tried and tested by earlier fighter pilots if you had the height you controlled the battle if you came out of the sun the enemy could not see you if you held your fire until you were very close you seldom missed
9969 if an experience is unique to the individual then how can this be best represented in this case model process
9970 the myth of methodology in short form is the belief that a playbook exists for innovation
9971 these cards can be used by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation in this case the card is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear
9972 researchers have been investigating technological innovation for decades but we know almost nothing about how companies manage design innovation
9973 if i make a car that can brake in 10 yards instead of 50 thats a quantifiable advantage that is easy to understand but if i decide to create a computer out of translucent colored plastic its much more subjective people will love it or they wont
9974 design driven innovation is pushed by a firms vision about possible new product meanings and languages that could diffuse in society
9975 apple is a company that is pushed by a vision
9976 steve jobs has said that the market doesnt always know what it wants companies that do radical innovation do not listen to users they eventually value market feedback but first they propose things to the users
9977 companies that do radical innovation do not listen to users
9978 innovators avoid proposing a wide range of product signs and languages as a way to protect brand identity
9979 they tend to adopt strategies that allow customers to easily reconnect specific product signs to their brands
9980 the confusion that this creates in the market is called semiotic pollution
9981 imitators can be successful if they wait four or five years to determine what they should produce but in the beginning its not clear which product is the winner so when it comes to product languages imitation is a very expensive strategy
9982 it seems that the innovators understand and build off each others ideas better than the imitators do
9983 they innovate in a circle its a similar dynamic to what occurs in a visual arts movement like impressionism
9984 in every industry sooner or later there is a radical change in the language of its products
9985 so the point for companies is do they want to lead the change or do they want to suffer the change
9986 many of the italian furniture companies ive studied are as small as 80 employees they dont have the marketing muscle or distribution power of larger entities yet theyre world leaders in the field
9987 if you come to my house you will find a lot of semiotic pollution
9988 having many different styles in one home is actually a trend though people today want to have their own look
9989 i wanted to do something to give back to the people of iraq and you guys because you work so hard for me
9990 the first time i was here i ran the roads so i didnt get to interact a whole lot with the people of iraq
9991 i didnt know what to expect when i came on this tour
9992 the last time i didnt have the opportunity i have now
9993 i thought they would send things over but it grew to a much larger thing
9994 he is very good to us said ninos emanuel esha a crew supervisor and father of a little girl named venessa
9995 this last thing that hes done for us for our kids for our families we are very appreciative for him it increases confidence between us and the americans
9996 i couldnt ask for a better crew or better supervisor the relationship i have with them is just beyond anything i could expect
9997 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004
9998 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
9999 because of these operations extremists who once terrorized the citizens of these communities have been driven from their strongholds
