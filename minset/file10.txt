100001 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
100002 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
100003 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
100004 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
100005 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
100006 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
100007 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
100008 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
100009 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
100010 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
100011 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
100012 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
100013 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
100014 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
100015 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
100016 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
100017 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
100018 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
100019 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
100020 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
100021 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
100022 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
100023 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
100024 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
100025 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
100026 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
100027 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
100028 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
100029 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
100030 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
100031 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
100032 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
100033 i was surprised at how much the parental pressures ended up being in the movie
100034 the parents want them to have this whole future theyve imagined for them that the kids havent imagined for themselves
100035 i think they get into this dynamic with their kid and it doesnt matter that the camera is there
100036 its just the way they communicate they fall into this pattern
100037 its a chance to connect to the second generation of nick viewers
100038 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
100039 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
100040 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
100041 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
100042 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
100043 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
100044 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
100045 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
100046 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
100047 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
100048 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
100049 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
100050 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege

100073 we have already opened up most of our public lands to oil drilling and gas prices have not gone down

100091 tun mahathir still loves umno this is an ultimatum for umno members to show their dismay with the leadership and return the party to its original purpose

100095 it appears that senator brownback has seen both the energy sector and those votes as important to talk to and try to convince them the republican party is the correct one
100096 they have the convention and there are lots of things that happen for the mccain campaign
100097 there is absolutely no doubt that the current conservative party under stephen harper is far more closely tied to the u s republicans than the previous progressive conservative party ever was

100101 he used similar language at two other campaign stops that day
100102 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
100103 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
100104 but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
100105 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
100106 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name
100107 the republicans will be happy to play the race card
100108 the mccain camp watched our side in the democratic primary very carefully
100109 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt that they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics

100124 ahora mismo me los pone de corbata el petr leo es una pu alada trapera
100125 el chaparr n de malas noticias econ micas est poniendo en evidencia al gobierno que se empe en evitar la palabra crisis para no afrontar la cruda situaci n que ha errado en casi todas sus predicciones y que no ha sabido reaccionar ni encontrar verdaderas soluciones
100126 la magnitud de los acontecimientos y la perspectiva del tiempo permiten ver ahora con claridad lo que ya adelantamos en su d a la peque ez de iniciativas como la desgravaci n fiscal de 400 euros las ltimas medidas del ministerio de industria para ahorrar energ a s lo es m s de lo mismo
100127 ayer conocimos que los precios est n ya en el nivel m s alto desde que comenz a elaborarse la serie hist rica del ipc

100135 es el tiempo ya transcurrido el que pone en evidencia la parsimoniosa reacci n del gobierno adem s de la necesidad de que las iniciativas ya impulsadas y las que se vayan a adoptar resulten eficaces no s lo para resistir los embates del acusado decrecimiento sino para sentar las bases que permitan superar las carencias estructurales de nuestro modelo econ mico
100136 aqu y ahora lo que es grave como circunstancia a adida a una crisis que nos dejar canijos y parados es que el sistema fomenta la fuga vacacional de quienes debieran trabajar sin descanso para resolverla

100140 tras el anuncio de fusi n de iberia y british airways el acuerdo por el que gas natural comprar el 45 de uni n fenosa a acs es la prueba de que frente a la crisis y ante la inacci n del gobierno el mercado toma sus decisiones
100141 con este pacto empresarial concluye un periodo de incertidumbre en el tablero energ tico nacional
100142 algunos expertos han interpretado la operaci n como la soluci n espa ola a los retos del sector

100146 en esta ocasi n las cosas se han hecho mejor por la v a del pacto empresarial y sin ruido
100147 hay que celebrar el positivo acuerdo alcanzado ayer por gas natural para comprar uni n fenosa a la constructora acs en primer lugar porque esta operaci n evita que la tercera compa a el ctrica del pa s caiga en manos extranjeras

100180 yorkshire day is an excellent opportunity to reflect on many of the great things there are about living here
100181 yorkshire is a great place where national parks sit side by side with vibrant and exciting cities
100182 if im honest its taken a while but its nice to get past 200 but i should have done it 15 or 20 tests ago
100183 at this time statistics dont mean that much to me maybe when im older ill sit down and look at them
100184 but i want to take a lot more than that for the team and i want to perform better than i have before and i want to keep improving
100185 at this moment in time im not driven by statistics or records i just want to do well
100186 when youre bowling against one of the best players in the world like kallis it brings the best out of me it was up there with one of my better spells
100187 it means a lot to us getting back into the series and doing well for england and i think we showed that having not scored enough runs in the first place to get back into this position weve fought hard
100188 any time you get good battles in test cricket its great for the game
100189 people are saying that with twenty20 around test cricket is going to die but i dont think it is anywhere near dying with exciting afternoons like that what more do you want
100190 he bowled a fantastic spell and brought england back into the game there is a little bit in that wicket still and he hit the right area more often than not and made life tough for our batters
100191 hes bowled very well his lines been excellent and hes got more pace out of the wicket than anybody else
100192 its a bit easier for bowlers going on and off but not that easy for anyone and he did pretty well with that new ball burst
100193 the wicket at the oval will obviously have a lot more bounce than this one if he gets a wicket with bounce in it then im sure hed be a handful
100194 england havent done themselves any favours in selection they have selected themselves into a bit of a hole
100195 the result has been inconsistency even in the new zealand series just from a cricketing point of view i dont think england played particularly well
100196 batters were struggling against a new zealand side which is still growing
100197 the balance of the side is what they are finding quite difficult to get right but harmison should definitely be in the 12
100198 its definitely better i feel much more comfortable up at the net im being a bit more aggressive on the second serve return than i was before and im definitely physically stronger as well
100199 so i feel more comfortable and feel that i can definitely compete at this level for five or six matches rather than two or three like i was able to do last year
100200 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
100201 after taking a few different exams and mris this morning the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
100202 there are so many mixed feelings because last night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
100203 but after the tests this morning for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
100204 but on the other hand this is something that needs a lot of time to heal which really hurts me to say that i have to miss the olympics
100205 im not exactly sure what was said or the context of it so its probably in my best interest to maybe chat with him and figure out exactly what was said how it was meant
100206 i dont want to say something against one of my team mates
100207 i obviously love the ryder cup it is a long week it is a hard week

100226 we were involved we just couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be so it was just one of those things
100227 we could please other clubs its just the fact that weve got to please ourselves a little bit we think we know what the value of those players are not only the players on one side of the fence but on our side of the fence you have to really evaluate that we just thought that maybe it was just a little bit too rich an ask for us
100228 i think at some point we had a good feeling about it
100229 i think its good for the game all of the attention

100231 this garden is therapy peace work but work is good i love to work
100232 the urge and desire to know about plants was like the urge to eat ice cream i think i was born this way
100233 i was smoking pot like cigarettes it was the thing that had me by the throat
100234 perennials have more design and texture to them though not necessarily color unless you have a variety
100235 i like people to see this as a working garden
100236 i give all credit to my personal savior jesus christ
100237 the more im around people the more i love my garden

100244 frontdoor delivers an experience that is richer and more compelling than that found on any other site in the real estate category and were proud to be part of it
100245 we believe online real estate is much more than just home search its about finding a place to live and frontdoor gets that
100246 frontdoor exists to give people deep home related content when and how they want it and the terabitz neighborhood explorer and iphone application fit the bill
100247 our users with iphones can now take the frontdoor experience with them wherever they go and every listing on the site is now placed in a context of comprehensive neighborhood information
100248 this relationship means our content and tools and will reach millions of new users and thats a great thing for terabitz
100249 but the real winners here are the consumers seeking places to live and the real estate agents and brokers who have partnered with frontdoor to make those aspirations a reality

100251 if this guy was found in his apartment with say a bunch of iron maiden albums thered already be congressional hearings
100252 he was a major head case right wing media foments this kind of anger at the world and at liberals it lays bare that the conservative ideology really has nothing to do governing it really has to do with an anger that theres a whole world of

100254 mark maron and i are trying to figure out at the very least an internet show
100255 its hard to know when but the net will be the major distribution platform for audio content it already is but were only five years away from having the internet in the majority of new cars and a only a couple of years from everyone listening on their phones
100256 were eating this same produce in mexico and we havent had any problems
100257 with this funding we will support treatment for at least 3 million people
100258 were not asking to run the investigation but theres an abundance of knowledge in the industry that can help protect public health
100259 remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
100260 were on the threshold of a new era of technology where we might have some definitive strategies to better treat or cure diseases like als or other neurodegenerative diseases
100261 its possible to use these cells to make the actual cell type that is destroyed in that persons disease
100262 it takes the study of disease out of the patient where its very difficult and into the petri dish
100263 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
100264 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
100265 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
100266 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
100267 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
100268 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
100269 its a little bit like a free lunch without the calories
100270 youre getting the benefits of exercise without having to do any work
100271 the mouse doctors and cell biologists are of course quite enthusiastic about these things but the human doctors are a little more reticent
100272 it was found to be a quite safe drug at least at the doses we were using
100273 when i was 19 and just finished drama school in london i bought my frst bike and i had it parked outside my apartment
100274 every time my parents came down to visit i would hide all my bike stuff my helmet my gloves my jacket up in the girl elskas flat upstairs
100275 i love it and i believe traveling on them is very different than traveling in a car
100276 theres a huge amount of fear mongering about africa as a continent
100277 and it just didnt ring true to our experience of being there
100278 we found that when you are with people who really have very very little they are sometimes the most generous people you are ever likely to meet
100279 weve done kind of the northern hemisphere weve done scotland to capetown i suppose the obvious next trip would be from south to north america
100280 we feel that lithium ion is a more advanced and more efficient technology
100281 its obviously not ready for market introduction yet but we intend to pursue that as our hybrid battery technology
100282 weve been working on hybrid development for a while but as we looked at where the global market opportunity is its with a q5 size vehicle not a q7 size vehicle
100283 i like to stay in the background and let my team shine
100284 when they took the patches off my eye i could see the edges of a table and i thought that was just fabulous
100285 if were successful with some of our discussions relative to alliances or partnerships you very well could see some new platforms some new vehicles out next year
100286 for sure weve got a strong lineup coming in 2010 with all of the traditional brands
100287 but more fuel efficiency better performance better fit better finish a lot more consumer oriented responses
100288 light vehicle sales in the u s appear to have continued at particularly depressed levels through the end of july despite very generous incentive programs
100289 leasing always made sense when you could shorten the term get a little bit more product and have a lower monthly payment
100290 going forward that paradigm may or may not be accurate any more
100291 this will give us an opportunity to have companies stay in the state
100292 a significant second quarter loss driven in part by the previously disclosed negative impact of the american axle and local union strikes in north america as well as the continued weakness in the u s auto market and adverse vehicle segment mix
100293 the u s economy is really headed down and with it auto sales consumer credit is absolutely dissolved on the mortgage side and it continues to degrade now in auto
100294 the terms of your ability to sell assets at a fair market
100295 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
100296 every place i went i was listening to the radio to know who was going to be the new coach at michigan state
100297 george had indicated that he was going to hire me
100298 that was really disappointing for me because i was excited about coaching for him and coaching at michigan state
100299 i told george you know id love to coach with you but i cant do that
100300 i dont feel i would have gone to any other team ive been retired six years ive had teams call me
100301 its been a long 18 months but thankfully im feeling great now and in good health
100302 i really believe hes going to chicago for personal reasons
100303 id like to think professionally we offered him everything that he wanted but i know he has his son involved in the chicago blackhawks if you ever get a chance to work with your family thats special
100304 he really allowed us to go from being a talented team in the mid 90s to a championship team
100305 he came in and he drove our players he made some moves as the director of player personnel to bring in slava fetisov who is ever going to forget that
100306 who is ever going to forget him putting together the russian five or scotty really willing steve yzerman to become in my opinion the best two way player in the game and obviously the championships
100307 one of the reasons ive become a manager in the national hockey league was because of the winning we did
100308 the opportunity to work with scotty every day for six years is something ill never forget
100309 if you look on the web site im no 5
100310 i looked at the depth chart i peeked at it one time just to see
100311 i know that thats obvious im the guy in the preseason game who comes in when all the vets got their reps and i try to show out i try to get 100 yards
100312 if he asks me to go out with the 10th team im going to go out there whenever he calls my number i just want to go out there and do the right thing
100313 i was the air it out champion every year at receiver
100314 ive got a little something i wouldnt be surprised if sooner or later in my career im at the slot position
100315 running post routes if reggie bush can do it i can do it im just saying im not scared we have post routes at the running back position were just not that far in the playbook but i can do it i can do it
100316 i even threw a halfback pass for a touchdown in college
100317 none of the funds appropriated by this act may be used to prohibit or discourage the use of the words or phrases jihadist jihad islamo fascism caliphate islamist or islamic terrorist by or within the intelligence community or the federal government
100318 words that work and words that dont a guide for counterterrorism communication
100319 unintentionally portraying terrorists who lack moral and religious legitimacy as brave fighters legitimate soldiers or spokesman sic for ordinary muslims
100320 caution in using terms such as jihadist islamist and holy warrior as grandiose descriptions
100321 the national counterterrorism center and the department of homeland security have issued memos imposing speech codes
100322 these are precisely the terms that osama bin laden and other terrorist leaders use routinely to describe their actions against the united states we should not let them define this debate and claim a false mantle of legitimacy
100323 im fearful that my outings put my season in jeopardy
100324 i just thought it was something i was going to have to deal with as i get older
100325 i got carried away it wasnt intentional i was excited it was a big spot for us
100326 i think hes been a good presence in the bullpen and with him at the back end the ninth inning guys know their roles
100327 youve got the no 9 hitter and youve got grady sizemore on deck and you throw a 3 2 breaking ball that is not acceptable
100328 on a 3 2 count in that situation you know the guy is looking for a fastball i should have gone ahead and thrown it thats the way i normally pitch here it is hit it
100329 the pitch i was more upset about was the pitch when i hit fasano i had two strikes on him it kind of went downhill from there
100330 you cant get too upset at yourself for stuff like that
100331 but the stuff leading up to it is what you get upset about the hit batter and the walk
100332 if grady comes up and does that with nobody on its not that big of a deal
100333 i feel like i let one slip away a little bit
100334 i feel like i had some pretty good stuff my command wasnt as good as i would have liked but i had plenty of situations where if i make some pitches i can get myself out of some jams or not even create the jams i got into
100335 weve done it all year long you cant win doing that you just cant do it
100336 anytime you have that as an addition absolutely it helps your bullpen but it doesnt help anybody else if people are walking people he has no bearing on that whatsoever
100337 think about how i got to the nfl think about how i got to the position im in now i was undrafted man ive been cut three times
100338 do you think theres something that is going to deter me one bit i wouldnt be where i am if i was like that i just keep moving forward
100339 thats why im in the nfl man because i scrap
100340 i wouldnt be here if i didnt scrap if i didnt scrap id be working a job somewhere
100341 now if the coaches decide to do something else as a player i just adjust and play im a player theyre the coaches they make the decisions all i do is come out here and work hard and compete every day
100342 detroit fbi is asked to investigate dps calloway suspicious of how school funding was spent
100343 zeke why do you have to get into everything why cant you just play
100344 page the point of this revision was to add a section full of testaments to my character attitude ambition and goals so it was done and id like to thank all of the close friends who contributed a little tid bit for me to put into that section
100345 i cant wait till youre in philly again man so i
100346 well to be frank since i decided to spend the month of july in
100347 i know theres a niche here and im going after it
100348 any woman who does not want to be fully exposed
100349 theres a niche customer for that and we do have that customer come into our stores frequently so we do cater to her
100350 we have a few styles that we offer in long sleeves for that customer
100351 customers will say im having a religious wedding what can you do to these dresses to fit my standards usually arms covered neckline covered no cleavage very little skin
100352 they still want the look thats hot thats why we offer more options to add a sleeve add a neckline
100353 these brides want to look very sexy but modest too
100354 we need to try and understand where is the sweet spot in the market the trade off between pure electric range and the price premium that the customer is going to have to pay for that vehicle
100355 when they pull a carrot out of the ground and its big now theyll say wow this will bring a lot of money at the market
100356 we really are focused on people building relationships and making food the glue of that relationship
100357 one hundred percent of those profits go back to the growers
100358 why dont we rip up the backyard and plant a meadow
100359 its relatively difficult for these invasives to get established once the meadow is dense and thick
100360 but until then the seeds can be in the ground already and when theyre disturbed they start taking off
100361 we had to cut it off at 200 this year
100362 the savings in water fertilizing and mowing is usually an ancillary thing
100363 occasionally we hear people say i hate yellow or i want pink
100364 a diaspora of different plants and times and places a sort of knit together group of plants to make sure all the bases in the meadow are covered and there isnt any room for weed seeds to germinate
100365 theres never a time you dont have something to do
100366 we get into the minds of the artists go to the place and use the materials
100367 its all about how all this works together its about how we preserve what we see how we use this in terms of painting and then i try and amplify the experience for the audience
100368 he has the rare ability to combine the arts history science and philosophy into his teaching
100369 we wanted to look at the people behind the art we wanted to show how they were trying different things
100370 certainly pbs has had famous painting shows in the past
100371 it combines art criticism and history with art instruction we just found it to be an interesting concept
100372 we believe there is nothing like it on tv we make a big point of not talking down to anyone
100373 no idea is too deep for anyone this is a show that has intellectual content but it is for everyone intellectualism is not an exclusive province
100374 what ive learned it is always better to bring children with you

100384 woolworths understands that there is genuine hardship across the transport industry
100385 woolworths pays appropriate national fuel levies to all its transport providers
100386 it is our expectation and our transport providers responsibility that these fuel levies are passed on to any drivers who are subcontracted by our direct transport providers
100387 as a company that depends on transport woolworths accepts that higher fuel prices are a fact of life
100388 all sectors of the logistics industry must work together to ensure that we can meet the challenges ahead rather than unfairly placing blame on selected participants
100389 we maintain the big transport clients who are the ones contracting the drivers to do their work they are basically holding out on paying these drivers a fair rate of pay
100390 coles and woolies and the big retailers they have the power to do that give relief

100394 ive made an opinion about what i feel is our leagues decision in regards to players going to england but the form of danny buderus and michael crocker warrants their selection in this squad
100395 and if they continue on that form theyll warrant selection in regards to the world cup
100396 in discussions with a couple of selectors prior to the squad being chosen they felt that both michael crocker and danny buderus werent deserting rugby league in australia
100397 they felt theyve given absolutely great service to rugby league here and theyve just got to that stage in their career where theyre going to move so that they can lengthen their career a little
100398 so they felt under those circumstances where theyve given great service and they should be rewarded by being considered for this
100399 its not as if theyre 21 year olds going to another comp theyve been out and out champions for australia and at origin level and they felt under those circumstances they should be considered
100400 mark gasnier completes his rugby league commitments on october 31 when the tournament is not even halfway through and hes not a rugby league player so i think those circumstances would have made it difficult for him to be selected
100401 tim macartney snape deceives schools who invite him to talk to students about climbing mt everest by exploiting the occasion to promote jeremy griffith and his teachings

100403 it is unsurprising that the impact upon his career as a speaker was dramatic and immediate
100404 the national broadcaster conspired with a religious fundamentalist to do a complete hatchet job on a groundbreaking scientific idea
100405 thirteen years later the truth has caught up with the lie

100407 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
100408 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
100409 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
100410 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic

100425 ive lost a daughter and a son in an instant
100426 he came in very soon after the show started im going to guess 10 minutes after the show started
100427 i did not see or hear him do anything i was sitting with my arms around my daughters very much absorbed in the show
100428 suddenly there was a very loud boom i thought it was part of the show i looked behind me and i saw a woman fall forward bleeding
100429 i saw the barrel of a shotgun i didnt see the man
100430 this is real we have to get down and we have to get out
100431 we crawled as fast as we could toward the exit
100432 i didnt know at the time if id been shot or not
100433 i only saw my daughters faces and the floor my older daughter said mommy whats happening i told her theres a man with a gun hes killing people we have to get out
100434 i went into survival mode my mind was completely clear
100435 then we heard the sirens police arrived i heard the police radios all around me
100436 stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
100437 i enjoy seeing them gain hard skills and learn how to use tools it helps them be self sufficient
100438 i will fall out of my chair in surprise if theres an avalanche of people taking advantage of this
100439 theyre begging people to come forward to deport themselves it kind of shows that the whole system has just collapsed
100440 this is a distraction from what we really need to think about in terms of fixing our immigration system weve got a mismatch between the supply of legal immigration from our government and the demand for legal immigration from our economy and families wanting to be reunited
100441 so jimmy how do we get rid of these people
100442 i dont know jules it would be impossible to round up 12 million people even with the help of the minutemen maybe we should offer them 50 cent coupons to the dollar store to come forward and a michael chertoff collectible bobble head as a parting gift
100443 hey ive got an idea jimmy what if we ask them really nicely pretty please with a jalape o on top
100444 nothing not a thing just a promise not to be mean to them as they leave well sell it as a kinder gentler deportation brought to you by the compassionate conservative government of george bush
100445 thats brilliant jules and after all the fugitive aliens are gone well expand the program to the other 11 5 million illegal immigrants who have been waiting for a personal invitation from uncle sam to leave but i have to admit im a little worried about the fact that many of these folks have american children here and little to return to in their native countries but poverty and struggle
100446 jimmy my boy thats a problem for the next president
100447 the civil verdict will take away the means to continue in crime giving the money to arizonas citizens
100448 the whole thing is suspicious because the police department and the attorney generals office get a cut of the action
100449 when girls who had no idea what this place was came in to interview hed attempt to get them to perform sexually with him
100450 the thinking was that if he could overcome the girls resistance they would probably have sex with a stranger

100468 we hebben onze inschatting gebaseerd op een gewone week in mei of in juni en we geloven dat dat representatief is voor het beeld over een jaar
100469 we hebben de schatting voorzichtig opgesteld om dubbeltellen te voorkomen ik zou eerder willen zeggen dat de telling misschien wel aan de conservatieve kant is
100470 wat we in de vs veel zien is dat de laptop uit de tas moet en dan wordt vergeten of per ongeluk wordt omgewisseld met een notebook van een andere reiziger

100635 it was the car to have when you had reached a certain point in your life when you were successful
100636 now its is it going to be efficient and reliable transportation maybe its also a function of age but it doesnt have to fulfill anything in me it just needs to be what it is a mode of transportation
100637 what are the neighbors going to think when they see the car is it going to impress them
100638 when it comes to buying a car people take leave of their senses
100639 you wear your car like you wear a ralph lauren suit
100640 theres a certain status that comes with a jag or a bmw but you really have to leave that at the door the ego part

100645 thats one of the things that has endeared him to alaskans and frustrated the rest of america
100646 its going to be a contest over whether he had the intent to conceal this
100647 given that he paid for some of it i dont think thats in dispute he has a defense to put forth to a jury and to some extent thats going to undercut the governments contention that he intended to conceal all this

100655 it is my understanding that ms spears is reluctantly agreeing that we extend the temporary letters of conservatorship
100656 if im honest its taken a while but its nice to get past 200 but i should have done it 15 or 20 tests ago
100657 at this time statistics dont mean that much to me maybe when im older ill sit down and look at them
100658 but i want to take a lot more than that for the team and i want to perform better than i have before and i want to keep improving
100659 at this moment in time im not driven by statistics or records i just want to do well

100665 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
100666 the scientific community is really going to run with this
100667 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
100668 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
100669 we took into consideration the ethical problems that caused him to be fired as professor and the fact that he was indicted on charges of illegally trading in human eggs
100670 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
100671 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
100672 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
100673 for a long time china has pursued a military policy that is defensive in nature it will never seek hegemonism chinas development will in no way affect or threaten the interests of others
100674 we took into consideration the ethical problems that caused him to be fired as professor and the fact that he was indicted on charges of illegally trading in human eggs
100675 were still under a lot of pressure to get a park that is our own so my hope is that well find a way to make it happen
100676 yao said nothing inflammatory and ron didnt sound mad with his remark more pot stirring by the bee about very little
100677 if artest didnt want to be here they had to find a way to get rid of him
100678 we know how talented he is and the rockets gave up a lot for him hes a great player and he can do a lot for houston but you dont know what youre going to get out of him

100680 i want to pass the torch onto the younger guys i want to teach these young guys how to play the game how to get the most out of themselves how to approach game situations and how to practice how to work hard
100681 my four kids and wife have friends here my cousin and my church is here i already know kings basketball president geoff petrie and the team owners maloofs and what they expect out of me
100682 every time i step on that court im going to still play the same way that i played when i was here they wont get anything less than that from me
100683 my thing is not to come in and look at it like im furthering my career
100684 im probably going to play two years beyond next season depending on how my body feels but just probably at the minimum ive made my money i just want to be around get two more years in then learn the coaching aspect of it and try to be a coach after two years
100685 we had this conversation about three years ago in the summer time
100686 petrie and basketball vice president wayne cooper asked me what i wanted to do and i said i wanted to coach i said maybe i can come back in the last year of my deal coach and play and end up coaching for a team that i had my longest tenure for and then work my way up the ranks im looking forward to it

100690 then nothing was going right on the field we kept losing losing losing we couldnt get in a zone running the ball or passing the ball it was like a black cloud was over us nothing would go right especially for me
100691 he was frustrated with his injuries and he was frustrated with us losing as i would expect any good player to be
100692 we use him everywhere we can in the running game of course and in the passing game well use him everywhere possible as a deep threat as a short threat as a crossing threat
100693 youve got to get out there and get off the ball quick you definitely have to be moving out there when hes behind you
100694 i feel i have the whole package whatever they want me to do i can do it i just have to keep working
100695 i would go out and take lessons once a week and just loved it
100696 when we saw the cross country at the olympics i was hooked youre a little kid you have big dreams
100697 hes fitter stronger healthier than hes ever been in his whole life
100698 it definitely has to be a bond it has to be a connection
100699 what we ask horses to do they have to have a lot of trust in a rider to go over blind drops 6 1 2 feet down into the water
100700 most people dont realize how much is involved how complicated it can be to ride really well to reach the top levels of the sport
100701 shes a go getter one of those type a driven cheerleader involved in school a couple of sports
100702 a warm open wonderful personality it could not happen to a better person
100703 in terms of the other nations were a little bit of a sleeper i dont think people will see us coming
100704 instead of being the ones to beat were a little bit waiting in the woods and have a good chance for a medal
100705 ill be really focused on the competition and my job
100706 then i can let down a little bit take in the olympic experience
100707 i guess it was noticeable and rest was what was prescribed
100708 im just trying to protect myself as much as i can
100709 i just wanted to get out here today just so i could get back in practice i dont really like sitting out and watching guys bust their behinds when i can be out there doing something just anything out there i can help
100710 when i drop somebody i look to see what ray wants
100711 with the economy the way it is its getting tougher and tougher for parents to come up with the extra money to help pay for equipment
100712 the money weve received will help alleviate some of the cost for some of the girls parents in our entire program from the varsity to the junior varsity thats why we are very thankful for the award
100713 a variety of artificial turf products were evaluated for risk exposure to lead and the bottom line is parents should not be concerned about harmful levels of lead in artificial turf
100714 in fact no one has contacted us or anyone at our school district to let us know if there was a problem
100715 the only problem weve had is how to better use the machine to fluff up the turf in terms of it being a health issue weve have not learned of any issues
100716 my quick take is that the cpsc study is fatally flawed and were going to continue to pursue our case because lead is a threat to children playing on artificial field
100717 peinlicher lapsus beim us sender cnn hat seine berichterstattung ber nationalistische krawalle in belgrad teilweise mit bildern aus budapest illustriert
100718 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
100719 i received considerable feedback and plan to deliberate over the information and make a decision in the next two weeks
100720 certainly the reduction in the dollar amount presents a challenge but were hopeful to do the best with what were given
100721 even if they decide not to fund the full amount of 70 000 we should give some money
100722 i think in terms of prioritization that the funds could be shared more equitably among the agencies
100723 the heart of the matter is whether the grants can be used to fund a town funded institution
100724 you have to make some tough decisions and thats why we did the extensive and comprehensive review of all the projects
100725 the armstrong court beautification project in my mind did not stand up to the due diligence test we have required of all our applicants
100726 its not that i feel the project shouldnt be done but it wasnt presented to us in a complete enough format to convince me that it was ready to go
100727 the truth of the matter is without direction from the owner the hamilton avenue school building committee in regard to the over 450 requests for information over 200 proposed change orders hundreds of design sketches numerous changes and bulletins and the delay in issuing change orders
100728 there is no way this project could have been completed in a timely manner
100729 this trend of blaming the contractor for all the issues which have surfaced is somewhat bewildering
100730 im tired of talking about it but i will say we totally disagree
100731 we are dependent on worth to step up and complete this job now
100732 there was never enough money allocated by the town in the first place
100733 remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
100734 were certainly very pleased to see the positive financial results
100735 it is quite a crowning achievement for the board and staff at the witherell
100736 weve been working on this target for the entire year
100737 the goal was to become a self sufficient department and thats what weve become
100738 when we announced the results there was a general feeling of pride accomplishment and achievement
100739 its frustrating de la rosa feels it everyone feels it
100740 it was a bad ballgame francis is on his way back and has done everything we could have asked on his rehab assignment
100741 its tougher to take when you see how good de la rosa can be
100742 hes a lefty throwing 94 mph you see its there and sometimes he just cant throw strikes
100743 it was alans residence and he had an expectation of privacy but somebody absconded with his personal property by going into his home without a warrant
100744 theres no immediate health issue so were going to keep the children there
100745 what if the wind is blowing that way what happens
100746 its just a routine summer capital project going on with all the appropriate precautions nothing going on in the school has any impact on the availability of the field
100747 the discussion was around the field we of course were very happy to make it available to them should they decide they wanted to use it
100748 i try to get just a few items before school starts and wait for sales in september to do the bulk of the clothes shopping
100749 you need the day 1 photo opportunity outfit and backpack
100750 the one thing i wont skimp on is a good quality backpack
100751 were lucky in that my kids are still young and i dont have to worry about the big tech items like laptops or things like that yet
100752 certainly the retail sector is suffering from the woes of the current economy however spending money for school supplies and clothing seems more of a necessity than a luxury i believe consumers will buy maybe just not as much and maybe not the higher end items
100753 with the price of gas some people may not want to travel as far which is good for small stores like this
100754 that has room for a lunch box and i want to put a superhero keychain on it
100755 i just want my best friend jennifer in my class and to go on the red spinning thing on the toquam playground
100756 it is impossible to accurately identify the species of animal from the photo
100757 you are all seriously the best support team of all time i love you all so much
100758 but in reading this thread i do not encourage any of you to send in photos of yourselves in support of me
100759 it will prompt people to write even more articles implying that i have
100760 that is the last thing i want you intention behind it is so sweet and thank you for all have the courage to want to go to the extremes for me
100761 but imm urging you to not go ahead with the project
100762 your support means so much to me so thank you for that x x
100763 there has been a lot of controversy over jess and her private pictures so to show some support to jess the members have decided to create this project
100764 remember lets make it funny if youre doing a video clip go all out watch the chris crocker leave britney alone video if you havent
100765 you can either write the words on you or take the picture and edit to add text
100766 there is currently no time limit for this project but the sooner you send in the picture video clip the better
100767 i think were all just sick of the girls getting all this bad publicity just because theyre famous
100768 i think this is a brilliant idea and hopefully it will get jess to laugh or at least smile then it will all be worth it
100769 may it turn out to be a wonderful thing fingers crossed
100770 i love this it feels good to do something to help jess out
100771 lets just say were expressing our love and support for jess through the art of photography its art
100772 mein sohn ist alt genug das geht sie berhaupt nichts an
100773 what happened at chernobyl cant happen again were looking out for it
100774 i dont like playing under control but i dont want to do anything bizarre to hurt myself i wish i could do the things i did last year but my leg is not letting me do that yet
100775 just because we didnt make a big move doesnt mean we arent trying i like our chances
100776 but obviously anytime you add manny ramirez to a lineup its better they are going for it too
100777 manny is one of the greatest hitters of all time
100778 it will be interesting to see how all the pieces fit together
100779 its disappointing that we didnt get someone but no starter was traded thursday
100780 i think we can win the division but we are going to need help from everybody here and probably some guys who arent here yet
100781 he had eight strikeouts and just two walks in his last outing
100782 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
100783 nur die eu weite harmonisierung der tabak und mehrwertsteuer und damit eine ann herung der preise hilft im kampf gegen den schmuggel
100784 we know from research data collected on the area and from what has been discussed here today that for all kinds of reasons some teenagers with very high potential are forced out of high school before they get the opportunities they deserve
100785 we are looking at 20 or 30 years of ongoing skills retention problem if we dont start now
100786 it is important to start with the young people in schools
100787 this shows our claims on emissions are simply a big lie
100788 the government has known about this for a very long time but has just refused to face up to it
100789 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
100790 it cant be absolutely precise but it is a best estimate of where we are it is very much in line with other studies on the subject so we are fairly confident of it it is very interesting background information
100791 would not want to be held to an international target on it
100792 holding china and india responsible for emissions from manufactured goods they sell to us is going to prove very hard to negotiate
100793 it would be much easier to base any future deal on emissions at the point of consumption that feeds into the equity debate in which poor countries will be allowed to increase their co2
100794 its at the very least misleading for the uk government to claim reductions while we export our emissions this is a problem no government wants to face
100795 in emissions terms we are constantly battling against increases of wealth every year we dont even manage to improve our energy efficiency to keep up with wealth increases let alone to cut emissions
100796 theres a very fundamental problem here that no one really wants to talk about
100797 wir wollen die marktf hrerschaft im premium preissegment ausbauen die weltweite marktdurchdringung verbessern und die erfolgreiche marke gigaset st rken
100798 bei der auswahl des partners f r shc waren uns standort und besch ftigungssichernde ma nahmen besonders wichtig
100799 theres no reason to think that suddenly theres 30 percent more people who have suddenly had this inner feeling to help out people and whats changed its the economy
100800 the donors will make in the area of 7 000 and the surrogates will make anywhere from 20 000 to 30 000 plus
100801 we really try to have people who donate for altruistic reasons thats the best of all worlds sometimes you cant be absolutely certain you can only be certain of what a person tells you
100802 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
100803 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
100804 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
100805 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
100806 if possible i want to reduce the fuel price right now be patient the government will announce it later
100807 the government is studying several matters before making the announcement
100808 i think if the trend of oil prices continues downwards it is only right that it is reflected in domestic prices there is a desire for us to reflect the current market situation
100809 if oil prices remain between 120 dollars a barrel and 125 dollars a barrel for two weeks
100810 german consumers are now increasingly sending out the sos signal
100811 this does not mean that john q public will go on a shopping spree in the months to come
100812 the german consumer simply cannot be a match for declining export and investment activity in no way
100813 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
100814 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
100815 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions
100816 im pleased to say that talks towards a merger with iberia are under way
100817 this is good news for both airlines our shareholders and our customers
100818 in korea it used to be the tradition for children to look after their parents
100819 but society has changed and i want my children to be free of this burden so i need to live as long as possible
100820 but the korean family structure is becoming more nuclear women are pursuing their own careers and people are no longer able to look after their elderly relatives
100821 the type of care that used to be done by individual families is having to be taken over by the state
100822 the increase in insurance payments will mean the burden on individuals will decrease and those who were trapped into having to care for relatives will be free to work
100823 i dont want to be a bit part player but that ultimately is down to me and how well i play
100824 im not here to make up the numbers im getting to the end of my career but i still have the hunger to do well and i cant wait to get started
100825 hopefully my experience can help those around me i did that at luton last year and i like passing on the things ive learned throughout my own career
100826 at my age chances are few and far between and im delighted to be here
100827 its a great club and with the way the team finished last season i think we can do really well next year
100828 i bring a lot of experience to the table hopefully i am able to pass on my knowledge to the younger players here
100829 its difficult to judge how youre doing from pre season friendlies theyre about getting fit so you cant really read too much into things yet you judge yourself from the start of the season
100830 im definitely confident were going to do well because its a young squad here and with a lot of talent and were all raring to go we just want the serious stuff to start
100831 were not expecting him to play 54 games and 90 minutes every game
100832 when hes out there were looking for him to make an input by helping to bring on the other forwards weve got at the club with his experience and knowledge
100833 the chairman said i could have 500 000 of the proceeds and spend it whichever way i felt fit
100834 fortunately we got him at a reasonable price and i was able to spend some more money on simon walton whos still only 19 and i think hes got a big future ahead of him
100835 we might have to go into the loan market again as the season progresses but this will probably be the squad that starts for me
100836 after speaking to the gaffer hearing what he had to say and seeing the set up here my mind was made up
100837 it was a big decision for me to make coventrys the team i supported as a kid and my dad donato also played for them but i felt qpr was the right move for me and hopefully thatll prove to be the right decision
100838 queens park rangers there will be plenty of new faces on the pitch at loftus road this season but unfortunately for rangers supporters most of gary waddocks signings who come from all corners of the globe are untried both in this country and at this level expect to see a new face in the home dugout if they do not gel quickly into a winning side last season 21st this season could go down
100839 best paid actor i no marriage for hilary duff and joel madden
100840 visit her again the next time i come through town
100841 this was a great opportunity for our children to learn entrepreneurial skills while contributing to an innovative fundraising effort
100842 the elephant death rate from poaching throughout africa is about 8 percent a year based on recent studies which is actually higher than the 7 4 percent annual death rate that led to the international ivory trade ban nearly 20 years ago
100843 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
100844 with such information authorities can beef up enforcement efforts and focus them in specific areas where poaching is known to occur as a means of preventing elephants from being killed
100845 but that will only happen if there is sufficient public pressure to marshal funding for a much larger international effort to halt the poaching
100846 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
100847 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat

100870 is her uncanny ability to read lace people come from all over the world to be read by eva and she can tell your past present and future pretty accurately just by holding the lace in front of you and squinting her eyes
100871 they came to get you because you were a woman alone in the world
100872 or because you were different because your hair was red or because you had no children of your own and no husband to protect you or maybe even because you owned property that one of them wanted
100873 no two readers will ever see the same images in the lace
100874 weaving together a variety of subtly interrelated narratives british author hill air and angels embeds a thoughtful reflection on alternative medicine into a taut and suspenseful mystery the first of a new crime series featuring chief insp simon serrailler having transferred to the small cathedral town of lafferton from londons met police detective freya graffham explores her new community and becomes fascinated by serrailler her enigmatic superior though she fits well within the local police force she finds herself unable to let go what seems like a routine missing persons report on a middle aged spinster when yet more townspeople turn up missing her hunch is verified and a serious police search begins bringing her into closer proximity with serrailler at the same time it exposes her to danger a dark but entirely convincing ending may startle some readers but hills fine writing and nuanced insight into human nature should appeal to fans of such masters of the psychological thriller as p d james elizabeth george and ruth rendell who provides a blurb
100875 hill knows how to keep those pages turning in a suspense story crafted especially for women
100876 readers will be instantly drawn to her likable characters and beautiful landscape and will be carried along by the plot right up to the shocking final twist fans of british mysteries will love this new series and simon serrailler as well
100877 its the visitors and people coming into town who should be deterred from parking
100878 theres enough stuff flowing from the city to the people
100879 what are people going to do with their extra cars just keep having to rotate it around the neighborhood
100880 the fact that people who complain about how theres no parking dont think about their neighbor who has four cars parked on their street
100881 if you have two roommates in an apartment who gets to have a car you or your roommate
100882 i dont think it will necessarily solve the problem because we have all the people who park here from group health
100883 i cant leave the house after eight oclock at night or before seven in the morning its annoying because its the summer and all my mates are outside drinking
100884 it is right to say he has been taken advantage of on occasion by others
100885 i know everyone and everyone knows me i know all the popular people from school so no one gives me any bother
100886 people are just twisting it the newspapers have been making it up about me
100887 i did it of my own free will the house was derelict and people never suspect me because of my condition
100888 i knew they would have been poor so i didnt bother
100889 ive got no ambitions i just like hanging out with my mates
100890 i have been into toon the bigg market and all that and get people coming up to me they want to shake my hand and ive had some drinks bought for me
100891 theyve got it all wrong about him hes hardly public enemy number one hes a good lad
100892 im disgusted i think he should be in prison for it
100893 im not that bothered ill just have to stick it
100894 i would withdraw from public life and make certain gestures and in return the us would fulfil its commitments
100895 my commitment was to withdraw and not to endanger in any way the implementation of the dayton agreement to withdraw even from literary life
100896 i believe that its very important for my fate for my legal position
100897 i have to show why im appearing before this court only now not in 1996 or 97 or 98 when i had the intention of appearing here my life was in danger of being liquidated because i had made a deal
100898 if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence in this court i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach me here
100899 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
100900 self representation is indeed a right but if mr karadzic uses that to obstruct trial proceedings as mr milosevic did then the court should step in and take action
100901 speed matters in a showdown between gunslingers but it has no place in court
100902 scenes from hell written on the darkest pages of history

100907 the nationwide data indicates that there is ongoing major downward pressure on house prices from extremely weak market activity stretched buyer affordability and tight lending conditions
100908 indeed it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south
100909 price of oil is dictated to a large extent by u s oil companies
100910 i was shocked to see what it looked like myself
100911 obviously you hate to jump to tommy john right off the bat
100912 but i think its to the point where its kind of foolish to try to rehab for five months and try to let it heal that way i think the damage is beyond trying to heal itself
100913 if he has surgery im going to obviously do all i can to try to come back next year and help this team win
100914 you know what those things will take care of themselves
100915 i want to come back and be strong next year and whatever happens happens
100916 the surgeries today are pretty good as far as coming back at 100 percent
100917 im not really concerned with if i have it am i going to be 100 percent after the surgery
100918 its hard to sit here and not play when you feel fine
100919 but at the same time if i go back behind home plate and catch a foul tip in the mask and im not completely healed its going to make my concussion a lot worse
100920 i just need time to rest just make sure be overly cautious i think monday will be a week i think thats what youre trying to shoot for
100921 hes gone through heck this year didnt he win 11 games two years in a row
100922 it was nice to get back to someone this close to the area
100923 matt and i have had a knack for promoting shows this is the big show
100924 i have kids its just a good gut check things could be a lot worse it makes me realize how fortunate i am
100925 thats the main reason why i keep doing it its for a great cause
100926 you usually see it in the elderly or older adults
100927 she called and asked me if i was interested in filling out an application for rock for life
100928 we have to authorize and approve everything that is spent
100929 i was wondering what was going to happen with the baby waiting to see if he moved
100930 he comes in and says theres no easy way to tell you this but your son maybe has some kind of heart defect
100931 they werent sure if it was a hole in his heart or what but there was blood and fluid all around his heart
100932 i was actually showing what was wrong with the baby because he couldnt show it
100933 but the doctor told him youre going in that room because your baby is going to have a 25 percent chance of making it out of that room alive he said it didnt look good and he wasnt going to sugar coat it for us
100934 but i said no my baby will be fine i felt it
100935 i knew as soon as they cut him out that he was going to make it
100936 i stayed at allegheny general and they said they would call when the surgery was over
100937 it seemed like eternity but they called and said he was out of surgery that he was doing better
100938 and from there it was just a matter of him getting bigger and stronger
100939 hes five months old and he should be doing more than hes doing
100940 i dont ever want to think hes perfect because i dont know whats going to happen right now hes doing well
100941 were just going day by day we never know whats going to happen or whats going to come our way
100942 a martian watching tv drama of late would probably conclude that the country is crawling with homicidal islamophobes desperate to kill those few muslims who have not already been interned by the government or shot by the police
100943 murderous christian fundamentalists like the ones on bonekickers are frequently on tv but their islamic counterparts rarely make an appearance our tv controllers have a tendency to make like the three wise monkeys when it comes to muslim extremism hear no evil see no evil broadcast no evil
100944 you can wonder whether a slowing economy will draw down inflation by itself but the point is that we must prevent inflation expectations changing we must make clear that we are guarding against expectations rising because if they do so then they will be factored into wages and prices
100945 an ugly combination of weak gdp growth poor international competitiveness and rising government borrowing costs could lead to renewed calls for italy to leave the euro as things stand not only will italy lose ground to the rest of the eurozone it should soon start to do so at an even more rapid rate
100946 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
100947 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
100948 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
100949 according to initial estimates there have been more than 260 civilian casualties in july of this year higher than any other month in the past six years
100950 the increased number of air strikes by international military forces which are up by approximately 40 per cent on last year has also contributed to the rising civilian death toll
100951 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north north west and central afghan istan including to provinces close to and bordering kabul
100952 the humanitarian challenge in afghanistan continues to grow in the past six months alone criminal gangs have attacked 12 un humanitarian convoys resulting in the loss of food for thousands of the poorest families
100953 the overall view is that we are seeing more violence but pretty much in the same places some times it expands into new areas but when it does it tends to be temporary
100954 we have gone from 30 000 to 50 000 troops and we are generating more activity because we are taking on the insurgents
100955 a large proportion of the violence has been caused by cross border activity
100956 this year it has become even easier for the insurgents to move across the border from pakistan which they are able to use as a safe haven
100957 our very brand is based on people being safe accordingly your government will not tolerate any action that will tarnish our country
100958 to any small island developing state this figure is astronomically high these criminal deportees with skills developed and nurtured in the us and the uk are impacting tremendously on our society
100959 we are not going to go down the fast food lane and do things that are not in the long term interest of the brand and the experience

100962 just a few years ago hiv aids raged out of control
100963 an entire continent was caught in the pandemics merciless grip in countries like botswana aids had cut the average life expectancy by 15 years
100964 hiv aids is still one of the worlds greatest humanitarian challenges no question about it but it is a challenge were meeting and a lot of it has to do with pepfar
100965 this new legislation will expand access to lifesaving anti retroviral drugs prevent millions of new hiv infections provide compassionate care to millions of people affected by hiv aids including orphans and vulnerable children and bolster efforts to help developing nations combat other devastating diseases like malaria and tuberculosis
100966 pepfar is one piece of a broader development agenda that is having a major impact in africa
100967 and is giving africans a window into the hearts of the american people
100968 i want to speak directly to those around the world who have or think they may have hiv
100969 a positive diagnosis does not have to be a reason for shame so dont let shame keep you from getting tested or treated your life is treasured by the people who love you it is precious in the eyes of god it matters to the people of the united states
100970 no longer bound by law to keep hiv on the list
100971 defeating hiv aids once and for all will require an unprecedented investment over generations but it is an investment that yields the best possible return saved lives
100972 hiv aids is still one of the worlds greatest humanitarian challenges no question about it but it is a challenge were meeting
100973 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
100974 launched pepfar in 2003 about 50 000 people in all of sub saharan africa were receiving antiretroviral treatment
100975 today pepfar supports lifesaving antiretroviral treatment for nearly 1 7 million people in the region and tens of thousands more around the world from asia to eastern europe
100976 tribute to what we can achieve in foreign policy when the cause is right and all parties work together in goodwill
100977 it says that america stands with them in this fight that our commitment will not waver and shows them americas true face of compassion
100978 the boldest act of any wealthy nation in ameliorating africas disastrous health worker shortage
100979 that allows hiv to go unprevented and undetected for years until a whole family is infected
100980 the generosity of the u s government has helped to truly transform the global response to aids and the course of the epidemic
100981 we congratulate president bush and leaders in congress for their achievement in getting pepfar reauthorized at an unprecedented level
100982 this bill renews and strengthens americas commitment to the global fight against aids tb and malaria
100983 encouraged by the acts strong emphasis on preventing new hiv infections
100984 passage of this historic legislation is a crucial turning point in the battle to control aids around the world
100985 we take our hats off to everyone who helped ensure that this lifesaving global aids bill became a reality
100986 is a beacon of hope to millions around the world living with hiv aids it is an unmistakable signal of the united states continued commitment to preventing new hiv infections in the countries most affected by the pandemic
100987 most significant challenges for the next five years is to scale up the delivery of the prevention of mother to child hiv transmission services and to ensure that all infected children receive urgently needed antiretroviral treatment
100988 we are committed to achieving the target in the pepfar legislation of reaching 80 of these women in the next five years
100989 continue to be disappointed that despite the findings and recommendations issued by u s government agencies a democratic led congress is continuing to impose arbitrary funding directives to encourage abstinence only programs over effective comprehensive prevention interventions
100990 with the amount of work that so many prevention advocates put into the reauthorization process it is disheartening to see global aids prevention policy continue to emphasize ideology in the guise of political expediency
100991 most of the money went to buy brand name drugs that are often more expensive
100992 its pretty clear that the system is working well and it protects african families just like american families are protected
100993 we pretty methodically did what we said we were going to do
100994 key is having affordable and accessible medicines and i think the generic industry has made a contribution in a very positive way to pepfar
100995 the point i will make at the conference is that those statutes apart from their very broad and vague wording are very bad for the central issue of the epidemic which is getting treatment to people
100996 african health care systems were not ok before the aids epidemic and have become better after the opening of clinics
100997 there are now nearly 1 5 million kenyans living with the virus this is nothing less than a national crisis
100998 the only way to reverse this epidemic is through prevention
100999 we have made notable progress however hiv aids rates among our families and communities remains unacceptably high and the impact severe
101000 the survey will provide relevant contextual information which will be used for determining intervention mechanisms for improvement of management of the problem in the university communities in terms of all aspects of the pandemic
101001 landmark achievement that will save millions of people from certain death and prevent millions of new hiv infections in the developing world
101002 sadly our commitment to fighting aids globally has not extended to the fight against aids here at home
101003 past time our government stopped turning a blind eye to our national aids epidemic
101004 far greater support is needed for community responses to the epidemic in black america especially through the minority aids initiative
101005 must develop a national aids strategy and fund hiv prevention initiatives designed for african americans
101006 not just a foreign policy issue if we wish to show real global leadership on aids then we must keep our commitments abroad and take care of our epidemic here at home
101007 most vocal critics have focused on some of its prevention strategies
101008 critics have also questioned pefpars focus on hiv care and treatment
101009 criticized for creating a vertical program with disease specific goals as well as a single donor driven structure and strategy
101010 verticality the program has also been reasonably well integrated with the global and national responses to the hiv epidemic
101011 key challenge for pepfar will be to maintain its sense of urgency and its razor sharp focus on results factors that have resulted in remarkable achievements in the face of enormous challenges
101012 the advances have been dramatic but much remains to be done
101013 served to isolate and discredit that element of american politics that refines hatred of government to a toxic purity
101014 would be a private holocaust of abandonment mourning and despair
101015 preserves the pepfar programs successful founding principles and it deserves the wide support it has achieved
101016 worth noting that the bill includes new accountability and transparency benchmarks

101036 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
101037 it does influence the way you act the way you talk
101038 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
101039 so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currecy hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
101040 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
101041 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race

101057 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
101058 the reigns of history back in the hands of man
101059 weve now finally touched it and tasted it from my standpoint it tastes very fine
101060 mars is giving us some surprises one is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun that has presented challenges
101061 it is about us being very very tough and saying there are parts of our operations we will allow to run down

101066 this really is the last chance for households to avoid the energy price rises
101067 consumers have to act within the next few days by switching to a capped tariff today we predict this could save a typical home 300 400 over the next year
101068 i can confirm that we arrested mohammed dali carvalho santos yesterday near the murder scene i cannot tell you exactly where but it was in a hiding place he had fled to after the murder he has already confessed to murdering cara and decapitating her body
101069 he has yet to show any remorse for what he has done he has not cried or expressed regret of any kind
101070 the murder took place at a flat in goiania near to the university which they used to share until they stopped dating some time before the killing after cara ended the relationship
101071 cara was living with friends at the time she was murdered and mohammed was still at the flat he killed her with a single stab wound to the ribs using a kitchen knife which we have recovered and are currently examining for forensic evidence
101072 we have found drugs but i am not in a position to say how many drugs have been found or what type of drugs they are
101073 we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania in brazil next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance to the family

101076 this really is the last chance for households to avoid the energy price rises

101084 there is an issue over whether it is an officially sanctioned event but we hope it can be resolved we will be delighted if this is sorted out because it is clearly a tournament we would like to take part in and it would be a great disappointment if that did not happen
101085 good operating performance combined with increased oil and gas prices offset the impact of weaker downstream conditions in the second quarter
101086 i dont see why it will help consumers in the long term
101087 and leaves the group broadly on track to make our forecast 3 8bn buy back for the full year
101088 dont waste your time on speculating and wait until the announcement
101089 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
101090 you can wonder whether a slowing economy will draw down inflation by itself but the point is that we must prevent inflation expectations changing we must make clear that we are guarding against expectations rising because if they do so then they will be factored into wages and prices
101091 why dont you go down stairs and wait with shadow
101092 the red and black one is called shadow and the other of course is sonic
101093 well shadow is the more hostile out of the two he is a genetic chaos experiment made on the space colony ark his power is off the chart and he likes to settle most matters in violence
101094 well hes a cocky little run about guys who takes life easy and fast
101095 but im afraid shadow will be the one who could summon more control over his blood thirsty nature
101096 sonic doesnt hardly think before he dose something he just dose it
101097 but the both of them should learn not to eaves drop on a private conversation

101104 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
101105 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
101106 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
101107 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
101108 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
101109 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
101110 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
101111 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured

101130 they just put the camera with me and a girl in the back seat of a limo and had me undress her all in one shot i was trying to be careful with her while pulling off garter belts and everything that was supposed to come off and it was an uncomfortable moment
101131 i had forgotten the reality of the situation i was in the limo driver would obviously have been watching me so i turned and looked off camera left i had all the camera people wondering what i was doing and asked would you mind putting up the shade two months later we went back and shot a limo driver responding to me and it was a big laugh in the movie when i relaxed i realized i could put all these elements in play and thats the truth you relax and you actually sense more

101142 weve been getting more and more calls as more and more hollywood films are getting released in the imax format and weve always tried to react to what our audiences are looking for
101143 we know that people come here to see those mission based films the classic travelogue films that are high in science content those films are increasingly expensive to make
101144 helps us keep the legacy alive with these mission films
101145 we had a multimillion dollar bond that we used to pay for that project
101146 people demand to see these movies in the imax format
101147 the quality is higher and its a much more immersive experience
101148 that chain may have the right to prevent a film from showing at least on the opening day
101149 we have continued to have a lot of calls about the dark knight
101150 but the decision here was that we wanted to try and stay with the films that relate to our core audience the films rating didnt match what we were trying to do here
101151 its a small world but i wouldnt want to paint it

101195 woolworths understands that there is genuine hardship across the transport industry
101196 woolworths pays appropriate national fuel levies to all its transport providers
101197 it is our expectation and our transport providers responsibility that these fuel levies are passed on to any drivers who are subcontracted by our direct transport providers
101198 as a company that depends on transport woolworths accepts that higher fuel prices are a fact of life
101199 all sectors of the logistics industry must work together to ensure that we can meet the challenges ahead rather than unfairly placing blame on selected participants
101200 we maintain the big transport clients who are the ones contracting the drivers to do their work they are basically holding out on paying these drivers a fair rate of pay

101203 this investigation is in response to concerns raised by a small number of staff
101204 we have identified around 25 people and they are a myriad of different cancer types
101205 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers
101206 we really felt that if staff are concerned about it the only way to address those concerns was to retain some consultants and conduct a proper and thorough investigation so we can give them a high level of comfort that there isnt a problem
101207 i dont believe there really is a cluster here at all but we need to take it seriously

101210 tim macartney snape deceives schools who invite him to talk to students about climbing mt everest by exploiting the occasion to promote jeremy griffith and his teachings

101229 the security council refused to allow some members to hold the peacekeepers hostage to sudans latest attempt to derail justice
101230 the us decision to abstain is clearly a vote against giving president al bashir a get out of jail free card
101231 the security council told the court to investigate the crimes in darfur and its members should stand by that commitment to seek justice there this attempt to halt the iccs work is blatant political interference with an independent court
101232 i ran away from my home in mogadishu and mohamed dheere is responsible
101233 one of the most important things i recommend to people is to have multiple locations for the bottler to hook up to
101234 i can run my line speed at around one third of what the big bottlers do
101235 they prove it time and time again with their wine scores
101236 some of these pests are becoming international pests and not so localized any more
101237 in august i have to go around and take a look at each tree to see if theres any infestation and remove any visible sign
101238 there are a lot of problems caused by abandoned and neglected land agricultures very difficult you have to be dedicated im learning about these problems so i can have better success here with production
101239 thats one of the advantages of transitioning to these products but it takes time to learn to use them and integrate them into your program
101240 in the petal fall period when we start thinking about leafroller control we also now start to think about controlling codling moth at that time because of the new tools available
101241 if you can drop one spray on half of your block youve probably paid for a couple of years of monitoring
101242 if youre not using it youre missing out on an enormous amount of information
101243 i believe if water continues to be sent south well just turn into a northern nevada
101244 i think more people need to be aware of this
101245 it doesnt seem to be much of an issue to the southern counties because theyre the ones that benefit from it
101246 we have nowhere upstream to get future water rights for the county
101247 farmers are struggling so they see that the only way they can make some money off their property is to sell their water right and then try to sell their land separately
101248 i went through a lot of expense and trouble to get those rights and maintain them and i think that they should be able to be transferable its part of your estate so to speak
101249 so its not like theyre going to dry up the county
101250 this is just a question of how do you make them work in a manner thats fair for upstream and downstream users its a very complicated issue and its got multiple sides to it
101251 there needs to be some kind of system in place to protect agriculture
101252 i think theres been more talk about that than things happened i think the county because of the talk is attempting to stop that because okanogan county would totally dry up right now water rights are almost worth more than the land is because the farming is not that great
101253 all well need to do is unhook the branch from the top bring it down and play it like a violin into our buckets
101254 were focusing growth into well spaced upright wood thats the way cherries want to grow
101255 the goal is a precision canopy management approach rather than tipping everything
101256 yield potential is as high as you want it to be it comes down to getting the right planting stock the third year yield is related to how much wood you can get in year one all the first year wood is fruiting wood in the third year
101257 i think it becomes reasonable when you have a structure like this
101258 if youre going to err on one side we want more fruit rather than less fruit were learning as we go here a year ago when i was presenting the conceptual diagrams there was absolutely no heading i have backed off i think theres a place for heading but we want to avoid strong lateral growth we want single fruiting uprights
101259 we want to make sure the smaller branches have a chance to grow
101260 you want as many pipes as possible so you can make choices later
101261 i think that suggests that the fumigation treatment is impacting something with regards to the overall soil biology in a negative sense
101262 it suggests that the growers missing out on something the first year or two of tree growth
101263 i think the upper end of the disease control we can expect has not been anywhere near reached or obtained
101264 you have to ask why and that question has not been answered
101265 i think the evaluation needs another layer to find out why something is not performing
101266 were looking at the broader spectrum of the soil biology a lot of the work will be done at the molecular level so we can get a better picture of whats going on
101267 we think its other elements of the soil biology that are not enabling the disease to occur
101268 we know that aitc wipes out the free living nematode community which is involved in nitrogen cycling so is that going to negatively impact nitrogen availability and if so for how long and what impact is that going to have on tree growth
101269 it takes a lot of time its chaotic and its nerve wracking
101270 everything i do is designed to improve the winemakers efforts
101271 ill be bold enough to say that i can improve their product
101272 were more than just a funnel and a hand corker
101273 the rest of the time that machinery is sitting in a wet caustic environment and thats hard on equipment
101274 we had mainly apples and cherries on our farm then we switched 15 acres over to grapes in 1999 and started making wine in 2003
101275 weve been to every province in canada except newfoundland and this is the nicest part of canada weve seen the people are so friendly too
101276 its the nicest spot in the whole okanagan when we were kids we came here and it was the same as it is now theres something about the feel of it that hasnt changed
101277 naramata is less of a bedroom community and more of an absentee community
101278 some people live here only two weeks out of the year when i went to school here there were about 170 kids in the school now there are well under 100 a lot of families are leaving naramata because they cant afford to live here
101279 youre not going to have families that can buy property just for farming
101280 but we have to keep that core community keep the school open and keep the community alive a lot of different organizations within the communitycitizens associations and things like thatare working to do that its a community in flux but its also a very forward thinking community i think it will retain its character charm and diversity
101281 there will be a hue and cry from the community if anyone tries to bring in changes that dont fit in with what the community wants richard said
101282 naramata thinks of itself as a farming community and i support that 100 percent
101283 naramata has been a popular tourist place for many years because of all the baby boomers retiring and the wealth out there there has been a large number of people who want to have a piece of what naramata has to offer its going to result in significant changes in the quality of life here
101284 the problem is if people come here in droves they will destroy what it is they are coming here for in the first place the bottom line is there are developers who see a huge opportunity for financial gain here we have a scarcity of land and a big demand for it the houses that are being built are in the million dollar plus range the older two and three bedroom houses downtown are in the 500 000 to 600 000 range
101285 were doing regional growth planning strategies but many are unattainable and are already obsolete im not antidevelopment and im not antiprofit but as a society we have to put the brakes on were scrambling our brains trying to keep things the way they are and put together a fair development strategy
101286 the problem here is they are trophy vineyards they are never going to see the light of black ink the okanagan is in this wine craze right now its brought in some young people who are bringing in big changes to the landscape
101287 im running 15 acres of grapes and 20 acres of cherries
101288 when youre talking about moving people through the orchard we hope to see some efficiencies of one single engine moving this many people
101289 as we engineered it and drew it up and kept working on it it became too much of an overhanging load to do it that way
101290 not only because of the way its designed but the growers who own this did a very good job of canopy management its a picture perfect orchard
101291 the whole idea behind this project was proof of concept and one of the biggest concepts we need to prove is that we can put people on herelets say two per platformand they can work in unity and be efficient
101292 lets say we get 20 people on and five are slow and its holding the whole machine back we need to see whether that happens or its not an issue when you have one person with one ladder you can control that individual person but when youre doing this youre managing a whole crew of people who need to work at the same speed
101293 if we did away with the apple bin or put it above the orchard we could go to six foot rows and shorter trees
101294 this is a proof of concept this is not a commercial machine
101295 if were able to run it and it works fairly well and it doesnt break i think weve accomplished a great deal i feel it works into the technology road map and takes us further down the road hopefully it opens peoples eyes to the possibilities the point is to provide opportunities to move ahead
101296 youve got to believe its going to work i put a lot of myself into it
101297 youve got to find faster and better ways to do the job
101298 when health is absent wisdom cannot reveal itself art cannot manifest strength cannot fight wealth becomes useless and intelligence cannot be applied
101299 the stockpiles that had been sitting in a fort worth texas warehouse until february already had been offered to gulf coast residents in the aftermath of the storm and were returned to fema without being claimed we didnt receive them and not issue them they were returned to us after they were not used from different areas

101407 sest f licit le pr sident du directoire jean pascal tricoire
101408 i am an unyielding advocate for the well being of children around the world and do not condone or endorse smoking
101409 whether tobacco sponsorship of music events leads to youth smoking is a matter of serious debate
101410 having considered the facts in this specific instance we have decided to withdraw all branding associated with this concert
101411 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big white house
101412 the entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us
101413 national security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues thats why i think john mccain is the guy to keep us safe
101414 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
101415 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
101416 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
101417 for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf
101418 when you pick up a 2 foot 8 inch human being and throw him to the floor it hurts
101419 its not a television or a handbag its a symbol of marriage that didnt happen
101420 safe and clean and in a glass box like a glass slipper
101421 i never said it was cool to just keep it
101422 if she said we spoke about it she just made it up sometimes she thinks she can say anything and ill go along with it
101423 john has such an amazing crew of musicians and friends with him everyone gets along and is drama free and jen fits right in perfectly
101424 are very happy together its working really well and theyre only getting closer
101425 it gets to a point where its too much its too draining
101426 one man one vote now is that really real the name of our game is lets make a deal
101427 every 5 or 10 minutes people get up to go to the bathroom or to step outside to smoke
101428 erics the guy who came up with premium bottled olive juice for dirty martinis
101429 instead of draining the liquid from a big jug of olives you just pour it from a bottle there are eight other brands out there doing it right now but erics was the first
101430 something like a dome you could put over your drink
101431 all we gotta do is put a hole in it
101432 a device and method of use with a vessel e g glass or bottle holding a drink to indicate that the person to whom the drink belongs has not abandoned it and or his her seat and or to protect the drink
101433 its a coaster that makes your bartenders life easier and gives your customer more benefit
101434 these figures represent a committed team effort including community members particularly those involved in neighbourhood action groups voluntary groups and the statutory agencies
101435 there is still much to do to continue this trend but i am sure we will continue to succeed
101436 pcsos in particular spend in excess of 80 per cent of their time out and about and thats been a great help
101437 from this were getting lots of information about criminal activity and then being able to act on it letting criminals know we are about and that we will act quickly
101438 the nags are working well and theres a real sense of community from them as people are able to help other local people
101439 neighbourhood policing is definitely to be welcomed but there is still a long way to go
101440 there needs to be more interaction between nags neighbourhood watch and neighbourhood police to really get it going
101441 if we are to squeeze the criminal element then we need to mobilise the community and utilise those volunteers who take crime fighting seriously
101442 in these figures i see the work of police and other agencies in reducing crime particularly re offending and drug related crime is really making a difference
101443 on one of the days we went out to an island where an old baroque church is you can go in there and ring a bell if you ring it three times and make a wish its meant to come true
101444 at the end of 2007 the roof had been re tiled for the first time since 1890 and the tiles were on sale
101445 i purchased two of them because they were the cheapest item i was absolutely stunned to see the image of jesus christ on one of the tiles
101446 my illness also mysteriously cured itself while on holiday in bled and i truly believe the church is a truly sacred place
101447 das umfeld der automobilindustrie hat sich durch die deutlich steigenden l und rohstoffpreise die schw che des us dollars und die auswirkungen der internationalen finanzkrise sowie die schw chere konjunktur in den usa im zweiten quartal nochmals massiv eingetr bt

101449 it may be the best book ever written about the life of texass greatest gift to the world

101463 the american people are hungry for change but more of the same divisive rhetoric and embarrassing headlines by washington politicians like steve king is not the answer
101464 if we want real change we need grassroots candidates like rob hubler who will always put the peoples interests first from creating new good paying jobs right here in iowa to lowering gas prices rob hubler is a new kind of leader who will deliver real solutions and real change for iowa and america

101499 der kaufkraftentzug ber h here energiepreise belastet den konsum immens er d rfte deshalb im fr hjahr stagniert haben erst wenn es eine entlastung bei den energiepreisen gibt d rften wir eine belebung des einzelhandels sehen
101500 das minus deutet darauf hin dass der konsum im zweiten quartal geschrumpft ist da auch industrie und bau eine sinkende produktion verzeichneten d rften wir im zweiten quartal ein deutliches minus beim wirtschaftswachstum sehen
101501 die anzahl der unternehmen die ihre gewinnprognosen senken ist h her als gedacht

101506 in most other areas the taliban laid down ultimata and fought their way into regions that were at peace and in many instances qari babas ghazni and ismail khans herat recognized as being relatively well administered ironically administration services and schooling in these regions were far in advance of anything delivered by the taliban their energies were focused exclusively on war

101552 when commodity prices and land prices are creeping steadily upward it doesnt increase the business of sustainable agriculture
101553 so substantial right now i wouldnt see a big switch to sustainable systems

101562 john mccain is simply not a relevant variable in this election
101563 this careening from message to message makes them look like they dont have one specific thing they want to say about this guy and that there is no centralized theme there is no centralized message
101564 he doesnt seem to have anything positive to say about me does he
101565 you need to ask john mccain what hes for not just what hes against

101570 formal request of scotland yard for its assistance in cracking the number of unsolved murders still on the books
101571 we want the world to understand that we abhor this despicable
101572 we have found some of the stories reported in certain areas of the press insensitive untrue and have added to our distress
101573 friends we have been beer and blogging it since the beginning of the year
101574 i just got off the phone with my friend chris and we talked about how we hardly blog anymore also about how nothing seems that exciting in tech lately its mostly about google and the iphone over and over are we just cynical or have things quieted down considerably
101575 what was going through her head while she was flipping around
101576 i tried to make this a boy version but im just too
101577 i want to assure you and reassure all of the participants present today that we are on track to host the beast and most successful world cup of soccer ever held
101578 the staging of the event on african soil represents us with an enormous opportunity to showcase our country and our continent said the minister
101579 our stadiums will be ready for 2010 in fact they will be ready before the world cup as the stadia are also the venues for the confederations cup
101580 we have an advanced well developed technical infrastructure our banking and it services are on par with the rest of the world so visitors coming to south africa will not face challenges communicating with relatives abroad
101581 our physical infrastructure is being totally upgraded and will be ready for 2010 in particular we need to allay concerns about electricity supply an accessible and safe public transportation system crime safety and security he said
101582 from the onset we were very clear that should our bid be successful we would be hosting an african world cup not just a south african world cup event
101583 for us this event is about more than sports it is about africa and africas ability to host the world it is about getting out from underneath the welter of negative press coverage our continent receives
101584 it is about informing the world that africa has much more to offer that our people are ready to receive the world ready to host those who come to the world cup and that when they come they will receive a wonderfully unforgettable african experience said the minister
101585 partnership means working together on the basis of equality to advance certain goals which the constituent parts of the partnership share in common
101586 so as partners in this historic sporting event we need to project to the world our readiness and our humanity it is in all our interests the government the private sector and the media to be vigilant about our progress in all the intersecting spheres of 2010 activities

101591 people are prepared for the worst but it is still going to be pretty ugly
101592 this investigation is in response to concerns raised by a small number of staff
101593 we have identified around 25 people and they are a myriad of different cancer types
101594 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers
101595 we really felt that if staff are concerned about it the only way to address those concerns was to retain some consultants and conduct a proper and thorough investigation so we can give them a high level of comfort that there isnt a problem
101596 i dont believe there really is a cluster here at all but we need to take it seriously
101597 tim macartney snape deceives schools who invite him to talk to students about climbing mt everest by exploiting the occasion to promote jeremy griffith and his teachings
101598 abuses his position of influence derived from his reputation as a mountaineer to recruit students at schools for jeremy smith
101599 it is unsurprising that the impact upon his career as a speaker was dramatic and immediate
101600 the national broadcaster conspired with a religious fundamentalist to do a complete hatchet job on a groundbreaking scientific idea
101601 thirteen years later the truth has caught up with the lie
101602 todays verdict is vindication for a project which has had to endure the appalling and completely unjustified stigma cast by the abc for more than a decade
101603 a billboard you have in front of our building we are trying to figure out who you guys are
101604 you mean those marketing people put one in provo too
101605 cancer that word scares the hell out of most people especially those whove watched loved ones battle such an evil unyielding force the mere mention of the word has always made me shiver but yesterday one of my biggest fears were realized yesterday i found out that i have cancer too
101606 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
101607 at the end of last season gilbert played defensive tackle and did a nice job
101608 i think hes flexible enough to make the change defensive end is probably the strongest spot on the defensive team the front is better than any defensive line since ive been here
101609 im used to being over the tight end now im going against guards and tackles 700 pounds combined thats a lot of mass to deal with im comfortable playing at the weight im at
101610 he is the closest thing i have to a brother
101611 hes always been real self conscious about his height wed go to a mall and people would stare at him thats why hes so quiet
101612 during the summer we played in travel tournaments in junior high we were the same height he sprouted him when he was 16 or 17 he shot up close to 7 feet and i couldnt hang with him anymore he was 6 7 when he was 14 as soon as he got to 7 feet you knew he would have a future in basketball
101613 for us its all about making sports easier to understand
101614 but the best technical innovations are the ones that take the viewer on a magic carpet ride they transport the television viewer out of their easy chair at home and give them a sense of what its like to be on the field of play
101615 i remember as a kid watching and saying wow how do they do that the olympics were always the showcases for all of the newest technology roone set the gold standard
101616 we were trying to figure out how you can capture the madness of someone getting on a 10 meter platform and actually thinking that its a good idea to dive off that thing three stories up and go into the water
101617 garretts sort of like the doc brown character in the back to the future movies

101626 i think a decision is a decision whether its a wrong decision or a right decision
101627 its a decision i made and you know im not going to pull out
101628 im not going to second think my decision i made my decision to play here and i shot a pretty decent round today im not going to think about what other people are going to think about me and other things i cant control
101629 im not going to be thinking about that at all because if you think about making the cut thats all you will think about
101630 you think about other players you start thinking about what position you are in and you start to think what you have to do to make the cut
101631 all im going to think about tomorrow is how am i going to shoot better scores tomorrow how am i going to hit a fairway and how am i going to stick a shot really close i feel like a low number will solve everything
101632 it was crucial for momentum it was a good third shot
101633 i put myself in excellent shape especially the first few holes and knocked it in fairly close on a couple of them with a few wedges
101634 i think i only missed one green that was the hole i missed the fairway on the 2nd in fact if i could have made a couple of longer putts it would have been really good its great to make birdies the way we did
101635 i hadnt taken any time off in probably four years ever since my junior year in college i took about a month and a half off in the winter and didnt touch a club or anything i came back out and pretty much felt like id lost my whole game it took me probably two or three months to get it back
101636 i tried qualifying for the british open it really came together for the first time since disney the last tournament of 2007 i started putting the ball in the fairway and that allowed me to get the ball closer especially on the par 5s
101637 this might be bigger than what youll see on sunday with the last group
101638 they cheered me on whether i made bogey or birdie they really saved it for me today and i really want to thank them for their support
101639 a lot of people are coming up to me this week saying i know you can do it it really got me thinking positive it was very good energy
101640 its good for the tournament the tournament is trying to find out how to be here long term

101654 on feb 2 1943 a b 25 bomber on a training mission out of south carolina crashed into the southeast flank of sharp top mountain killing all five servicemen aboard the cause of the crash is still somewhat of an enigma as a war stressed military could not devote many resources to solving the mystery of the crash nor did it have the time or inclination to remove the wreckage from the steep mountainside at 3 000 feet elevation most of it remains to this day a true to life memorial to world war ii sacrifice amid the blue ridge grandeur
101655 the mitchell bomber the b 25 design was called the mitchell in honor of a once maverick air force general looked sleek and deadly it was a versatile design which served in every front of the war no stranger to action the b 25 was personally selected by jimmy doolittle for his famed raid on tokyo japan from the pitching deck of the aircraft carrier u s s hornet it flew as if on rails and was fairly forgiving but just like any big warbird it had to be flown precisely from nose to tail it measured out just under 53 feet it stood an imposing 16 feet and four inches high each wing held a powerful wright r 2600 engine perhaps its most distinctive feature was its twin boom tail grossing out at 35 000 pounds the b 25 could hit 272 miles per hour when called upon to do so

101665 the station area is an important gateway to and from cambridge
101666 anyone who uses the area knows that improvements are needed to make this a high quality transport interchange
101667 i am very pleased this bid has been recognised as a real contender for funding
101668 improving transport services around the station is a priority for cambridge
101669 i know this significant sum of money would be well spent in the station area on improving interchange facilities between bus rail cycle and other modes of transport
101670 the scheme would provide dedicated bus stops for services with real time passenger information and the potential for bus numbers to be increased to meet the anticipated increase in demand resulting from growth
101671 however additional funding is still required to meet the sizeable transport infrastructure needs in the local area
101672 the provision of this sort of funding is very welcome given the scale of the cb1 development in particular the consideration needed for all modes of transport including the guided bus

101677 officers are experiencing an increase in drunken behaviour from young women especially anti social behaviour we get the impression that this kind of behaviour is being perceived as acceptable
101678 a number of experienced officers often comment on how the worst groups to tackle are groups of violent young women
101679 the access of young women to alcohol has been quite a phenomenon in the last eight or 10 years and it is certainly very high at the moment around 20 years ago it would have been mainly men using the service but now it is equal it is understandable after feminism that women will be equal drinkers but their bodies respond differently to mens they are not able to tolerate the same levels of alcohol or the strength of some of the drinks they are buying especially the young ones
101680 alcohol is a volatile drug in the body it makes it hard to control your behaviour and people get into trouble or take risks they would not usually take
101681 many people come to us and say i cant believe i did this when i was drunk
101682 when it comes to young men we know there is a tendency for them when drunk to interpret the behaviour of others as threatening so they react more aggressively as a result
101683 similarly as more women begin to drink at comparative levels to their male friends and colleagues its logical to assume that a minority of them will begin to behave violently when drunk as do men
101684 its not about being a nanny state or getting rid of alcohol but we do have a serious problem and we need to act to manage the harm it is causing

101742 once again we are at st anthonys for the chigohi trophy this football event has become one of the major attractions on the provinces calendar of events
101743 certainly we hope to see a lot of talent from the finals
101744 the sponsor will be providing appearance fees to all the finalists as well as uniforms to the top two teams
101745 after starting with the under 20 we will then host another tournament for the under 17 and i want it to be better
101746 we are focussing on finishing on a respectable position and we will build up for next year
101747 we will not release any players or the change the technical department come year end because we want continuity
101748 we have taken a deliberate effort to work with the youngsters so we needed someone who understands them and who can work and nurture young talent so that we contribute to football development
101749 in the first half we fared badly due to many factors and the bulk of our matches were away at hostile conditions for the youngsters who could not cope
101750 my leg had not fully recovered i had this groin injury that occurred on the friday before we played asec and that was the reason i missed that game
101751 i tried to train with the other players during this week but unfortunately i aggravated the injury and i have not recovered
101752 this is part of life and its part of football there is nothing anyone can do but i hope to recover quickly
101753 so far i have missed our last two matches because of injury and i am not sure when i will be fit again
101754 now i am going for a scan so to determine the extent of the injury and the course of rehabilitation to take
101755 i am seeing a physio and will know the situation after the scan
101756 obviously i will be solidly behind the team i hope that we will get a positive result from that match
101757 its a huge challenge to play against a team like zamalek especially at their home
101758 our advantage is that we are playing both zamalek and al ahly away first and we will meet the two teams in the reverse fixtures at home
101759 with asec we have beaten them already but our focus should be on playing well against zamalek
101760 yes there is this other game against al ahly coming but we should not unduly pressurise ourselves by looking to that
101761 it is important that we focus on the immediate game and not anything beyond then we will worry about the next game when it comes
101762 we have improved game after game and i am convinced we can seal the maximum points on sunday
101763 on sunday zamalek will register the first three points in their african campaign against dynamos
101764 consumers can be harmed by the absence of the checks and balances and safety valves that come from a competitive market
101765 in this article i want to convince as many pastors as possible to sit down and start a blog today if i cant convince them then i want to convince churchgoers to hound their pastor until he does
101766 for most of you anything you post online will only be a small piece in the grand scheme of your pastoral leadership but if you can maintain a blog that is both compelling and personal it can be an important small piece it will give you access to your peoples minds and hearts in a unique way by giving them a chance to know you as a well rounded person you will no longer be only a preacher and a teacher but also a guy who had a hard time putting together a swing set for his kids last weekend people will open up for you as you open up like this for them letting people catch an honest glimpse of your life will add authenticity to your teaching and depth to your ministry
101767 how people blogging are changing the world and how you can join them

101790 wir gehen im laufenden gesch ftsjahr im konzern von einer umsatzrendite vor steuern von mindestens 4 aus
101791 wir werden den starken gegenwind als chance nutzen und dabei im rahmen unserer strategie number one unser unternehmen weiter umbauen und optimieren wir m ssen und werden unsere anstrengungen auf der kosten und leistungsseite noch mal verst rken
101792 wir gehen davon aus dass auch 2009 ein sehr anspruchsvolles jahr mit gro en herausforderungen sein wird
101793 die zunehmenden herausforderungen zeigen dass unsere strategie number one die wir weiter konsequent umsetzen werden f r die zukunftssicherung und wertsteigerung notwendiger denn je ist
101794 wir haben uns deshalb entschieden ein fahrzeug mit elektroantrieb zu bauen
101795 die aktuelle situation stellt nicht nur eine herausforderung sondern vor allem eine chance f r die bmw group dar wir richten unsere strategischen ma nahmen auf ein deutlich anspruchsvolleres umfeld als vor ein bis zwei jahren aus unser unternehmen wird noch effizienter und gleichzeitig werden wir weiterhin in die zukunft investieren

101799 he comes here to play every day no doubt about it
101800 but we are here to win and well see how it works
101801 when i talked to junior he was very honest and thats what we want from our players
101802 he said i have to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
101803 i said were not looking for that guy from seattle
101804 through it all the most ironic thing i think is we have had more confidence and more faith in him turning it around than he probably has well continue to do that
101805 hes a wonderful young man a hall of famer and lets just hope he can go over there and help the white sox out id like to see him do well

101817 as a company that depends on transport woolworths accepts that higher fuel prices are a fact of life
101818 all sectors of the logistics industry must work together to ensure that we can meet the challenges ahead rather than unfairly placing blame on selected participants

101852 this is not the intent of the government when they issue these checks the checks are designed to help comfort the family not add stress and worry
101853 we want an investigation and if this is a policy we want to change it or make an exception so parents can cash these checks in 30 minutes
101854 i am sure every institution has their own procedures but they have to abide by the regulations
101855 i felt the banks refusal to cash the bereavement check showed disrespect to my grandson and my family
101856 even though i showed them a photo from the newspaper of my daughter marcs mother crying over his loss they still refused to cash it before the funeral i hope they will never make anyone else suffer what we had to endure because of their insensitivity to us
101857 our detectives are out there pursuing a number of leads

101877 businesses households and governments feel as if were in a recession and are behaving accordingly
101878 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
101879 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around

101893 the asian tigers are certainly increasing their profile significantly and quickly in the patent area
101894 that is a shift that is occurring in the balance of technological power around the world
101895 we are making progress although not in a straight line
101896 housing continues to be at the heart of our economic challenges and remains our most significant downside risk
101897 clearly the stimulus plan has supported the u s economy during this difficult period and couldnt have been timelier
101898 american families spent companies invested and benefited from strong export growth
101899 substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
101900 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
101901 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
101902 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
101903 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
101904 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
101905 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose

101907 in recent years we have witnessed the benefit that a web site like wikipedia can have on all knowledge
101908 even though they have tweaked a number of rules for the game there is still a substantial amount of details that are similar
101909 its still a 15 by 15 board and you get seven letters with point value

101915 its not down but its marginally up in the low single digits our debit card spending on the other hand has continued to grow and is very robust
101916 we also do believe that the housing prices and the restrictions in credit for consumers have an impact on consumers utilizing their cards

101977 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
101978 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
101979 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

101987 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene

102000 digital advertising opportunities are expanding rapidly into new areas as many of consumers daily activities such as shopping become increasingly connected and microsoft is committed to working with advertisers and agencies to take advantage of these opportunities as they unfold
102001 no media consumption left in 10 years that is not delivered over an ip network
102002 no newspapers no magazines that are delivered in paper form everything gets delivered in an electronic form
102003 the commitment of all five uk operators to this initiative is critical for the development and future success of mobile as an advertising channel the working group and the gsma will facilitate crucial engagement between mobile operators advertisers and agencies to help ensure that mobile advertising realises its full potential for the benefit of all players in the ecosystem
102004 theres a mismatch between the growing impact of the digital channel and the proportion of marketing and advertising resources organizations allocate to it relative to other media
102005 we wanted to create something unmissable and what better way to produce something must see than to stage the first live ad event on tv its about creating talkability on a big scale managing the risk and being seen as pioneers for it
102006 while adspend in the mobile environment is still extremely limited when compared to the budgets allocated to media such as magazines television cinema and the internet the opportunities it offers personalized advertising with very high response rates delivered to a device which is always in close proximity to the individual will make it an increasingly attractive proposition for leading brands
102007 in a world where people increasingly watch programming online on mobile devices and outside the home this study will help us better understand how people are changing the way they consume media so that we can make informed decisions on how to measure it
102008 vmware esxi delivers dramatically quicker and easier installation of virtual appliances this enables our customers to deploy altor s virtual network analysis and security solutions even faster giving them instant visibility into their virtual network activity said amir ben efraim chief executive officer of altor networks with vmware esxi accelerating the pace of virtual appliance deployments in the datacenter the demand for virtual network firewalls also accelerates we are excited to be a vmware partner and support vmware esxi across our products simplifying the delivery and deployment of catbird s v agent virtual appliance via the open virtualization format ovf and vmware esxi is a terrific component of our goal of ensuring catbird customers have instant easy to use protection and compliance for their virtual environments
102009 the vmware virtual appliance marketplace is a great vehicle for our appliance and is a user friendly high value place to shop companies are rapidly deploying virtualization technology because of its clear financial benefits however the potential security threats are often overlooked said juliette sultan head of global marketing at check point software technologies our vpn 1 security solution fully supports vmware esxi implementations so customers can protect the data communication on their virtual networks with the same proven security used to protect their physical networks by utilizing the open virtualization format ovf for our virtual appliance mindtouch deki becomes even easier for customers to test drive and use

102014 wir gehen davon aus dass auch 2009 ein sehr anspruchsvolles jahr mit gro en herausforderungen sein wird
102015 if were going to have any kind of medication that alters or modifies the disease if its really going to change it rather than treat symptoms then we need biomarkers that are sensitive to the illness before a person becomes impaired
102016 in alzheimers we need two things we need to know whos sick and whos not and secondly biomarkers should be treatment sensitive meaning if youve got the right treatment you watch the biomarker go down like blood sugar and
102017 the alternative theory about alzheimers is that the cell replication process gets triggered pathologically and then the cells are programmed to die and thats whats killing the nerve cells not the amyloid
102018 this study all hinges on the theory that its a false signal to replicate that starts these neurons down the path to killing themselves
102019 its one thing to distinguish the sick group from the healthy group and another to see if you can predict from the healthy group who gets the disease
102020 we reviewed studies that performed exercise testing among adults with cancer and found most studies did not follow the guidelines recommended for clinical settings
102021 we also found that studies typically do not report key physiological outcomes that provide immediate information on the fitness level in a particular cancer population or whether the test was valid
102022 several recent studies reported a strong association between increased levels of exercise and significant reductions in cancer recurrence and cancer mortality among patients with colon and
102023 we need to develop a plan for nationally and internationally mandated recommendations specific to the clinical and research applications of exercise testing for oncology patients
102024 we discovered that increased protein unfolding and the propensity of the proteins to aggregate clump together are the major factors in the familial form of als

102030 these findings indicate that spousal smoking increases stroke risk among nonsmokers and former smokers the health benefits of quitting smoking likely extend beyond individual smokers to affect their spouses potentially multiplying the benefits of smoking cessation
102031 this is the first study to suggest that an animals ability to perform a spatial memory task may be related to the brains ability to perform memory consolidation during sleep
102032 these findings suggest that some of the memory impairment experienced during aging could involve a reduction in the automatic process of experience replay
102033 this studys findings could inspire the development and testing of pharmacological agents designed to enhance memory replay phenomena
102034 weve learned that apoe genotype does not tell the whole genetic story other genes may be acting independently of apoe to influence someones risk for developing the disease
102035 over an average of seven and a half years of observation the people who experienced the most significant cognitive decline had a family history of the disease and one or more copies of apoe e4
102036 for this reason researchers should focus not only on people at risk because of the apoe gene but also those who have a family history of alzheimers disease conversely studying those who survive to late old age without disease is important to discover genes that may offer protection against the disease
102037 these data provide further evidence that we must explore other genetic avenues to learn more about who is at risk for cognitive decline and
102038 the book covers all of blenders simulation functionality in depth including fluid soft body cloth rigid body particles hair and much more
102039 we arent saying the move from older to newer neighborhoods is the cause of the
102040 that represents a huge opportunity to think about how we are building our communities and to make them better places both from a health and an environmental standpoint
102041 our mission is to get health on the table when building decisions are being made
102042 this has not been done much in the past but awareness is growing
102043 today typical suburban homes sit in cul de sac subdivisions that empty out onto high volume roads
102044 zoning laws encourage the separation of residential areas from schools and shopping malls by long and often dangerous travel distances elementary school bicycle racks stand empty as parents fear for their childrens safety on narrow or traffic laden roads and pedestrians take risks as they cross dangerous intersections in communities where safe crosswalks are all but nonexistent
102045 a whole new different approach has opened up against the odds against peoples expectations
102046 people could have lots of this stuff amyloid and still play lots of bridge
102047 but if you have a lot of aggregated tau in the brain you cant find your way to the toilet
102048 the data show an 82 percent of reduction in the rate which the disease progresses
102049 they could potentially be part of a cocktail of anti amyloid and anti tau drugs that might be the way we eventually come around to treating alzheimers trying to hit multiple steps in disease formation
102050 this is the sort of approach thats been successful in treating cancer
102051 whether altered thyrotropin levels occur before or after onset of alzheimers disease the neuropathologic mechanism is unclear
102052 in conclusion low and high thyrotropin levels were associated with an increased risk of incident alzheimers disease in women but not in men these findings should be considered hypothesis generating and should be validated in other populations before clinical conclusions are drawn
102053 the differences in low birth weight and preterm births are major factors in the differences in infant mortality rates by race and ethnicity
102054 androgen depletion therapy can potentially have some subtle adverse cognitive effects
102055 these men might not be thinking as quickly as they used to
102056 they may find it more difficult to hold several pieces of information in their mind at one time
102057 treating the disease is much more important than these subtle cognitive effects
102058 as men start this therapy it is important to monitor them to see if they are having any of these effects
102059 if you are having difficulty with memory make sure you are writing things down more if you are having difficulty with multi tasking try simple things like focusing on one thing at a time
102060 there is a study that suggests that cardiovascular death rates may be higher among men undergoing this therapy there is clear evidence that there is an increase in diabetes
102061 many men are being treated with androgen depletion therapy for localized disease
102062 a study that was published just last month shows there is no survival advantage for most men in that situation
102063 men need to decide whether the potential benefit outweighs the harm of the therapy for them
102064 vermont women and or their health care providers may more readily pursue evaluation of symptoms and clinical findings than their norwegian counterparts

102070 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
102071 it may have been illegal but it was not in any way destructive
102072 the film has a poignancy for that reason but not one that needs to be overstated
102073 if you were there at the time and had to choose between who was going to survive the longest you certainly would have chosen the towers
102074 on a personal level i was able to engage with this story and get over the appalling dimensions of that tragedy
102075 i think it is possible to enjoy those buildings for the duration of the film hopefully without that enjoyment being too infected by an awareness of their destruction
102076 a lot of people were very moved i think because of what the film evoked of new york in a different era
102077 i came out to do a question and answer session introducing philippe who was hiding at the back of the cinema
102078 he came bounding down and sir sean connery who was in the audience led what was essentially a standing ovation
102079 sir sean then got up and said it was one of the three best films he had ever seen
102080 it was one of the best moments of my life and a wonderful moment for all of us

102086 stephenie meyers twilight series is the first social networking best seller
102087 seed stage investing where there is significant development needed has put too much time pressure on our return profile

102089 its nice walking down no 18 when you dont have to sweat out a par to win by one stroke

102147 records of the phone calls and e mail messages of millions of americans
102148 so seriously wrong that money alone cannot cure the problem
102149 i believe in retrospect that murphy was alluding to main core
102150 it was then that we at inslaw started hearing again about the main core derivative of promis for spying on americans
102151 8 million americans are now listed in main core as potentially suspect
102152 could be subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioning and even detention
102153 the vast majority of financial movements of any significance take place electronically so intercepts have become an extremely important element
102154 if the government suspects that a particular muslim charitable organization is engaged in collecting funds to funnel to terrorists the nsa would be asked to follow the money going into and out of the bank accounts of that charity
102155 the biggest problems with intercepts quite frankly is that the volumes of data daily or even by the hour are gigantic
102156 unless you have a very precise idea of what it is youre looking for the nsa people or their counterparts overseas will just throw up their hands and say forget it

102161 fresh intelligence assessment of terrorist threats to the continuity of our government
102162 the question was how far back in time would we have to go to make this credible
102163 the rise of the surveillance state driven by new technologies and the demands of counter terrorism did not begin with this administration

102179 a tribute to george patrick robertson one of the truest son of darjeeling hills
102180 nos enfrentamos al peor clima de negocios al que ha tenido que hacer frente la industria
102181 la combinaci n de unos precios sin precedentes del petr leo la ralentizaci n econ mica y la menor confianza de los consumidores han llevado a una fuerte reducci n de los beneficios

102183 una visione che non valutava appieno il valore della scienza
102184 su un piede di parit con le materie letterarie e storico filosofiche
102185 the quite ancient symbol of the ouroboros the serpent which consumes its own tail was a theme used for wedding rings made of iron in rome the ouroboros itself is a symbol of the oneness of creation and destruction in renewal and the life principle which timelessly feeds on its own inspiration it also represents the hope for a lifelong marriage union thats continually renewed
102186 in this way the wearing of a wedding ring on that finger signifies the public proclamation of the union in the daylight in other words the conscious and clearly visible world of human community this correspondence is perhaps even more strongly emphasized by the general tendency to craft wedding rings out of gold which is symbolically the metal of the sun throughout folk history and across cultures
102187 he reads from a large book originally known as the cosmic log chained to his right wrist which contains all past present and future events he does not leave footprints nor does he cast a shadow

102193 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
102194 this is a top forum for hearing important new scientific research and for productive structured dialogue on the major challenges facing the global response to aids
102195 however as is often the case with global conferences like this one the needs of children are too low on the agenda
102196 almost 1 200 children a day under the age of 15 are newly infected with hiv around 90 percent of those from mother to child transmission which is preventable
102197 as a global community we should be ashamed that 9 out of every 10 hiv positive children get the virus from their mothers during pregnancy childbirth or breastfeeding a particular tragedy because mother child transmission can be safely stopped prevention services can reduce transmission risk to less than 2 but only about 1 in 10 hiv positive pregnant women who need arvs get them theres no acceptable reason to not put an end to mother to child transmission
102198 without addressing the needs of children impacted by hiv and aids and of those infected by mother child transmission specifically the iac will sadly prove to be just another expensive talking shop to the millions who need action now
102199 frontdoor delivers an experience that is richer and more compelling than that found on any other site in the real estate category and were proud to be part of it
102200 we believe online real estate is much more than just home search its about finding a place to live and frontdoor gets that
102201 frontdoor exists to give people deep home related content when and how they want it and the terabitz neighborhood explorer and iphone application fit the bill
102202 our users with iphones can now take the frontdoor experience with them wherever they go and every listing on the site is now placed in a context of comprehensive neighborhood information
102203 this relationship means our content and tools and will reach millions of new users and thats a great thing for terabitz
102204 but the real winners here are the consumers seeking places to live and the real estate agents and brokers who have partnered with frontdoor to make those aspirations a reality
102205 what corenet global members are saying is that we applaud the environmental progress the chinese have made but we firmly believe there is a great deal of room for improvement

102220 ads are a necessary evil the trick is to get them as targeted as possible which often means giving up a certain amount of user info privacy issues come into play hopefully a sweet spot will emerge where a little user info can be traded for highly targeted useful ad content and the web can remain free

102230 the major contributor to revenue growth was tea with a 22 percent improvement in production and a 17 percent increase in average prices
102231 these results could be considered satisfactory but are essentially market driven

102362 warnings of u s oil shortages were made before the first well was drilled in 1859
102363 after the revolution in iran oil prices returned to the long term average of 10 to 20 a barrel in real terms
102364 when projected shortages failed to appear doomsayers made new predictions
102365 m any of the worlds developed societies may look more like todays russia than the u s
102366 what our society does face and soon is the end of the abundant and cheap oil on which all industrial nations depend
102367 a permanent decline in global oil production rate is virtually certain to begin within 20 years
102368 oil shales may hold another 14 000 billion barrels a 500 year supply
102369 environmentalists now tie their predictions of declining energy supplies to m king hubberts model of energy production which has been consistently inaccurate
102370 u s oil production has been higher than hubbert thought possile

102374 i was seated here nearby shop when he came back
102375 i watched him let himself in and almost immediately let out an alarm we ran with other neighbours to see what was wrong and found the bodies on the bed and ms kasande on the floor almost passed out
102376 we have put the suspect under police watch as investigations into the incident go on
102377 they must be possessed by some evil spirit that made her do these things
102378 whenever we came visiting she always said she would do something to us that we would never forget
102379 the only thing i have known them to quarrel about was when we reported to ssalongo that she beat the children up too severely otherwise they seemed happy and respected each other
102380 ssalongo had abandoned his wife and children for about one week after a domestic quarrel and was staying in an unknown place allegedly with another woman he would only return briefly to give his wife money to buy food and its why he had come that day when he found his children dead

102400 this is a place that would afford him the best chance to win so we will leave it to the permatang pauh voters to decide we will try our best
102401 however this move by anwar is his way of bringing his own problems to the people the allegation against him was made by his own staff not the government
102402 but we accept his decision and we will face it
102403 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
102404 so far all we have heard is paris hilton and britney spears
102405 i have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
102406 in 1qfy09 punjab national banks reported net interest income of rs 14 5 billion lower than our expectations mainly due to higher cost of funds nim also drifted down by 32 bps to 3 27 the bank reported marginal growth of 5 6 y o y to rs 4 6 billion contained operating expenses and lesser provisions led to 20 5 growth in bottomline
102407 we are reducing our price target by 5 8 to rs 627 per share to account for higher cost of funds the bank may not be able to completely pass on the higher cost of deposits going forward reflecting strain on margin we reduce our earning estimates by 5 2 in fy2009 and 7 3 in fy2010 we rate the stock as a buy with a target price of rs 627 at 1 5x abv fy2010
102408 in an environment where interest rates are going up and the sales are not happening at the same frantic pace the growth of the topline has fallen much more so therefore there would be question marks in terms of the future performance of dlf which now companies at least are agreeing in the last quarter they were not even acknowledging the ground realities if the investor is sitting on a good amount of a profit i think he she should take a stoploss and accordingly bail out of the stock although for the longer term players who are there ten years of worth of land has already been bought in but in the short run i suppose there is some more anxiety and the investor would do well to book the profits
102409 in dlf the stoploss to be used could be rs 460 it is possible the stock has actually bottomed out because its fallen from rs 1 200 to rs 350 in just 5 6 months and this is in a pretty decent uptrend since then and is outperforming other stocks so i would just go with a stoploss and not exit it blindly
102410 we expect consolidated eps to report a cagr of 35 8 over fy08 10 led by robust volume growth and improved realizations at cmp rs 734 the stock trades at p e of 6 0x and 4 5x on consolidated eps of rs121 4 in fy09e and rs 163 6 in fy10e respectively we recommend a buy with a target price rs 1005 based on 5x fy10e consolidated ev ebidta
102411 reliance communications results didnt surprise to that extent as the markets reaction to that so probably after seeing a fall of almost 12 i think there is some value in the stock at this point of time and especially if you were to look at sentiment for the group per se is on the mend on the hard side therefore buying this stock for an upward bounce may not be that much a bad idea fundamentally telecom will continue to move along with the market obviously the margins going forward for all the players will fall as the number of players increases and competition for 3g is going to be international players will also come in at this point of time there is some fair value some value to be had even in the short term in the stock
102412 net revenues for the quarter were up by 66 to rs 10418 million this has been mainly on back of formulations exports growing by 174 to rs 5310 million revenues for caraco pharma has gone down from usd 191 75 million in q4fy08 to usd 108 3 million in q1fy09
102413 we have increased our revenue estimates by 5 to rs 41 848 million for fy 2009e and increase our fy 2010 estimates by 6 2 to rs 47565 million on back of greater traction in formulation exports and active pharmaceutical ingredients we have marginally increased our fy 2009 eps estimates by 9 6 to rs 93 1 and our fy 2010 eps estimates by 4 8 to rs 99 1 we rate the core business of the company at 20x fy 2010 at rs 1482 while we value the exclusivity eps of rs 25 at 6x which would derive a value of rs 150 we assign a price of rs 1632 which is 5 6 higher than our previous price target on account of price revision we upgrade our rating to outperformer

102430 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
102431 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
102432 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
102433 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
102434 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
102435 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
102436 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
102437 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
102438 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue

102447 the massive rise in energy and food prices is robbing households of their purchasing power
102448 fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations
102449 we see that as very good news and as a positive step forward
102450 the reporting by chinese and international journalists through the internet is unhindered
102451 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
102452 at the same time as constantly deepening reform of the economic system and achieving sound and fast economic and social development we will continue pursuing comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system

102469 having said that all three of us were loan arrangers for this and the investment banking fees that were paid out were of course paid out to the institutions paid to land bank pci equitable and onl may pre sharing arrangement kami we have a pre sharing arrangement among the three of us which we negotiated depending on the participation or the contribution of each particular group to the success of the transaction
102470 these are all above board this transaction when i was at the landbank went to our normal credit process all of the terms and conditions that were agreed on have been approved by the board of director
102471 no no because this is part of my job this is what i get paid for by landbank to do
102472 there are other banks that do investment banking transactions also they could have easily asked the other banks to make a proposal if they found our terms to be not acceptable to them di ba
102473 we can explain this as i said i said this transaction is above board it was cleared to our normal credit process

102480 the coroners report doesnt say that police compressed mr abrahams to death
102481 who am i to say mr abrahams was not acting aggressively toward the officers
102482 they intentionally dog piled him it was this intentional conduct that resulted in his death
102483 all those facts support our position that the officers use of force was unwarranted
102484 im hopeful that city of woodland will take full responsibility for the officers conduct and resolve this case without causing the abrahams family to go through the pain of protracted litigation
102485 there could be a motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct
102486 i didnt tell him to do it or that he should do it
102487 thats not to say that it wouldnt be justified or couldnt happen
102488 i believe that closure of that entire matter is long overdue
102489 the fella id like to sit and have a beer with
102490 they thought the closer we got to the elections the more people would be tired that there would be voter fatigue
102491 i told her i gotta depend on you the way you depend on me

102496 when mare delivers that line im not well you go omigod
102497 i thought barbara stanwyck was a babe what a broad she has this scene and its really indicative of why the gary coopers of the world survived they wouldnt act without the walter brennans or ward bonds the guys that did the dance so they could underplay underplay underplay
102498 she is literally holding onto coopers leg what a level of commitment she forces him to act

102501 when i was found guilty i felt like a terrible person like myra hindley i thought people would be disgusted with me but they understood and that meant the world to me
102502 the book is a response to that support i thought people deserve to know the full story
102503 having been one of the few in the early years it was a struggle for people to understand and acknowledge the value of it
102504 people in the dance world didnt think it was really dance that it was a gimmick
102505 and i think our book will move it forward even more
102506 its within the dance genre but its a unique category
102507 we wanted to show how modern dance was really the influence and that it didnt come from circus arts because that has its own history and people

102509 i came here to have opportunities that i wouldnt have otherwise
102510 but im not even 100 percent sure its a direction i want to go in im sucking it up by working at starbucks but would i rather not suck it up just to do something closer to what i want to really do

102519 how old are these children does every move they make have to be qualified and quantified
102520 it is one thing to support the idea or the principle of some kind of organising framework for early years work
102521 but the actual content of the framework is an entirely different matter
102522 what we continue strongly to challenge is the unquestioned assumption that it is both normal and desirable to encourage complex and demanding literacy experiences for all four to five year olds and that it is appropriate to make such learning compulsory
102523 given the impact that this order will have on americas intelligence community and this committees responsibility to oversee intelligence activities this cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
102524 we were only shown the document after it was complete and on its way to the president for his signature
102525 weve been in a conversation with congress and the american people about the structure of the intelligence community since the fall of 2004

102565 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community
102566 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed
102567 i dont think that politicising the olympic games will do anything good to addressing any of the issues
102568 it is only inevitable for people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
102569 and i think in this context we should enter into consultations on an equal footing to narrow our differences and expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
102570 the ioc and the chinese government i think are the ones to be held accountable here i think the blame related for anything related to the politicisation of the olympics really falls on their shoulders
102571 the ioc is not true to its word has never been true to its word and the leadership of jacques rogge has seriously and forever damaged the olympic movement and all that it means to the world

102580 dat is ook een optie ik ben nog zoekende nu speelden we met vier aanvallers maar het gaat om de balans dit was de eerste wedstrijd waarin ik kon zien of de aanvallers bij balverlies ook omschakelden dat kan beter
102581 vlak voor de wedstrijd vertelde hij me dat hij last had van zijn knie
102582 hij heeft woensdag wel even meegespeeld met de beloften en toen kon ik wel zien dat hij vreselijk hard kan schieten ik hoop dat ik hem zaterdag nog kan zien
102583 maar ik vind dat we sowieso vier keepers nodig hebben voor twee elftallen de beloften spelen in de eredivisie en kunnen niet zonder reservekeeper op pad daarom moeten we nadenken over stefan postma traint nog steeds mee red dat ei moeten we snel leggen

102597 at this early stage we must retain an open mind regarding the circumstances and motive but it appears there was an incident in the street with a man who subsequently made off on foot
102598 i dont understand how they could do this to a fallen hero and his family who were experiencing so much pain and still are
102599 not only did she lose her child now how is she going to afford to bury him when marcs grandfather went to the bank to show the newspaper article he gets told to leave i am shocked that this was handled so insensitively
102600 this is not the intent of the government when they issue these checks the checks are designed to help comfort the family not add stress and worry
102601 we want an investigation and if this is a policy we want to change it or make an exception so parents can cash these checks in 30 minutes
102602 i am sure every institution has their own procedures but they have to abide by the regulations
102603 i felt the banks refusal to cash the bereavement check showed disrespect to my grandson and my family
102604 even though i showed them a photo from the newspaper of my daughter marcs mother crying over his loss they still refused to cash it before the funeral i hope they will never make anyone else suffer what we had to endure because of their insensitivity to us
102605 the worst is over in the financial crisis or will be very soon
102606 we reserved more than our competitors so were seeing claims come in in line with our expectations
102607 we dont need a rebound we just need things to level off as volumes decline we just keep cutting expenses

102609 the big oil companies are wallowing in cash and exxon is the most aggressive in buying back its stock instead of taking the risks it should to both find new oil and develop new forms of energy
102610 were investing in any project that we have ready for funding we do that first then the money thats earned in our business is the shareholders money and we return it to the shareholders
102611 these oil companies cannot continue to earn these profits spend a pittance on renewable fuels to move america beyond oil and then block any efforts to shift billions in tax breaks to companies trying to bring about the next generation of clean energy
102612 yes the oil companies are making some big profits when theyre not spending it to look for oil theyre paying it for dividends and who gets those dividends i suspect theyre americans americans who invest in pension funds

102624 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
102625 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
102626 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
102627 it sets up a system of cooperation and networking between different agencies
102628 they are really trying to set the next team up to walk in the door and have a functioning government and they are doing it in a way thats workable for a republican or democrat
102629 all it basically does is bring the old executive order up to date with new structure which is necessary but it doesnt fundamentally change anything beyond that
102630 cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
102631 after seven years of a go it alone presidency perhaps i should expect nothing more from this white house
102632 we believe that this will result in significant operational and strategic benefits to both tmi and idea moving forward
102633 the approval is an endorsement of the groups vision in being the leading mobile operator in asia by 2015
102634 why we have restructured our investments and always do restructuring
102635 for example the way we had created the value of sime darby group when we created the merger sime darby golden hope and guthrie the total value of these three companies before it only stood at rm24 billion but when we launched and re listed the position the value has gone up more than rm60 billion
102636 i always say there are opportunities in our market there are some counters that are fundamentally strong but the value may be down a bit
102637 we must wait and maybe this is not the time to buy

102646 he is my first born and i am devastated that this has happened i feel helpless
102647 we are grateful for all the financial aid and support we have received from relatives and friends
102648 the agency will not be pressured into completing investigation into all the cases it will take one case at a time the agency has reason to believe that this happens in other states as well
102649 everything points to that fact in any case wee has my full backing
102650 it is slander if someone wants to complain about someones wrongdoing there are rules to follow
102651 i dont know what his intentions are but this is an attack and attempt to slander me and distract me from the coming party elections
102652 if you want to win in the party elections dont use such dirty tactics
102653 i deplore the use of such tricks whether by people in the party or outside or through conspiracies with others outside the party

102667 zambia is a new nation to us we dont know it very well before this we only knew most about south africa as we had a memorandum of understanding mou with them for the import of boer goats because of the shortage of goat meat in malaysia
102668 but zambia has huge potential and what impresses me is that they have such a huge variety of sub tropical crops like wheat millet and padi they have indicated that they want an mou with us as well
102669 in a meeting with the zambian agriculture minister i said we wanted to begin cooperation in two fields
102670 the first is importing corn as animal feed because we have a shortage of that they have a large crop of corn and maize which they export and we are in need of such as animal feed
102671 the second is in oil palm which i see has huge possibilities
102672 we import a lot of corn for feed and depending on the quality and the cost zambia certainly is one possibility
102673 our people may come here to take a look at the land and grow corn and maize in this country and bring it back to malaysia
102674 the same goes for oil palm we are already going into other countries so we should look into zambia as well as they already have plantations here
102675 this is important without the dta there would be no incentive for our people to invest in zambia
102676 at present only one african country south africa participates in the show perhaps in the future zambia can exhibit its products as well
102677 when the price of corn went up zambia released part of their stockpile allowing prices to decrease again unfortunately we did not have enough rice to release
102678 but we have since bought a lot more and are in talks with thailand for more
102679 however we have enough to be able to keep an eye on prices as we were made to understand the price of rice will go down a little soon
102680 right now ive been informed by coach john beasley that azizul has to ride the team sprint as that provides him the slot to ride the 200m sprint
102681 on top of that azizul is in very good form to do the job as well
102682 so im just going to be prepared to ride if im asked to it is already a great feeling for me to have done the job to qualify for the olympics were all proud of that and we remain as a team no matter what
102683 that is the way we work we need each other to give ourselves a push there has to be rivalry between us so that we can keep on improving
102684 every part of our preparations for any event throughout the year have been well planned and carried out smoothly
102685 theres only one dream for all of us and it has been the same dream since we started under the programme it is to win olympic medals
102686 we took into consideration the ethical problems that caused him to be fired as professor and the fact that he was indicted on charges of illegally trading in human eggs
102687 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
102688 the acquisition is our largest to date and substantially strengthens our position in one of europes fastest growing and most attractive broadcasting markets
102689 the acquisition will create significant synergies for us as a media house as we already operate the diema group of tv channels in bulgaria
102690 we have historically strengthened our balance sheet precisely in order to have the financial flexibility to seize opportunities such as this the gearing levels that will result will optimise our overall capital structure and are moderate when compared with the strong cash flow generation from our existing operations
102691 i get back at people who disturb me in subtle yet potent ways
102692 the first phase has just happened in guinea a mission is expected to go to beijing in the next few months to meet with the chinese companies about the operational details of this agreement
102693 on their return to beijing the chinese side and chinese authorities and companies will examine the mineral resources offered by guinea which could be the basis for an overall deal worth billions of dollars in investments
102694 the strategic committee has been formed it is a win win partnership the guinean side has put forward really important projects projects which would allow guinea to emerge in the near future
102695 by making bauxite and iron ore available to the chinese guinea could unlock an overall sum of investment that could support these projects
102696 we are pleased to reach this deal as the crossroads deposit is an important part of our expansion plans at cortez the property is expected to become a million ounce low cost producer once the cortez hills project is commissioned
102697 this transaction secures for goldcorp full control of 8 kilometres of strike length in the heart of the worlds richest high grade gold district
102698 an impressive gold deposit at bruce channel with potential for additional expansion over time
102699 development of this strategically important zone can now move forward with our adjoining assets as a single comprehensive project sharing mine infrastructure ore processing facilities and human talent with red lake thus minimizing capital and operating and maximizing long term shareholder value
102700 we are the natural partner to develop the bruce channel with the geographic footprint preferred by our community
102701 my conviction is that this deal strengthens the non proliferation regime it makes india a stakeholder
102702 watching a financial crisis feels much like watching a natural disaster as long as you are watching from a safe distance

102709 it was the depression so i was only making 14 a week
102710 then my angel eleanor roosevelt she was the brains of the whole thing you know she pushed through a proposal to give the unions more muscle i joined the bakers union and right away started making 40 a week and we never looked back
102711 a bunch of old people no music no bar why the hell would i want that i told them its my anniversary i want it at the frat

102714 both our labor force and our budget will tragically have to be reduced

102716 we feel we need our tax dollars just as much as arizona or any other state

102722 he was a little package that provided much comfort for my mom
102723 neighbors could set their watches by her daily walks with her dog people spoke to mom and to max
102724 we had to be in the house at a certain time with no company of course we had our friends over after school but at least a half hour before my moms usual time to arrive home our friends left
102725 so when she came down the street everyone scattered saying oh ho here comes miss rose they knew she would correct them and set them straight on the spot
102726 my mother led her life based on the personal and religious values taught to her by her grandparents she passed those same value on to my brother and me they certainly stood us in good stead as we made our own way into this life
102727 we have kept contact with the children and grandchildren over the years
102728 she eagerly greeted her two grandsons thomas jr and derek she enjoyed entertaining them at home for weekend stays she held them to the same rules that she set for us her expectations of children were very high indeed
102729 she shared her humor and loving ways with club members

102733 if you live in a border community and you regularly go back and forth across the border whether its many times a week or many times a month or several times a year the passport card makes sense
102734 did gene and i hate each other yes did we love each other yes
102735 herzog and a few other directors keep the movies vibrating for me not every movie needs to vibrate but unless a few do the thrill is gone

102740 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima
102741 they are all partners in this governments total failure national responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections
102742 i have decided i wont run in the kadima movement primaries nor do i intend to intervene in the elections
102743 when a new kadima party chairman is chosen i will resign as prime minister to permit them to put together a new government swiftly and effectively
102744 who is going to make a deal with him when they know he cant deliver he is a lame duck
102745 all israeli leaders are the same look has anything happened since 1993
102746 now the illusion of reaching a peace deal is fading away
102747 whether he olmert is still the prime minister for two days or two months we will continue to deal with him
102748 if someone else comes we will deal with them as long as they want to deal with us
102749 everybody knows that there are several ministers who have similar problems to olmert so the whole establishment is in trouble
102750 i dont see a big difference between livni or deputy prime minister ehud barak or netanyahu this is a whole establishment that has prevented the palestinians from having their own state
102751 the number of israeli settlements has increased twentyfold during annapolis peace talks the number of checkpoints has increased from 521 to 607 the continuation of the building of the wall is creating an apartheid system and it is clear that neither olmert nor anybody is is ready to discuss vital issues such as jerusalem
102752 its surprising that energy output has not responded to higher prices
102753 its something we need to wake up to here just because we have it doesnt mean were going to be able to sell it
102754 the main challenges that face barrick and i think i may as well speak for the industry at large are the cost factors

102760 with element we are once again reinventing the extended stay hospitality service category and are thrilled to be working with abu dhabi national exhibitions company to bring the first element hotel into the europe africa and middle east division of starwood
102761 abu dhabi is a great city for elements first entry to the middle east and the hotel will deliver great style comfort design and functionality to travelers
102762 this development is nothing less than another exceptional project with abu dhabi national exhibitions company the location of the hotel combined with our existing relationship creates the perfect setting for the debut of element abu dhabi
102763 element extended stay hotel at capital centre will be a first in the middle east and we are very excited since the current market conditions support the development of element the large real estate projects and strong economic growth in abu dhabi have generated significant demand for short to medium term accommodation for executives traditionally this market prefers the home comforts of extended stay hotels over traditional hotels which is why element hotel is the ideal strategic fit starwood understands the market and our needs making this a perfect partnership between an owner and an operator
102764 abu dhabis vibrant business and development community combined with the excitement and culture of the city make it a perfect match for the element brand
102765 every aspect of element abu dhabi is designed to help our guests be at their best while traveling
102766 we will work with any prime minister elected in israel and we will continue with ehud olmert until the arrival of his successor
102767 we are not worried by the change in israeli prime minister because we know that israel is seriously engaged to remain involved in the negotiation process with the palestinians
102768 we have taken part in the most important negotiations with olmert since 1991
102769 the negotiations have reached a crossroads we do not know who will make up the next government coalition or the name of the future prime minister
102770 if livni is elected the negotiations can continue but if mofaz wins that will be more difficult
102771 this is a great blow to the palestinian authority which has hitched its fate to the possibility of achieving an agreement by the end of the year
102772 with the primaries coming up and the possibility of early elections it will not be possible to reach any accord with the palestinians or with the syrians
102773 olmert demonstrated he was willing to move ahead this will not be the case with benjamin netanyahu
102774 the end of olmert era is a tragedy for the peace process
102775 if an accord is reached before olmert actually steps down tzipi livni will have more chances of reaching a lasting accord
102776 as long as i remain in office i will not give up attempts to negotiate with the palestinians and the syrians
102777 we are closer than ever to a solid understanding and accords

102788 chibuku is brewed in zimbabwe zambia malawi and botswana so next year there might be regional finals where winners from the four countries will compete for top honours in the region

102822 is an area that may have large volumes of recoverable oil we think that the outer continental shelf will give access to new areas we think that part of this constraint on supply right now comes from areas that you cannot go and the u s is one area that is limited to increased exploration
102823 the limits to future petroleum supplies have more to do with politics than with geology and resource availability for example the most promising acreage remaining in the u s is located offshore most of which is off limits to the industry

102851 obviously our catching is highly regarded and was sought after but no deal made sense to us
102852 wed have liked to have done something if it made sense now and in the future but nothing was palatable we were offered pitching prospects but it wasnt fair value for what we were looking for
102853 there was clearly a premium placed on young players controllable players and on draft picks
102854 teams are comfortable holding on to potential free agents who might yield an extra pick in the draft
102855 good hitters out there will swing and miss pitches on purpose
102856 because you start to think oh ive got the guy on this one then you throw that pitch again and bam its gone

102936 public services continue to be transformed by technology improving delivery on the front line and making us more effcicient behind the scenes unfortunately some people seem to take pleasure in knocking public sector projects that involve technology which is why id enourage anyone with a success story to share it with the wider world by entering these awards i know the nominations will all be of the highest standard so im really looking forward to seeing all the winners in january
102937 in my role i get to see how technology is being used in innovative ways to transform public services be it a small project that is helping a local community or a large scale project that is benefiting millions of people across the country we need to get better at sharing and learning from our successes the e government national awards give us an excellent opportunity to do this so i would encourage you to submit your nominations
102938 the awards are a yardstick for uk excellence in innovative government services including those enabling local communities to transact with their councils national online government services for citizens or businesses specific services for vertical industry sectors and government services delivered online through intermediaries and the voluntary sector

102941 innovation in the public services will be essential to meeting the economic social and environmental challenges of the 21st century the whitehall hub for innovation will clearly have an important role to play in building a better understanding of how government can empower front line workers to innovate in response to the expectations of the public
102942 the innovation hub will help find more innovative ways of addressing the big cross cutting challenges like social care and climate change by building bridges between those in public services and in whitehall who want to make a difference innovation in the public sector is about relationships connections and collaboration with all those in the value or delivery chain

102965 the kids will miss you so much and so will william and i you were a great person always happy and loved and had an amazing personality
102966 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
102967 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
102968 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
102969 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
102970 unable to locate spotlight indexing status hd is not accessible read only or mdutil usr bin mdutil is not working properly
102971 he says i have the quantity and he has the quality
102972 you know if you stay out here three hours it must be relaxing
102973 i will not sit here all day and not catch a fish
102974 if were together theres no telling how long well stay he can stay the rest of the day
102975 i do a lot of reminiscing i think about the kids the grandkids all the way back to school days
102976 all the other animals are up and ready when we come to them in the morning except eury
102977 having eury here having the wolves here the tigers having all the animals here really helped
102978 weak jcpc monitoring procedures may allow programs to receive funding without providing services of the quality and quantity outlined in the program agreement
102979 monitoring helps determine which programs are successful and whether limited funds are spent wisely
102980 hey look the raceway is just over the next hill we should still be able to get there in time to see the race start
102981 you say its going to cost me 35 to rent a track scanner but i just spent 154 on two tickets how am i supposed to afford that
102982 excuse me sir this is our first trip to martinsville whats the best way to get to the bill france tower the bill france tower the bill oh nevermind
102983 these are great seats real close to the track wonder why theyre cheaper than the seats further back
102984 this is like the 25th caution flag ive lost count weve been here for five hours well never get out of here
102985 you have to do outreach and public education to get even elected officials to pay attention
102986 it needs widespread support from the staff and county commissioners
102987 the more buy in we get the greater it would be
102988 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program
102989 i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions
102990 the bobcats and the entire charlotte community embraced me from day one
102991 its exciting to enter this season with a hall of fame coach and teammates who are committed to winning
102992 it was important for us to get a deal done
102993 securing emeka demonstrates that bob johnson and the rest of our ownership group are committed to building a winning franchise in charlotte any time you have a player who consistently ranks among the nbas best in rebounding and shot blocking you want to keep a guy like that around
102994 when youre together as a staff sometimes for six years you put something in you put something in and you never take something out
102995 and we just thought it was time to go back and take a hard look at ourselves and take some things out
102996 we tried to simplify the defense a little bit when you have new guys like charles coming in and tyler coming in and the young guys we had obviously the less you have to learn the better we think it is
102997 were putting finishing touches to wordscraper it will only get better
102998 but were certainly not done continuing to look at working our roster to improve ourselves
102999 its not a secret that it was disappointing not only stats wise but even to my personal standards
103000 i did some evaluating and i think i made the necessary adjustments as far as conditioning and getting myself ready to come back this year and make improvements
103001 what i learned over these last six years that ive been here is that year to year its unpredictable what happens with players and contracts and those type of things
103002 im worried about playing football right now im not even really looking forward to next season or whats going to happen after that weve got to get focused on making it happen right now
103003 i played it at north carolina i played it in high school the times i did play defense in high school the left handed stance is my natural stance the left hand is my strong hand there are a lot more moves and power available on that side
103004 barring anything unknown theres no reason he wont go out and set records i think
103005 i was only sick for two weeks i will say during that time i lost weight a little bit of strength and probably some explosiveness and things like that
103006 i feel a little stronger i feel more powerful faster a little bigger
103007 ive got a little more weight im pleased with what i did this offseason
103008 i have a contract to play football right now after this season its a different story
103009 we feel that the tennis in greensboro is as good as anywhere
103010 we think the toughest competition comes out of the local level
103011 were playing indoors within the convention center on three courts that have been laid out on the floor
103012 its absolutely deafening in there because of the reverberation in the closed space
103013 ive enjoyed all my partners and now newly formed friendships
103014 i just had a great time this is probably the pinnacle of my tennis career
103015 the guys on the team are just great guys to be around so were good friends on the court and off the court
103016 weve got a great club that offers three pros that have helped us out over the season
103017 we kind of knew that they had the potential to be top top 4 0s
103018 they definitely have improved a lot and their results are showing that
103019 were going to keep on training and get ready so we can go and represent greensboro well
103020 you think youll find a set of 57 half moon hubcaps in the drugstore on the clearance rack
103021 i think its a compliment certainly that people think i can be a part of the turnaround but the reality is im just a part of it that it will take more than just me its going to take the administration its going to take people filling the stadium up and cheering and creating that electric atmosphere on saturdays its going to take recruits
103022 most of the people that have ever sat on the universitys board of trustees theyre ceos of companies and they understand youre not going to turn the fortunes of a company immediately around
103023 its going to take a vision its going to take hard work i dont think any fans by any stretch of the imagination are into the 10 year plan
103024 its been almost a year since toney has been on the field i thought he did well
103025 i knew i had a great shot to be the old toney baker again
103026 jamelles ahead because hes played and been around and went through the spring
103027 hes starting off at the top of the heap and well see how it goes
103028 were going to gradually work into this and build into it with him
103029 there are so many questions about the magnitude and impact of tariff reviews as well as questions among stakeholders in the region about their obligations especially to the poor who are vulnerable to such increases
103030 it is a sad story and an unfortunate thing because it ends up hitting hard on ordinary people
103031 electricity tariffs have remained very low and are the lowest in the region the low tariff structure is a major setback in the smooth running of our operations
103032 in light of the anticipated high energy tariffs sadc member states should consider targeted subsidies for the poor or different pricing policies geared at protecting the majority of the poor in the region
103033 all of us realize whats going to be going on here in the next 10 20 30 years
103034 right now the only real place to grow is into prime agricultural land for the most part
103035 every day you come out here you see one guy who flashes im looking forward to seeing them under live conditions weve got some young guys with a lot of potential
103036 i love you for giving me the good genes and not my brother
103037 i felt like for the teams best interest and my best interest it was time to watch video of thursdays seventh day of training camp at dove valley view slide show of broncos training camp view slide show of nfl training camps watch video of interviews with mike shanahan and michael pittman watch video of broncos safety hamza abdullah at training camp watch video of john elway talking about this years broncos team watch video of elway paying homage to rod smith read lindsay jones entries on the all things broncos blog ask mike klis about the team or nfl in the broncos mailbag read the latest commentaries by jim armstrong from training camp post photos of you and your loved ones showing broncos spirit make a change
103038 i had to give him an honest evaluation of where we were and what we thought as a staff
103039 one thing you never do to a veteran player is lie to them
103040 i tried to rationalize all the reasons to stay here but my gut kept telling me that situation wasnt right and i couldnt make it right
103041 we knew this day would come we just didnt know it would come this soon
103042 after the last few days he has really come on
103043 you never find players like john lynch from a leadership standpoint
103044 it wasnt a good day not fun at all to be honest with you
103045 i got a nice little walk out here on monday breathed some nice air and tried to figure out what happened
103046 his was the british open championship mine was the senior open championship
103047 but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common
103048 we talked a little bit about it we talked about his finish and my finish it was hard conditions we both said youve got to move on when you have championships within your grasp and they kind of slip through it hurts a little bit
103049 after that start i tried not to think of end results but just to hit good shot after good shot
103050 i hate to say it but it could have been a 61 or 62 i had a lot of other good birdie chances
103051 that was pretty dumb since i had knee surgery this year
103052 i cant even bend down to line up a putt because my thighs hurt so much
103053 this time lebron james and carmelo anthony werent sitting on the bench
103054 this time they were on the court and they are the best players in the game
103055 ive accepted the challenge to become a better leader i havent been afraid to lead these guys
103056 a lot of people would be afraid to walk into an arena with guys like kobe bryant or jason kidd or dwyane wade and tell them that theyre wrong about something to lead them
103057 but thats kind of my nature i think its more important to lead guys who are great than the guys who are on my team
103058 we dont call them young guns theyre rusty six shooters
103059 i cant imagine any performance enhancing for golf drugs being used on this tour
103060 you have your friends counting down how many months weeks days hours until you turn 50 so i never heard the end of it
103061 i will rear back and hit the ball the contact will feel just like it used to years ago the shot will look just like it used to but it doesnt go as far as it used to
103062 thats just the way it is but im not bugged by it
103063 when youre 20 you think you know everything when youre 30 you still think you know most things at 40 you realize you dont know everything but at 50 you realize you know nothing
103064 ever since the end of last year weve been trying to get a proven scorer
103065 we like the forwards we have but as you saw against columbus a 2 0 loss at home we sometimes dont score enough goals when we should
103066 i remember the first day in camp after he came over from minnesota just the blow he delivered to those guys rushing the passer
103067 it shocked me the noise that it made when he struck the defensive lineman on a pass rush
103068 just talking to him the other day he is so frazzled by this process
103069 hes getting up at 4 oclock in the morning hes stressing so much over this because its not about anybody else
103070 its pretty shocking to me that the l a express has as many players in the hall of fame as the broncos do
103071 thats pretty ridiculous when you look at it that way
103072 the broncos have been to six super bowls i dont know what it is but now that im in there it is an awesome honor to be in there behind john elway
103073 you got a smarter player the vikings had a more athletic but dumber player i talk about this all the time when i go talk to these classrooms when youre young youre surviving on your athletic ability and your quickness your recovery time is so quick as you get a little bit older your recovery time goes down and your smarts go up and pretty soon your smarts take over thats kind of where i ended up with denver was the smarts were taking over
103074 during warm ups his shoulder had slipped out of joint
103075 and i went to mike shanahan with gary and i said i dont think hes going to be able to play and zim says as long as no 7 is on the field ill be there he said dont you worry about me ill make it zim is probably one of the toughest guys to ever put on a uniform
103076 the guys up front won super bowl xxxii without question
103077 im convinced that without my team i wouldnt be here today
103078 i think you could carry wisconsin if you can get up and talk to mark murphy and ted thompson and resolve this dispute in green bay
103079 theres a lot of controversies that i have eagerly leapt into in my time
103080 im not so dumb that im going to jump into that one
103081 the bottom line my expertise is on the defensive side of the ball
103082 in new orleans all the coaches were responsible for recruiting individual players
103083 ron thought i would be a good guy to work with
103084 i dont know how they track you down you keep thinking its your buddies sending your name in to them or something right
103085 id be too embarrassed to ask for a discount at a movie right now ill pay full price so nobody asks me if im 50
103086 altitude golf is not my favorite test of golf but it needs to be my favorite for four days right now
103087 i knew right away coming out here that i had a lot of holes in my game
103088 its very very competitive the last three years a lot of players have moved to the champions and we have tremendous depth on this tour
103089 about the last six months there i was ready to go to the champions tour but until then i was enjoying the ride out with the regular tour it was a fantastic experience to play the tour for basically 25 years and be fortunate enough to play successfully
103090 if i had it to do all over again i might do something different id always said that the best thing to do was even if you werent playing well and getting your brains beat in on the regular tour play on it and stay competitive up until youre 50 and go right out on the champions tour because then youre still in that competitive mode in retrospect i probably should have taken the last six months off last year and worked on my game
103091 i played with two guys two kids who my son played junior golf and college golf with and thats when i said you know what its time to move on
103092 it was a little depressing how hard i worked last year and i couldnt do anything my shoulder went out my health got bad and i was a wreck then you have your friends counting down how many months weeks days hours left until you turn 50 and i never heard the end of it
103093 i knew better to be in the licking chops mode
103094 i had enough friends out here saying look you already know the guys who have tattooed you before and theres a whole bunch of them you dont know who can tattoo you too
103095 thats part of the deal weve both played in a number of games so if one guy goes down the other guy has to step in thats just the way it is
103096 thats the first thing mike said to me after he signed with houston
103097 mike is very excited hes got a fresh start with a team that runs a system hes very familiar with
103098 coach would say hey stay deep this kid can throw a hundred thousand yards
103099 hes got a strong arm hes got a cannon im impressed by him
103100 im impressed with brandon marshall and eddie royal those guys dont drop anything brandon stokley those receivers dont drop a thing hard catches they make em
103101 the rumors which began in england about her health are dramatic overstated and untrue
103102 at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
103103 time to get a move on time to get back on the road
103104 hey baby you brought me coffee you get groovier every day
103105 now that hes with us i dont know but somehow we did didnt we baby it may not have always been graceful and smooth but we made it together
103106 yeah i guess you could say we pretty much did
103107 you know it after the film well request your new birth certificate and go from there
103108 you realize youll only have my beat up old black truck to drive around
103109 joe needed to live his life im on the road a lot it wasnt fair to either of us
103110 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
103111 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
103112 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
103113 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
103114 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
103115 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it
103116 we can be here for hours and hours to talk about all the bad things she has done but if you recommend probation she can walk out of this courtroom and go down the elevator with you
103117 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
103118 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
103119 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
103120 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
103121 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
103122 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
103123 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
103124 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
103125 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
103126 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
103127 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
103128 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
103129 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
103130 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
103131 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
103132 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living

103137 british police told the israeli embassy in london minutes before thursdays explosions that they had received warnings of possible terror attacks in the city a senior israeli official said
103138 the israeli embassy in london was notified in advance resulting in finance minister binyamin netanyahu remaining in his hotel room
103139 the multiple simultaneous explosions that took place today on the london transportation system were the work of perpetrators who had an operational capacity of considerable scope
103140 all the bigger artists whose fuel bills are much greater because were talking about fleets of buses and trucks are taking a hard look at their production and do they really need all those trucks and all those buses and all those people on the road or can they do it more economically
103141 because the lower the price the more chance your band is going to develop and the higher the price people will have to think twice about making that investment
103142 some of our members were a bit shocked when they found out about it because they werent in on the fact that it was a hoax but im a big advocate that all publicity is good publicity

103166 if the hypervisor is already commoditized and most of your competitors have a free version then paul maritz did the right thing
103167 you saw how fast he moved diane greene wasnt out of there two weeks
103168 were focusing our efforts on the 20 plus products we sell on top of the hypervisor this is a continuation for us of a long term strategy
103169 in terms of the pure hypervisor clearly esxi is more appealing
103170 i would postulate that they dont have good negotiators in their organization
103171 support is not included with the free esxi if you want that it starts at 495 per server per year
103172 this doesnt really address the typical enterprises cost of vmware deployment just the marketing threat of the low hyper v starting price
103173 if virtual machine manager microsofts management suite and hyper v together meet your needs and the price is lower why not
103174 if you have a lot of vmware installed and you love vmware wow the choice just got easier on the other hand yeah there are reasons to go with hyper v a lot of it comes down to licensing

103373 kami masih dalam proses untuk membuka kembali laman yang sebelumnya diblok

103397 players are talking about accountability and guys are fighting to take responsibility i like how they are talking about their teammates about the team not about themselves when stuff like that starts happening it can explode in a big way
103398 the reason were not disappointed is that this is an ongoing process
103399 will not be an impediment to what we need to do
103400 well meet with the staff friday and see how we introduce the younger kids and who has to take a backseat because of that
103401 they all have a good relationship with the ballclub and the manager and us in the front office
103402 they understand the program they dont have any problem with the path were following
103403 to take the pressure off bochy and to make sure everybodys on the same page he understands that
103404 we did all the work and there was no interest
103405 ive enjoyed my years for the giants ive been waiting for an opportunity like this where they say ok youre going to be one of our lefty guys youre going to help us out of jams in the seventh or eighth and help brian wilson out thats something i wanted here to have the team youre with be committed to you is a boost
103406 but early on i knew that wasnt going to happen it didnt take the last couple of days to figure out that wasnt going to happen that type of player wasnt moved so that should tell you what kind of climate it was
103407 this was not so much a legal defeat for cuban as it was an old fashioned ass whupping
103408 we couldnt have done any better this is a home run
103409 being the tough guy he said thats what i expected he didnt think hed stolen one because he didnt think he was wrong
103410 most host countries treat the olympics as a game but china is treating it like some form of combat
103411 theres almost too much pressure on the people of beijing theres too much pressure to put on a good show
103412 look at how fast were moving its almost never like this
103413 in the bullpen if i pitched poorly i always felt better if i had a day off to see what i was doing wrong
103414 lets say you have mechanical problems and youre not throwing a certain pitch the way you want to if you dont have time to make the adjustment you go out there two or three or four outings in a row you get your butt kicked whereas as a starter you have a few days to look it over and work on it
103415 i mean i want to get back out there obviously because my last outing wasnt what i was hoping for
103416 but its not like im sitting in here saying oh my god i cant wait to pitch again when my time comes my time comes
103417 we did say that it would be difficult to get repetitions for the third guy now that hes getting some repetitions were doing it in a fashion that keeps it i guess you could say in all fairness if hes going to replace somebodys reps hell take those first team reps
103418 i had no expectations about when my reps would come
103419 its strictly about me being ready if they would have said the first day to jump in there i would have been ready if they say it a month from now im going to be ready its my job to be ready
103420 because with the limited reps hes had so far if it was all new to him this year he wouldnt be where he is
103421 thinking about if im more comfortable than anyone else is not an efficient use of what i want to be doing right now in camp
103422 its about preparing to come out here and play well and then playing well
103423 theres no question to me that j t osullivan is tough
103424 hes competitive hes resilient now if he can play quarterback thatd be great
103425 you want to be out there getting the reps but im just trying to get mental reps back there and be ready to go
103426 its going to happen in fairness ive got three guys competing for it
103427 just because of the way reps are its difficult to be 100 percent fair with reps but were doing the best we can
103428 we were having quite a few conversations and some of them were initiated by other teams who wanted our young players
103429 some of the names you saw traded some of those calls came to us
103430 we really want to see it through and stay disciplined
103431 we have a real foundation and were willing to bite the bullet the process is painful and were not going to do something to make everyone feel better for the next couple of weeks we have a long term plan which is why we made the trades we did before the deadline
103432 my focus here on out is to finish strong finish these last two months in a positive way
103433 and also put up numbers that are indicative of where i believe myself to be you cant focus on what youve done in the past because you cant change it
103434 his presence and professionalism is a positive hes a leader and thatll be good for us
103435 when youre facing good pitching you need to find a way to score were getting shut down too frequently
103436 the dynamic is not like that as far as our personnel
103437 other teams ive been on they do that it hasnt happened here yet it doesnt mean guys arent frustrated it means we go about it in a different way
103438 he has to be careful theres a molina behind the plate
103439 i feel i have the confidence to throw anybody out if these pitchers give me a chance
103440 i felt like i grinded really well ive just got to shoot low
103441 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
103442 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
103443 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
103444 there was obviously a point in time that you have to make a major decision we did and we were glad we did it hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
103445 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
103446 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
103447 theres no gray area get your feet in or youre out it also gives the defensive player an opportunity to make a good play you dont have to quit on something
103448 if his efforts make it so theres only one foot in then his efforts count hes rewarded for them i think thats the way the game ought to be
103449 if you looked at some of the numbers guys were sitting on as we got into the middle of june i think it was very apparent that even their average year would mean a big upswing in the second half of the year
103450 hes doing a good job he just needs to keep getting better
103451 were trying to improve some of his technique and just trying to have him be more of a physical football player
103452 even when i got picked up as a free agent i was being negative with it i was still mad
103453 i dont think louis has ever been scared of a challenge
103454 he works hard its not surprising not one bit hes doing well i expect him to continue to step up to the challenge
103455 you just could see the difference with velocity that hes just not letting it go which is fine
103456 hes such an explosive player that its something we have to look at
103457 weve had a lot of changes but i think the new team will be a lot of fun
103458 we have so much talent and everybody is so young
103459 with the contract comes bigger responsibilities and you are expected to do more
103460 i knew we had a really great relationship with the warriors so i thought sooner or later we would get the deal done
103461 of course there was a little bit of stress because other guys were signing and i still didnt have a contract
103462 i told my agent that i wanted to see all of the opportunities but my first priority was the warriors
103463 makes it so much fun to play basketball and the warriors have really taken care of me for the last four years
103464 im trying to get a little jump shot and more and more offensive moves
103465 we need x ramirez does x well so well look past y and z
103466 you knew the job was dangerous when you took it fred
103467 i dont like to see the game get stopped because of something like that
103468 i cant control it what am i going to do but my reaction out there led to something and i dont like it i felt bad
103469 we can only assume your ill timed and poorly conceived pursuit of republic is designed to disrupt what you perceive as a competitive threat to your position in the market
103470 an acquisition of republic will most certainly burden the company with excessive debt distract your management result in significant regulatory burdens and thereby reduce shareholder value
103471 we encourage you to act with the best interests of your shareholders in mind in a responsible and prudent manner and to abandon this acquisition
103472 we have asked to meet with the head of bgi to discuss with him why we believe this to be the case and hope to be given that opportunity soon
103473 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
103474 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
103475 based on surveys of 120 000 students average 325 per campus at the 368 schools in the book during the 2007 08 and or previous two school years ninety five percent were completed online at http survey review com
103476 combining the tools of genomics virology and evolutionary biology he and his colleagues took a virus that had been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years figured out how the broken parts were originally aligned and then pieced them together after resurrecting the virus the team placed it in human cells and found that their creation did indeed insert itself into the dna of those cells they also mixed the virus with cells taken from hamsters and cats it quickly infected them all offering the first evidence that the broken parts could once again be made infectious the experiment could provide vital clues about how viruses like h i v work inevitably though it also conjures images of frankensteins monster and jurassic park
103477 this is something not to fear but to celebrate heidmann told specter one day as they sat in his office at the institute which is dedicated to the treatment and eradication of cancer
103478 these viruses made those changes possible it is quite possible that without them human beings would still be laying eggs
103479 the columbian exchange that took place around 1492 changed the western way of conceiving the globe it forcefully challenged its theology it allowed for a free flow of bacteria germs and microbes that almost wiped out the american peoples
103480 i make a lot of money these days speaking to corporations so id really prefer not to admit how
103481 stop looking at a manual and look at the people
103482 the market is in the process of bottom formation and thats why the volatility is very high and every bit of negative news is being used to sell
103483 i dont see a clear trend emerging in the market before the next two to four weeks
103484 to work together to help realise new zealands digital potential
103485 the conduct of federal programs or other programs or operations essential to the interests of our nation
103486 increased information sharing will benefit the department congress and the public as well as the private sector which controls the vast majority of the nations cyber infrastructure
103487 it is my hope that the release of this information will assist in improving security in both the public and private sectors
103488 protection of federal networks and the security of our homeland
103489 prior to this announcement committee staff had been instructed that the existence of the ncsc was itself classified
103490 multi agency multi year plan to secure the federal governments cyber networks
103491 coordinate and integrate information necessary to help secure u s cyber networks and systems and help foster collaboration among federal cyber groups
103492 single location for all source situational awareness about cyber activity and security status of the u s networks and systems
103493 why was the determination made that the contract will be for a 10 month period
103494 how will the dhs provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the contractors support efforts do not intrude on inherently governmental functions
103495 technological upgrades and planning activities are classified dhs will be happy to provide the committee with a briefing in the appropriate classified setting
103496 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
103497 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
103498 only three events watergate the iran hostage crisis and the economic downturn of 1992 have driven below 30 percent the number who think things are going well
103499 american drivers are counting on congress to lift the ban and so are american workers
103500 the low approval rating for democratic leaders in congress is not likely to put the partys control of congress in jeopardy
103501 there is no indication in any poll taken by any organization that voters want to see the gop regain control of congress and all generic ballot questions show a wide lead for democratic congressional candidates
103502 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
103503 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
103504 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
103505 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
103506 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
103507 the scientific community is really going to run with this
103508 just after it was born this neutron star got a one way ticket out of the galaxy
103509 astronomers have seen other stars being flung out of the milky way but few as fast as this
103510 there are altogether 15 tons of helium 3 on earth while on the moon the total amount of helium 3 can reach one to five million tons
103511 helium 3 is considered as a long term stable safe clean and cheap material for human beings to get nuclear energy through controllable nuclear fusion experiments
103512 if we human beings can finally use such energy material to generate electricity then china might need 10 tons of helium 3 every year and in the world about 100 tons of helium 3 will be needed every year
103513 we will have cameras on the lander cameras on the vehicle and even on the shoulder helmet or belly of the astronaut
103514 they were so close but they had to turn back for safetys sake
103515 according to our mars work during landing you might get descent pictures that give you gradually a higher resolution of the places on the surface
103516 when they land they kind of lose the sense of orientation size and shape of objects
103517 we love defense as a team because we have a lot of guys who can get at it defensively cause some havoc and make a lot of plays
103518 were not quite the boston braves but we havent been down this far in a while
103519 but its like anything else you take your small victories and your big victories life is full of mostly small victories
103520 i saw the first seafair race in 1950 when he would have been almost 2 years old but i dont remember it
103521 its a real change of pace from what i do otherwise
103522 not a lot of competition for that though is there
103523 i have no problems running against ken driving wise hes got guts no doubt about that but hes never really had a number one part boat to go play with
103524 now i can say it that i was in congestive heart failure during the race
103525 i had to take my air mask off because i had trouble breathing
103526 i do it because i like it and i can
103527 the first day when he came here he said dont anyone ever call me crash and so i always call him crash
103528 hes like i just told all the guys not to call me crash and im like yeah but im your wife i can call you crash we have a very sarcastic relationship
103529 here comes this idiot again is this guy crazy or what whats he got for us this time
103530 hell arrive at chavez ravine just as soon as the dodgers can find their traveling secretary
103531 friends over there tell me that the air in china looks like the air in willie nelsons tour bus
103532 its like an orchestra everyone plays a different instrument and at some point you will have a solo
103533 it has now been viewed over 6 million times directly at youtube being an anthropologist he jokes that this is kind of a big deal the usual magic number for the tenure folder is 200 people seeing your work his second video
103534 its always a tough decision when you leave an organization like detroit
103535 they understand the situation is an opportunity to come to chicago to be with stan
103536 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
103537 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
103538 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
103539 but when the general public sees a bat flopping around on the ground in the daytime theres usually something wrong with it
103540 i noticed something flittering around on the ground and i looked and it was a bat
103541 were not trying to panic the public or give a negative perception of bats theyre a natural part of the ecosystem
103542 just come and get them out of here i dont care how
103543 i dont want them in my house but i dont want to hurt them
103544 hes got a long way to go lots of surgery hell need prosthesis
103545 it was a miracle that the boy resurfaced and it was the miracle of all miracles that the gator did not come back a second time as the boy lay in the water
103546 this was a very large gator and as they get bigger they can become more aggressive
103547 its too bad someone didnt contact us to get it out of there
103548 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisers in this or any other context
103549 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
103550 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
103551 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
103552 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
103553 if one product is selling well at store a but selling badly at store b rfid powered inventory systems could initiate the transfer of the product from one store to another
103554 you give us 90 seconds well give you a lottery ticket
103555 i did not expect the acceleration that were seeing in the out years
103556 whether were talking about logs generated by network or application firewalls intrusion detection systems file integrity monitor tools or the operating systems themselves ive come to the conclusion that the only people who dont hate them are the vendors who sell them
103557 due to overwhelming interest in card rewards we are currently experiencing difficulty accessing starbucks card accounts we are working to fix the problem and ask that you please try again later
103558 i was kept in an unknown place my rights were not told to me i had no right to telephone or even to a text message
103559 being detained in guant namo bay is undoubtedly an unpleasant highly regimented experience with instant rewards or loss of privileges for infractions
103560 gli studiosi delluniversit della california a irvine e di m nster in germania si sono concentrati sulle funzioni di una proteina chiamata neuropeptide s scoprendo che coinvolta nella cancellazione dei ricordi stressanti grazie allinflusso su alcuni neuroni che ne immagazzinano le immagini nellamigdala
103561 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
103562 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
103563 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
103564 there is a risk that the current economic and market turbulence could continue for a significant period of time and a risk of further uncertainty and contagion impacting the valuation of alliance amp leicester
103565 against this background the proposal from santander provides both greater stability and greater certainty in uncertain times
103566 we took into consideration the ethical problems that caused him to be fired as professor and the fact that he was indicted on charges of illegally trading in human eggs
103567 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system

103570 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
103571 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
103572 i honestly do not recall if follow up swabs were taken of the area
103573 i may have done so but i do not now remember reswabbing
103574 if theres contamination you always reswab and you would remember doing it
103575 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
103576 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
103577 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
103578 the weapon was pointed at me if it had not been for the window frame it wouldve hit me in the head
103579 the next moment there was a bang in the office next to the living room
103580 i grabbed the garden fork and tried to stop them the robbers from getting into the house through the broken window i had to use my garden fork as a weapon against a man with a firearm
103581 i knew if they came into the house we were dead
103582 its terrible to say you are lucky to be alive after something like this but we are lucky not to be dead
103583 with the legislative amendments the average road user will from tomorrow friday be in a much better position
103584 but from tomorrow friday the amendment act will remove the inequitable provisions to ensure that all road users are able to claim for their loss of income and medical treatment
103585 the normal rules of the award of costs following the unsuccessful party will apply
103586 those folks will be able to walk into an ice office and say im here and i want to go home
103587 illegals are responding to changing conditions in the united states and are going home in significant numbers
103588 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
103589 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
103590 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
103591 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
103592 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
103593 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
103594 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
103595 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
103596 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
103597 weve got a group of blokes there that are very excited about whats ahead of them and looking to make the most of it
103598 to win a tri nations match it doesnt matter where it is its significant and weve got one coming up and were looking forward to it
103599 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
103600 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
103601 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter
103602 we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
103603 we are well prepared since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions
103604 we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
103605 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control
103606 we have ordered six new boeing 777 300er aircraft for delivery beginning in 2010 they are 23 per cent more fuel efficient than the boeing 747 400 and give us additional flexibility in the long haul fleet
103607 im pleased to say that talks towards a merger with spanish carrier iberia are under way this is good news for both airlines our shareholders and our customers
103608 the potential benefits are significant we can build on our successful 10 year relationship with increased efficiencies synergies and an excellent network fit
103609 it will be several months before talks are finalised but we are confident of securing regulatory approval
103610 our talks with american airlines and iberia towards further co operation are progressing well
103611 despite the difficult situation the industry is in we remain absolutely focused on the interests of our customers
103612 price increases are being implemented to reflect fuel cost rises but will have an impact on volumes
103613 the main driver behind fare increases will be the high oil price its very clear that the industry is going to have reflect this high price
103614 people must not be misled by his fight record and think that he will be easy meet for fana
103615 mexicans all have misleading record but we all saw what happened to mashaba when he fought cruz who came to the fight with 11 losses yet gave him a spanking
103616 are you feeling okay this is the second night in a row youve gone to bed early
103617 like any little girl growing up in a squatter camp i was a child with only dreams i never thought they would come true
103618 it is a dream that has come true i can now be an inspiration to other girls who think things cant happen for them too
103619 there is a risk that the current economic and market turbulence could continue for a significant period of time and a risk of further uncertainty and contagion impacting the valuation of alliance amp leicester
103620 against this background the proposal from santander provides both greater stability and greater certainty in uncertain times
103621 you have to be very careful with talk of a windfall tax we already pay tax at up to 75 per cent on our upstream businesses
103622 fixed or capped price plans could be a lifeline for those who are more vulnerable to price rises
103623 this really is the last chance for households to avoid the energy price rises
103624 consumers have to act within the next few days by switching to a capped tariff today we predict this could save a typical home 300 400 over the next year
103625 we saw what happened in the past when inflation got out of control and people found that every penny they got in a wage increase was swallowed up by food and fuel prices going up
103626 consider the work of god for who can make straight what he has made crooked
103627 bt has continued to grow revenue earnings ebitda and earnings per share in the first quarter
103628 our full year guidance remains unchanged we continue to expect to deliver growth in revenue ebitda earnings per share and dividends per share in this financial year
103629 wholesale has been under pressure for some time but such a big drop in one quarter is pretty dramatic
103630 the scale of fall in value is more of a market response to being surprised than a reflection of what is happening in the business
103631 unlike merrill lynch which earlier this week engaged in a massive fire sale of the bulk of its remaining exposure to cdos mr hornby insists hes under no particular pressure to sell hell only sell at a price which suits him in which case he may not be selling at all
103632 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
103633 you can wonder whether a slowing economy will draw down inflation by itself but the point is that we must prevent inflation expectations changing we must make clear that we are guarding against expectations rising because if they do so then they will be factored into wages and prices
103634 we are not going to go down the fast food lane and do things that are not in the long term interest of the brand and the experience
103635 good operating performance combined with increased oil and gas prices offset the impact of weaker downstream conditions in the second quarter
103636 i dont see why it will help consumers in the long term
103637 and leaves the group broadly on track to make our forecast 3 8bn buy back for the full year
103638 dont waste your time on speculating and wait until the announcement
103639 it is about us being very very tough and saying there are parts of our operations we will allow to run down
103640 i would be very very relaxed if the corporate balance sheet was static or declined
103641 you dont talk about selling assets when you are raising 4bn of capital i suspect that they will be open to decent offers for australia
103642 they are getting more realistic about the economy like lloyds the key thing is how bad is it if we avoid a recession theyre fine if we dont theyre not
103643 im not here to predict whether companies get bid for or not
103644 the really interesting result were seeing across multiple studies is that these thin models make women feel bad but they like it
103645 they have higher evaluation of the brands with the more regular size models they dont feel bad their body image doesnt change but in terms of evaluations of the brands those are actually lower
103646 attempting to climb everest is an intrinsically irrational act any person who would seriously consider it is almost by definition beyond the sway of reasoned argument
103647 na na na na na na you cant catch me
103648 so its just us now what are we supposed to do

103650 hey i did my best to talk him out of it he wouldnt listen
103651 what i find totally totally disgusting is its been two years since the process was in place it took nine months for three judges to reject an appeal
103652 i dont think there are too many rhodes scholars there
103653 the proof can be described as overwhelming which leads me to conclude there is no reasonable possibility the verdict could have been different

103668 the decline in the ranking of all u s cities is due to the weakening value of the u s dollar against most major world currencies
103669 the dollar has been declining steadily for the past several years which has resulted in an overall decrease in the cost of living in 19 u s cities relative to other major global cities studied
103670 companies may assign high priority to expansion in these economies but may have to deal with inflationary pressures due to competition for expatriate level housing
103671 the u s dollars loss of value may serve to attract globally mobile executives to business centers such as new york chicago and los angeles
103672 the difference in cost of living can be significant particularly for those executives with families
103673 we will start the campaign programme this weekend anwar is heading to penang to launch it
103674 nothing is going to stop anwars return to politics unless the ruling government cheats with the use of phantom voters and vote buying
103675 i think they may act against him but we hope the authorities will act in a fair and just manner
103676 we have to be realistic it will be tough we will do our best
103677 il tait important de faire un signe politique fort loccasion de ces jeux olympiques dautant plus que les chinois nont respect aucun des engagements mais vraiment aucun quils ont pris lorsque la d cision a t prise que les jeux olympiques auraient lieu p kin
103678 les repr sentants des pays d mocratiques devraient refuser de jouer le jeu dun parti communiste chinois qui narr te pas dinterpeller qui narr te pas de condamner mort qui narr te pas de censurer tout le monde de ne pas laisser les journalistes faire leur travail en chine
103679 il sagit de savoir si on veut se mettre genoux devant le pouvoir politique actuel au pouvoir en chine l est la question

103689 it was very frustrating because i didnt know how it was going to pull up i was in pain through the whole match
103690 the pain wasnt so sharp but i couldnt hold my racquet on my forehand
103691 i tried to fight as much as i could i really wanted to win this match but obviously shes a very good player she figured it out
103692 the first thing i was thinking was well girl you made it
103693 the second thing was that it was the first top 10 player ive beaten ive had a lot of chances before and played some great matches but never did that it was also the first night match i won in my career
103694 so there were a lot of first times today i dont know how but i managed it
103695 doctors informed us that mister ieng sary was taken to the hospital this morning because he had blood in his urine
103696 if possible i want to reduce the fuel price right now be patient the government will announce it later
103697 the government is studying several matters before making the announcement
103698 i think if the trend of oil prices continues downwards it is only right that it is reflected in domestic prices there is a desire for us to reflect the current market situation
103699 if oil prices remain between us 120 a barrel and us 125 a barrel for two weeks
103700 a keen vision of a strong athletic program grounded in both character and skills development for our students
103701 we dont get to throw the ball much in real football so its pretty good to come out here and throw the football around a little bit
103702 weve always tried to do what were good at and right now were good at running and catching
103703 were going to run the football thats our main deal
103704 this program should be abolished its turned out to be a colossal waste of taxpayer money
103705 but the lieutenant governor believes its prudent to receive the results of this next round of tests before making any final determination about the need for continued funding
103706 i think being in a small school definitely benefitted me because i could play everything and i didnt have to stick to one sport
103707 when you think you have something and you lose it at the last second it really got my motivation going for track
103708 i was hoping but i didnt really expect it to happen
103709 i pushed this important legislation through the legislature because i knew it would deter our young people from wrecking their bodies and putting their lives at risk by using illegal steroids
103710 this is one of those issues that sounds good but has no real impact except wasting taxpayer dollars
103711 i dont want to diminish the seriousness of steroids but you cant take a sledgehammer to kill a gnat
103712 i think kids know that its dangerous and it aint worth whatever gains you might get from it for a year or two
103713 if we come back and you have just another two positive tests then i think it would be realistic to scaling it back some
103714 i dont think anyone would have a problem with that because you still have the deterrent factor out there because its a random test
103715 houston is the heart of texas football country and were proud to welcome the states best football players to reliant stadium
103716 for cross country my season was pretty good i didnt end it the way i wanted to but on the whole it was good

103721 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority
103722 our main reason for doing this is were trying to cut down on the black population
103723 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways
103724 he told the police he had nothing to do with this
103725 your children got no business going to the street for love theres no love out there
103726 all thats out there is lost young men looking for love
103727 there was no weapon present and no danger to the public
103728 it was preparing to turn and it appears the wheels got off the edge of the roadway

103753 at the moment there are a great many people with hepatitis c who have no treatment options left and it would transform their lives if we could prevent them from developing liver failure we are looking forward to seeing the results of our upcoming trial in humans now that weve had such promising results in the trial in mice
103754 if we have positive results from the new trial we will have a potential treatment that is already available and very cheap and which should be safe enough for people to take
103755 if we are successful in hepatitis c patients we are hopeful that such treatment might benefit people with liver damage from other causes and this is something we would be keen to study further
103756 a 3g apple iphone is guaranteed to happen in the next three months
103757 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
103758 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
103759 we are well prepared since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
103760 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control we have ordered six new boeing 777 300er aircraft for delivery beginning in 2010 they are 23 more fuel efficient than the boeing 747 400 and give us additional flexibility in the long haul fleet
103761 im pleased to say that talks towards a merger with spanish carrier iberia are under way this is good news for both airlines our shareholders and our customers
103762 ben haim is a good experienced premier league defender who maybe has a point to prove he feels he did not get enough games at chelsea and is looking to be involved a lot more here he will not be the only new arrival we are looking for good players in several positions and are working on a few deals
103763 they defended extremely well it was damage limitation from them really but you have to give them praise for their efforts
103764 their goalkeeper had a wonderful night they threw bodies in the way of everything and made life very difficult for us
103765 i was pleased with my lads they kept at them and if their goalkeeper had not had such a great night we would have won it at a canter
103766 i didnt hit the sweet spot for a couple of races although at the last few races the car has been the best it has ever been
103767 it should be that way weve been working very hard to develop it and weve seen the evolution of the car for me personally to rediscover that sweet spot ive spent a lot more time with my engineer analysing things and trying to work out where we have gone wrong on weekends
103768 what weve done at recent tests at hockenheim silverstone and jerez weve really extracted the most from them that is all due to reliability making good parts and with all that weve made some good steps forward
103769 i didnt know that but its of no importance to me at all to be honest
103770 i would just like to continue with the momentum i have to score more points this weekend
103771 if we have the car to win then we will go for that otherwise it would be nice to just be on the podium before the break
103772 if im honest its taken a while but its nice to get past 200 but i should have done it 15 or 20 tests ago
103773 but i want to take a lot more than that for the team and i want to perform better than i have before and i want to keep improving
103774 at this time statistics dont mean that much to me maybe when im older ill sit down and look at them
103775 when youre bowling against one of the best players in the world like kallis it brings the best out of me it was up there with one of my better spells
103776 vmware esxi delivers dramatically quicker and easier installation of virtual appliances this enables our customers to deploy altor s virtual network analysis and security solutions even faster giving them instant visibility into their virtual network activity said amir ben efraim chief executive officer of altor networks with vmware esxi accelerating the pace of virtual appliance deployments in the datacenter the demand for virtual network firewalls also accelerates we are excited to be a vmware partner and support vmware esxi across our products simplifying the delivery and deployment of catbird s v agent virtual appliance via the open virtualization format ovf and vmware esxi is a terrific component of our goal of ensuring catbird customers have instant easy to use protection and compliance for their virtual environments

103781 the international olympic committee and the organizing committee of the beijing olympic games should fulfil their commitment to full media freedom and provide immediate uncensored internet access at olympic media venues censorship of the internet at the games is compromising fundamental human rights and betraying the olympic values
103782 i regret that it now appears bocog has announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
103783 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
103784 tu prends une photo et a lenvoi au reste du monde avec ton nom la date lheure et ta position exacte sur google maps m me moi jy crois pas
103785 i spent the weekend with about a dozen people i met many months ago on seesmic i have gotten to know these people online as well as i would have if i met them in person when we departed early monday morning i cried and cried and cried and cried when my co workers asked me on tuesday morning how my weekend was i had to choke back tears and tell them i wasnt ready to talk about it
103786 we do not believe that the district courts action infringes on petitioners right to free speech
103787 it would be wicked to give it zero because it does show some very basic skills we are looking for like conveying some meaning and some spelling

103791 africa has a bright future if it can be helped to trade its way out of poverty
103792 but the west individuals and organisations is still making mistakes
103793 working for concern universal has taught me the importance of preparing communities to receive aid
103794 when they help sink a well for example they get that community to buy into the project by preparing them for six months beforehand with education and training this means villagers feel they own the project and will look after it when the donor has gone away
103795 the disused pumps for example i have spoken to individuals here who in a very good natured way have seen a community in need and rushed out and written a cheque and drilled a borehole in the ground
103796 then its fallen into disuse either because no one knew how to repair it or it was in the wrong place and was causing disputes in the village or a dozen different reasons because there was no fundamental ownership
103797 i still hear people talking about how many drugs theyve delivered how many injections theyve given thats not what you want to be measuring
103798 if african farmers can be helped to take advantage of simple techniques to boost food production their income will rise significantly relieving poverty especially in rural areas
103799 well tell you what you need to know when you need to know it and youll like it
103800 apple takes security seriously but we dont comment about unreleased products
103801 one of the ideas behind it is to give a reality to violence
103802 one of the things that happens through television particularly is that we view violence in a very abstract way as something that doesnt really involve pain and suffering and fear
103803 creating this experience in this venue gives us the opportunity to explore violence and allows the audience to experience violence in their face
103804 the pornography of the title is a metaphor the play is about the culture in which the 7 7 bombings took place
103805 its an attempt to dramatise the idea that the boys who attacked london on that day were rather than being alien or being monstrous or being separate from the england which they were born and raised in were actually a product of that england

103807 there could be a few things about which i could take issue with zimbabwean president robert mugabe but his unflinching and unapologetic stance over homosexuals is definitely not among those
103808 i stand by my column whatever happened to freedom of speech in this country
103809 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
103810 wo wir im moment stehen ist noch immer das resultat der fehlenden investitionen aus dem letzten jahr

103818 ammetto che quando fini mi volle vicepresidente della camera due anni fa alla mia prima legislatura fu un bellimpatto per tutti per me ma anche per tanti colleghi di an che si sono visti scavalcare da una giovanissima senza esperienza
103819 lusingata ma il mio nome gira spesso su tutte le ruote pi per posizionamenti interni che per altro
103820 guardi lo schema un po diverso fini divenne leader del movimento giovanile su indicazione di almirante io sono stata eletta dopo aver vinto un congresso per pochi voti a me nessuno ha regalato niente
103821 ho naturalmente un ottimo rapporto con il presidente fini che mi ha dato questaltra opportunit ma credo di non aver sfigurato nel lavoro alla camera e ho molte idee per il mio ministero
103822 rivoluzione del merito contro il modello egualitarista ereditato dal sessantotto le intelligenze esistono e vanno valorizzate

103824 in questo caso voglio raccontare storie edificanti dei nostri ragazzi non ci sono solo gli episodi di bullismo ma milioni di storie di impegno civile sociale religioso vorrei diffonderle in televisione e nei siti internet non bisogna mostrare solo gli aspetti degenerativi
103825 conosco le obiezioni ma sono convinta che se i giovani si vedono rappresentati sempre al peggio si convincono di esserlo voglio invece che non si considerarsi peggiori dei loro padri perch cos non se un tempo ci fossero stati telefonini e youtube non avremmo visto scene molto diverse e poi sulla comunicazione penso una cosa precisa
103826 se ieri erano rivoluzionarie le idee oggi rivoluzionario il modo in cui le idee vengono comunicate e comunicano tra di loro
103827 the thing is i hate drunk drivers living in la i cant stand them and thats why i was so disappointed in myself i wanted to prove to the court that i would take it completely seriously so i went to rehab to prove i was sober
103828 it really helped in getting the more serious aspects of my case dropped because you know thats what they want to hear youre not an alcoholic and you dont have a problem
103829 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1

103838 the biggest difference between dark knight and batman begins is batman was entirely shot without anamorphic lenses its all made in cinemascope the majority of dark knight was shot in cinemascope but a substantial proportion of it originated in imax format and we did all the post production in imax resolution a major r amp d effort
103839 we used our panoramic photographic process but also did a lot of digital architecture because there wasnt any one landscape we could use in chicago to actually place in these different views so there is an awful lot of green screen compositing and very careful keying that had to be done all at imax resolution
103840 wed done digital batmen digital stunt doubles for batman begins but never had to do anything seen this close up under this degree of scrutiny
103841 the guys really rose to the challenge the hand over between the practical and the digital batmobile is absolutely seamless the only thing people will perhaps find as a giveaway is how would you actually get all that to work but hopefully weve given it enough mechanical reality that it pulls all together
103842 this is a good example where chris would say we dont have anything here what are you going to do for me this usually happens when we have about four weeks before delivery so we are well into the post period the film has all been cut together then you are looking and see there is a big black hole there and chris says yes we need a shot of the batmobile doing this well what about a background plate oh there is no background plate you have to make the environment as well so we not only had to do the batmobile and batpod and batman but the entire environment that the batpod drives out into but because we spent all this time putting the pipeline to get the assets in place and fully documented all the locations and sets we could do this
103843 as ever chris wanted to do this practically if he could but obviously there are limits and though chicago was very happy to let us do all sorts of crazy things in the street they werent that keen on us crashing a helicopter into a building
103844 one of the 10 scout laws is a scout cares for the environment
103845 solar panels have been sparingly used in the past by some troops but telstras donation will boost their use through the scouting movement
103846 solar power is a better choice for the environment its also cheaper and much safer
103847 telstra is australias biggest user of solar energy and this donation has been made possible due to upgrades in telstras infrastructure nationally
103848 we chose scouts australia because we feel their approach of helping young people become wise stewards of the environment through their many projects is to be applauded and supported

103856 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease

103870 that accumulates to a lot more than im probably going to win but thats a good way to put yourself in it and have a goal and try to reach it
103871 its incredibly tough because its the biggest names from kentucky and new york and everything the fact that i had a very successful belmont meet has helped me get on some decent horses for saratoga the toughest part is because its my first year here you have to prove yourself its like starting over on a new page this is where you make a name for yourself
103872 the teacher would say what do you want to be
103873 they were like what do you mean jockey its so funny that i was the one who had that dream that actually came true
103874 financially it looked like it could be a good move for me i said if i can suck up the cold weather it might be better for the future test it out one year and see what happened
103875 that day nobody really knew who little belle was and nobody really knew who rajiv maragh was in kentucky
103876 it was amazing because at that time the talk about the keeneland polytrack was that you cant go wire to wire
103877 i think a strength that i have is putting a lot of extra effort into paying attention to stuff that doesnt concern only me
103878 i can remember a horse that ran two weeks ago that i didnt even ride in the race i remember it exactly i have a good horse memory i cant remember anything else in my life i cant remember to take out the garbage but i remember every horse
103879 i think rite moment is coming into this race much better than she came into the last one
103880 i had a lot of lapses in training before her last race it was one thing after another
103881 she had a nasty cold cough track conditions we had some rain it just seemed like nothing went right for her between races this time between races everything is going right so i really feel much more confident in her now i think im presenting a better horse this time and she still finished third
103882 we breezed her one day three quarters and theres some idiot galloping a horse on the rail and as she comes up to him he goes out she goes out she has to check its like her whole training schedule was just totally disrupted for three or four different reasons and she ran very well anyway
103883 at the time i was really incensed at coa but you know something thats what coa does he doesnt do it to just me he does it to everybody
103884 thats race riding because when he does it for me i dont mind
103885 actually the strongest part of my game is the way i control myself on the golf course i dont let anything get to me
103886 being calm is a natural part of my personality my mom always wonders where i got it from i dont have a temper or anything thats the way ive always been
103887 the last two years ive stayed strong with the putter but earlier this year i kind of struggled a little with it usually though its the strongest part of my game
103888 i usually pick a line first and even if its downhill i never think too much about the speed ive been told that the ones i make sometimes are moving pretty good at the hole but when i roll the ball i feel like im doing it at the perfect speed for me
103889 i just step right up and putt the ball i dont take a practice stroke i may take a couple of practice swings behind the ball when im looking at the line but when im ready to go i just step up and hit it
103890 that was a lot of fun but the proudest moment of my career so far was qualifying for the usga juniors last year
103891 i didnt play too well out there but i was playing with the top juniors in the world and it was a real thrill
103892 i never played golf until i started high school going from eighth grade to my freshman year in high school is when i really took up the game i got on the varsity team as a freshman
103893 in the last few weeks since i played in the state am i havent had a migraine since
103894 at devils bowl where we have been racing weekly on sunday i have had two top five finishes and three top 10 finishes in six events
103895 we have been pretty successful up at devils bowl and i thought that we were on the verge of getting a win there because of how we were struggling at albany saratoga i was very surprised that the win came at malta
103896 ron ran real well and i am really not surprised that he won
103897 his car was awful good tonight and it was basically his race when ron has a good car he can definitely get the job done
103898 knowing that ronnie said that makes me feel real good
103899 i have been told that by other drivers as well and it is great that the other drivers still respect me even if i dont have a big budget to race with if we can keep the equipment fresh and get a win once in awhile that proves what they all say is true that i can still get the job done
103900 this teo car was new last year and we have been trying to get it set up better for slick surfaces
103901 we were trying different things with the car but after winning three weeks ago we figured that we found something and we have left the car alone
103902 gary waters does all of the machine work and then i assemble the motor myself
103903 i can always count on gary and that is why i always ask him a lot of questions about motors his years of experience are irreplaceable and i like to tap into his brain about things he has definitely been a big help to me because doing things yourself you never know if you have enough but when you do get a win it feels that much better because you did do it all yourself
103904 gary told me that i am outclassed and i know that he is right
103905 we have been using the same heads on this motor for eight years and we know that we are behind where everyone else is i feel that a good motor will make up for an ill handling race car but that doesnt work with an older motor like we have so we have to have the motor and the car working together i think that i am one of a few left besides mike ronca and brett johnson that do our own motors
103906 we also have a lot of parts saved to use as needed that necessarily arent the best equipment there are two wheels that we have had to use at times that were off of a troyer car that i ran back in 1989 and they are not lightweight like the new ones that are out now the disadvantage of using older stuff shows up on the track as it makes it harder to get around all of those with the best of everything
103907 i ran for car owners more during my career than i owned my own equipment
103908 i owned my own stuff until 1989 when i got together with george beyer in the late 1990s george introduced me to ron white who i drove for until this past winter when he transferred the ownership of the number 27 that i drive at malta and devils bowl to debbie eddy she decided to take over ownership of the race car to promote her new business vermontblanketgram com which will be on the side of the car within the next couple of weeks
103909 everything was big blocks back then but when c j went to small blocks that was a big savings for all of us
103910 but the costs always escalate and the teams with money will still find a way to spend it and now we are running full blown 358s again
103911 everyone is tightening their belts and sponsorship is so hard to come by because everything is so expensive i think that going to a spec motor is going to come sooner or later and i favor it but we all have all of this equipment to use up now and hopefully they will figure out a way to let us use up our old stuff as well
103912 running on a limited budget like we do and struggling at times sometimes makes me wonder why i am still doing it
103913 as long as i am competitive i still have the desire to race and even without top notch equipment as long as we are in the hunt it will keep me going it also helps to have all of your family around you that gets you through the tough times as well
103914 we hate to make these increases because we know times are tough for everyone
103915 we held the line for as long as we could but price increases are also affecting us from gasoline to diesel fuel to food costs
103916 do you think theyre really going to do that for a 5 sandwich
103917 it would be perfect that would be good for me
103918 think about that if a new store comes in how can they make money
103919 slow traffic down so people can see the businesses yes
103920 erie boulevard is not a walking street anymore people drive they are not going to be able to get places
103921 the u turn is not the ultimate answer its an improvement over what we had in the plan but weve got to get rid of the roundabout
103922 i think theyre just trying to shut the bookstore down
103923 the pool at the college has been leaking and its been leaking for a couple years
103924 these are big projects with a lot of dollars attached to them and you want to be thoughtful about it
103925 the counties wanted to know just how much the pool is used and like many colleges it serves a smaller group of students than many of the other facilities
103926 our goal is to bring people from outside of schenectady into schenectady
103927 we are hoping the college wants it for office use we can provide 10 000 square feet of office space
103928 it is a logical choice the college needs space and is looking to expand and it is an ideal location
103929 he recently received an award from the heritage foundation for his work in restoring a building on lower union street that is now the home to the winedown lounge which is has been a terrific addition to downtown
103930 it is a modern element on top of a traditional building it is still in harmony with the building and it makes a bold statement
103931 it is an eccentric looking building but we will calm it down a bit
103932 he has a reputation for doing excellent work he has never done a project that wasnt a superior work or top notch he pays attention to every detail
103933 we have discussed some really important issues we are reasonably getting close to finalising this business proposal
103934 the managing director of the company will return on september 15 and hopefully we can get to sign off the deal with them
103935 their indication is they will start to recruit people and theyll be looking at initially about 1000 people they will build that up over the coming years to perhaps going up as high as 5000 over the next four to five years
103936 i cant explain the situation its strange and very unusual
103937 ive never had to hold a body in a funeral home because of a dispute with the family and cemetery
103938 right now for the third week my mothers body is sitting in marra funeral home which is really discouraging because when someone in your family dies it sounds mean you want to get it over with you want closure
103939 my main goal is to put my mother to rest
103940 the diocese is trying to say its not their fault
103941 if i have to move my whole family it will be one more time and thats it
103942 i dont have any other options they own the cemetery i am at a loss right now it feels pretty stagnant
103943 there is really nothing i can do the cemetery and family have to come to an agreement its highly unusual
103944 some of the matches were done on what areas of studies the students were doing at their home universities that were similar to programs here
103945 its my understanding that they are unable to return to their colleges or because of their home situations due to the earthquake damage
103946 universities in china are highly specialized in studies so we are working to accommodate that
103947 a period of national service in sichuan to help with the rebuilding effort
103948 suny will provide these students with valuable leadership training which will help prepare them to return to china to assist with rebuilding efforts and the aftermath of the earthquake
103949 we see this program not only as a way to grow educational cooperation and exchanges with suny but also as a critical first step in helping to expand mutually beneficial economic and commercial relations between sichuan province and new york state
103950 the suny system is mounting a campaign to raise money from private sources to cover the costs

103955 the bottom line is we not going to open a store in rotterdam
103956 i basically have an empty plaza and all the expenses i had before
103957 one thing that cannot be denied is that the plaza is in a great location
103958 there is no better place to do business in rotterdam
103959 we looked forward to having a new building in that site and now we dont know whats in store for us
103960 we want residents to feel like theyre maybe walking into a hotel
103961 the whole idea is to rehab people and get them back home
103962 the staff really seems to care so we like it here
103963 it does all the documentation for them they have more time to dedicate to the residents
103964 you want to have a document in place so you are prepared when developers come in and developers can known what to expect
103965 this is designed for the professionals the party people they know exactly what to do and expect
103966 its literally so arcane that without a lot of heavy lifting you can knock off what i call a legitimate signature
103967 the law requires that they be knocked off the ballot
103968 i certainly wish that we had had more signatures but we are confident that we have the required number
103969 thanks to a the one time excel program offered by the state the district was able to make many important safety improvements as well as address other critical repairs at no cost to local property taxpayers
103970 knowing that these opportunities are rare in public education we made
103971 we pay them we have a right to know what we pay them
103972 seethroughny is a powerful new tool that new yorkers can use to hold their elected leaders accountable for the hard earned tax dollars entrusted to them every year
103973 they knew that we didnt have a lot of funding so they really worked with us
103974 we would never have gotten a gym this nice for this long without them
103975 amsterdam is lucky enough to have a lot of sports teams
103976 this is very convenient for the kids and they just love it here
103977 we want to make a more cohesive program it is so important to have a good feeder program for the high school
103978 this place is perfect for all types of athletics the previous owners had a fencing tournament here
103979 its nice to have people in the building and hopefully theyll come back
103980 je ne continuerai pas me battre pour juste esp rer entrer dans le q 3

103989 we know archimedes did mechanical astronomy here 100 years earlier and this could be from his home city it could have been inspired by his work or it could have been a local tradition that he started
103990 there must have been an unbroken tradition of craftsmen doing this kind of work but they didnt write it down in books for the most part they were teaching through workshops and appreticeships so were not going to get much other evidence
103991 the machine as a whole was not just showing high science showing astronomy but was linking science to the cultural cycles of the greeks
103992 we were thrilled to be part of the travel channels filming
103993 it was an honor to be chosen to represent the truckstop industry and exciting that so many will be able to learn about iowa 80
103994 when we decided to move forward with drivertech as a mobile comm replacement
103995 in cab scanning was one of the applications that we identified as a revolutionary tool that would benefit our drivers as well as our customers

104000 it is astonishing that the administration continues to back a proposal that would have such detrimental effects on drivers highway based businesses and local communities
104001 it will merely shift the point of sale away from americas rural communities where businesses have been established over the last 50 years to the one new entity able to achieve market dominance overnight by virtue of their convenient location on the shoulder of the highway
104002 unfair advantage to the businesses located directly on the interstate over those that are located at an exit off the interstate
104003 truckstops and travel plazas provide 90 percent of this nations truck parking there is no doubt that we will see a severe truck parking shortage if these businesses are forced to close their doors
104004 tolls represent a system of double taxation for the commercial trucking industry which already pays 40 percent of all highway user fees
104005 by the year 2010 small business owners who provide services to highway users along the interstate are expected to employ over two million americans and generate nearly 200 billion in sales annually we want to ensure the interests of business owners along the highways are taken into consideration
104006 serving markets in canada is our first step in offering our products to a broader customer base
104007 turned in commendable results despite a challenging business environment and the inflationary effect of unprecedented fuel prices
104008 rebecca was a part of my family for seven years
104009 we went to church weddings funerals and everything in between together it is just not in me to say disrespectful things about her
104010 i hope this gets people to look into the allegations
104011 they might still decide to vote for chris but this will be a way to make it more fair
104012 this is a direct attack from the other two democrats in this race
104013 its politics at its worst and hypocrisy at its highest level

104021 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
104022 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
104023 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

104026 in some cases even though we made progress it looks like we didnt do well
104027 at jefferson were holding steady and every once in a while we take a step back the teachers are so dedicated i know well be able to make a change next year
104028 having some new administration in the building a clear instructional focus and two math coaches made all the difference
104029 some areas with our subgroups we need to work on
104030 targets did go up this year when you move to that 51 percent that was quite a jump
104031 i think well still struggle to motivate high schoolers to want to do well on the test when all theyre really concerned about is the act but with the advisories were instituting with the opportunity for tutoring and small groups i think that will really help us
104032 we really want to get the word out that you too can help
104033 if we dont step in now to save it there wont be anything to save
104034 she was famous in town people knew her as becky thatcher
104035 we know there are so many people out there who love mark twain love his work
104036 theyre a way to tell the story of an artist who is still talking to us today
104037 when you order grounding of planes and people are making significant driving changes in the u s because the price of food and gasoline has doubled thats very bearish for oil prices moving forward
104038 people looked at yesterdays frenzied rally and realized the fundamentals werent there to support it
104039 were seeing a lower volume trade because this bull market seems to be over at least for the time being
104040 even when those factories reopen i think weve crossed a threshold where the speculative money isnt coming back into the oil market for the rest of 2008
104041 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
104042 theres better ways of doing things than just creating a hell of a mess
104043 out of your back door and you look and what used to be lush green trees and hillside and the first thing you see every morning is a 200 foot mud mountain with nothing planted on it
104044 im still not sure why the runoffs still going on larrys land
104045 we do rely on people like yourselves to let us know when theres a problem
104046 when i say were going to go out to run 5 miles the kids cant complain
104047 if they try to complain i can only say hey look what i did
104048 i ran a marathon when i was 16 and back then it was a pretty big deal
104049 since then it seems like anybody can run a marathon there are t shirts that say i run ultras because oprah killed the marathons some friends of mine and i just thought we need to try an ultra that is a big deal now
104050 forty four miles is the farthest ive went so far
104051 so this will be over twice as far as ive ever ran at one time im not really nervous i know its going to be difficult when you look at nationwide averages about 48 percent of the people who enter actually finish all you can do is take it one aid station at a time and do your best
104052 the main reason why we picked that run was to kind of get a feel of being up all day and the running overnight
104053 really the actual tired part of it like getting sleepy tired wasnt really a problem at all we all did fine as far as that part
104054 whats nice about it is that you can break it into short races so instead of thinking about running 100 miles you can think about ive got to run 4 miles to the next aid station or 5 miles to the next aid station
104055 the first marathon i ran that was kind of the approach you run from aid station to aid station and you dont think about the overall distance
104056 you dont want to sit down unless youre changing shoes or something because thats when youre really tempted to stop
104057 ive read be aware of the chair because if you get down its hard to get back up so i dont plan on resting any
104058 ill be running whenever the sun comes up and ill still be going whenever the sun goes back down
104059 that will probably be the biggest mental challenge at that point is once i go back into the nighttime hopefully ill be finished before or close to when the sun comes back up
104060 im going to be doing a little bit of the unknown and pushing my body to its limits im excited but nervous at the same time
104061 i suspect its not going to be real easy to sleep the night before
104062 i imagine its going to be like 40 hours without sleeping
104063 should allow ample time for a decision before the general election
104064 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
104065 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
104066 why the senator would like to have this matter commenced and concluded before the elections and by all indications that is possible
104067 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
104068 some said the rebates would not have an impact well they were wrong
104069 the stimulus checks are having an impact in spite of the energy prices
104070 provides one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economic picture
104071 it was very useful especially when you look at areas like getting formula
104072 i believe we should never have to make these kinds of choices ever again
104073 the big question is when will states hit the bottom we dont know
104074 i will not be able to pay my rent buy food or put gas in my car to transport my children
104075 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
104076 you should expect significant proposals from governors certainly for spending cuts probably for more tax increases and certainly for more gimmicks
104077 we have the opportunity to restructure the program to make it more user friendly
104078 that is the type of stuff that should be happening
104079 what you dare challenge me on my skills tying a shoe there will pain and blood and only one shoelace will be left standing when im done bringing terror upon you
104080 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
104081 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
104082 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
104083 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
104084 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
104085 so far all we have heard is paris hilton and britney spears
104086 i have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
104087 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims but after the pressure we applied libya can finally be held accountable for these devastating events
104088 now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
104089 it will allow them the fair and just compensation that theyve been seeking in an expeditious manner
104090 allow the united states and libya to finally close the book on a contentious period in our relationship and to look to the future
104091 a critical step in our fight for justice for our loved ones
104092 any settlements by other victims should not be at the expense of those who have fought and won in the courts
104093 we accept the verdict and respect the jurys decision and now well move on to the sentencing part of the case
104094 he wont hurt no one else in the world like he did those two women
104095 three years later with no communication in between they say the project cost more than what their estimates were
104096 i dont know where the dollar figures are coming from
104097 my thoughts are before we pay a bill we ought to find out what were going to pay for
104098 roundtable discussion with first responders and workers regarding the important partnership between local communities and the attorney generals office
104099 we give them a letter then they laugh and say this is what we are going to do
104100 the supreme court has cracked the door open and what happens next is really interesting
104101 it seems to be that a court will add branches to this tree
104102 revel is mourning the loss of several of its team members
104103 the design team was heading to minnesota for a glass manufacturing meeting
104104 it lasted im guessing probably 15 20 seconds maybe slightly longer than that it was a really really loud kind of a rumbling screechy type noise
104105 maintaining access to owatonnas business community in all weather conditions is a priority
104106 it turned around very quickly leaving at 8 13 a m and required no services on the ground
104107 weve been asked not to say anything further about it at this point we dont know who survived and who didnt
104108 with all due respect to you personally i will defend myself before this institution as i would defend myself before any natural catastrophe
104109 i have not found one bone of my children yet and there he is alive
104110 today i feel there is a bit of justice in this otherwise really pitiful world
104111 its the beast i did not believe it until now
104112 happy because the world seems to be not as bad as i thought so far if it forced him to the courtroom sad because 100 000 people he killed are not watching this
104113 to negotiate an agreement with milosevic and two of karadzics henchmen that karadzic would quit as president of the serbian portion of bosnia and as head of his political party immediately and disappear from public life
104114 reluctantly signed that agreement without ever coming to the negotiations

104117 i am so thankful for the time i did get with my father
104118 if you know the problem is there you can start addressing the problem
104119 it significantly impairs your ability to stay independent which is what people want
104120 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
104121 poor balance isnt something you have to accept you can help yourself you can improve balance
104122 demand has been high weve been selling out every afternoon
104123 june apples fared real well and peaches are coming off real nice
104124 movin to the country gonna eat a lot of peaches
104125 this is a government that has come to the end of its road
104126 the right thing to do when the prime minister goes is to let the people choose who will lead them
104127 i believe we will have elections in february or march and until then olmert will be prime minister
104128 but to say its realistic i dont know i see very large obstacles in the way
104129 i was in shock i could not move i could not do anything
104130 after this we are ordering dna tests for all children whose mothers present credible indications that they were abducted and we are asking parents of those two babies in the u s to voluntarily submit dna tests of their adoptive children
104131 these people are absolutely devastated absolutely horrified over the idea that a child was stolen from a mother
104132 there is grief over the loss of the child but absolute joy that the mother has been found
104133 maybe its because they saw i was vulnerable all alone in the shoe store
104134 that photograph kept me company during those terrible 14 months
104135 so far she has not fully adapted to me she pulls my hair bites and kicks me you have no idea how hard it is when your own child rejects you
104136 she will not take toys and when you lift your hand as if to hit her she cowers and runs away
104137 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the intergovernmental panel on climate change conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution since the correctness or fallacy of that conclusion has immense implications for public policy and for the future of the biosphere we thought it appropriate to present a debate within the pages of p amp s

104139 it had absolutely nothing to do with paul ince coming in as the manager i want to make that crystal clear
104140 there was no animosity or frustration on my part when the new manager got appointed and ive not fallen out with paul chairman john williams or anyone else at the club for that matter
104141 the bottom line is this just felt right and i would have made the same decision whether mark hughes was still the manager at rovers or not
104142 this challenge just really excited me id been in one place for the last eight years and i honestly thought id be spending the rest of my career at blackburn
104143 but then this opportunity cropped up and i just felt it was something that i had to do
104144 all i can say is the whole package revoloing around the club was too good to turn down
104145 this case is a stark reminder that it is crucial to have strict procedures for isolation and lock out and tagging of machinery during repair and maintenance work
104146 this situation should have been foreseen because the auger involved regularly became blocked and needed to be cleared so safe work procedures should have been in place to minimize the risk of this type of incident
104147 many workers have been seriously injured and even killed when equipment or machinery they were working on has been accidentally activated
104148 hence the basis of any lock out and tagging system should be that nobody is able to activate machinery while someone else is working on it
104149 after this incident the company did update the isolation and lock out and tagging instructions in its general safety rules handbook but too late for the worker whose hand was seriously injured by the moving parts of the auger
104150 plagued by higher funding cost and ongoing fears of further writedowns the sector has now tumbled over 40 per cent since its 2007 november highs
104151 shares in suncorp fell 13 per cent as the company issued a profit warning the market is punishing companies that are not meeting expectations at this stage
104152 all he said was i heard about your son how good he is and told her shes doing a great job
104153 this elite collegiate band will bring a touch of pizzazz to proceedings as well as providing an early glimpse of what is likely to be one of next months star turns
104154 the supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian while on the other hand arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world as well as property the same balance would be preserved were all the world destitute of arms for all would be alike but since some will not others dare not lay them aside horrid mischief would ensue should good men be deprived of the use of them
104155 bikers ride single file make a full stop at all stop signs and red lights
104156 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
104157 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
104158 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
104159 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
104160 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
104161 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
104162 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
104163 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible

104165 all options against iran should not only be on the table but prepared
104166 the us and israel share deep concern about irans nuclear program and discussed steps to strengthen diplomatic efforts and financial measures to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability
104167 we have asked st john ambulance to meet with us next week to resolve the issue
104168 we hope they will act in the best interests of their paramedics and agree to introduce a career structure for paramedics
104169 if the negotiations fail we now have approval to take action action may include paperwork processing delay and uniform not being worn on certain shifts
104170 paramedics are also allowed to speak to the media something that is usually disallowed by st johns
104171 they the files regarding salaries were on that infamous file server computer that was taken to london
104172 what happens to our cars when they get stolen do they go to mexico they dont go to mexico all the time they get dismantled and get rebuilt into those annoying cars kids like to beef up
104173 even with the base case scenario which assumes an open pit feed grade of 3 4 g t gold integra will be operating one of the highest grade open pit mines in australia for this size operation
104174 our drilling campaign over the past twelve months has delivered a steady procession of exceptional results which is a terrific achievement for our exploration team led by greg wilson
104175 we will now progress our feasibility study programmes which we anticipate will be completed towards the end of 2008 and are on track to demonstrate the viability of a standalone central gold processing facility at salt creek with the capacity to underpin a substantial long term gold business
104176 the next few months represent a critical phase for the randalls project as the move into feasibility should provide the basis for an exciting long term development and growth strategy for the company
104177 he came in very soon after the show started im going to guess 10 minutes after the show started
104178 i did not see or hear him do anything i was sitting with my arms around my daughters very much absorbed in the show
104179 suddenly there was a very loud boom i thought it was part of the show i looked behind me and i saw a woman fall forward bleeding
104180 i saw the barrel of a shotgun i didnt see the man
104181 this is real we have to get down and we have to get out
104182 we crawled as fast as we could toward the exit
104183 i didnt know at the time if id been shot or not
104184 i only saw my daughters faces and the floor my older daughter said mommy whats happening i told her theres a man with a gun hes killing people we have to get out
104185 i went into survival mode my mind was completely clear
104186 then we heard the sirens police arrived i heard the police radios all around me
104187 stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
104188 the civil verdict will take away the means to continue in crime giving the money to arizonas citizens
104189 the whole thing is suspicious because the police department and the attorney generals office get a cut of the action
104190 when girls who had no idea what this place was came in to interview hed attempt to get them to perform sexually with him
104191 the thinking was that if he could overcome the girls resistance they would probably have sex with a stranger

104193 jiffy pay would transfer credit card payments from angels heaven to banks in las vegas which then put it into another account for lavoie
104194 it served two purposes money laundering and if a wife gets a bill for her husband with jiffy pay on it he can make up a story
104195 we are still weighing our options but id say it is likely

104199 ze stellen absurde eisen twintig jaar oud universitair opgeleid en tien jaar werkervaring om maar iets te noemen
104200 veel ervaring maar wel jong en zeker niet te veel salaris omdat we anders niet concurren met goedkope landen
104201 dit komt vooral doordat er veel gelukszoekers zijn in de ict en te weinig echte icters als je alleen al ziet wat mensen aan salaris durven te eisen dan lach je je rot
104202 hoogopgeleid prachtige ervaringen en veelal onder de dertig de kennismigratiewet stelt dan een looneis van maar 2300 euro per maand een startsalaris van een hboer ligt in nederland veelal hoger
104203 voor 2300 euro bruto hoef je niet al te veel te verwachten
104204 wij nederlanders willen gewoon een goed salaris voor geleverde diensten maar de huidige vacatures zijn voorzien van een schraal salarisplaatje
104205 i will fall out of my chair in surprise if theres an avalanche of people taking advantage of this
104206 theyre begging people to come forward to deport themselves it kind of shows that the whole system has just collapsed
104207 this is a distraction from what we really need to think about in terms of fixing our immigration system weve got a mismatch between the supply of legal immigration from our government and the demand for legal immigration from our economy and families wanting to be reunited
104208 so jimmy how do we get rid of these people
104209 i dont know jules it would be impossible to round up 12 million people even with the help of the minutemen maybe we should offer them 50 cent coupons to the dollar store to come forward and a michael chertoff collectible bobble head as a parting gift
104210 hey ive got an idea jimmy what if we ask them really nicely pretty please with a jalape o on top
104211 nothing not a thing just a promise not to be mean to them as they leave well sell it as a kinder gentler deportation brought to you by the compassionate conservative government of george bush
104212 thats brilliant jules and after all the fugitive aliens are gone well expand the program to the other 11 5 million illegal immigrants who have been waiting for a personal invitation from uncle sam to leave but i have to admit im a little worried about the fact that many of these folks have american children here and little to return to in their native countries but poverty and struggle
104213 jimmy my boy thats a problem for the next president

104217 one of the saddest realities ive had to face in the moussaoui case in particular has been the reality that my government didnt always tell me the truth
104218 asked me if i thought theyd got it right and i said yeah i think you did
104219 in the moussaoui case it was the cia that found the material and brought the matter to the attention of the department of justice
104220 but she lived with the trial for a very long time and i assume she had a pretty tight bond with that jury
104221 what this really does is call into question the integrity of the process and thats very unfortunate
104222 le persone che cercano di far diventare peggiore questo mondo non si concedono un giorno libero perch dovrei farlo io
104223 a volte bisogna rischiare delle incertezze per avere delle certezze
104224 restituisco alla vita quello che ricevo se ti avvicini con la spada rispondo di spada se vuoi piet prima mostrala tu
104225 sono il migliore in quello che faccio il problema di quando sei il migliore che c sempre qualcuno che si crede migliore di te
104226 we are not in normal situation we are in hell
104227 any attack i undertook against america or even participated or helped in i am proud about it and i am happy
104228 its a fluid and complex process and were moving forward
104229 they are going to open it to bedrock which is great
104230 we need a place to go people need to grieve
104231 like last year well lead the nation in a day of remembrance that includes a ceremony at zuccotti park and access to the lower level for family members
104232 we are working closely with the city on appropriate plans for family members to safely visit the site on 9 11
104233 were not trying to do anything to harm the environment but we need to protect our water
104234 here youre talking about kobe and jason two elderly statesmen if you will leaders competitors they truly are the leaders of this team the younger players im talking about carmelo lebron wade all of them they defer to kobe and to jason as leaders
104235 i think the thing that is special about this team is that it has been a three year commitment its not just about this year but its about what weve done in the past to get to this point
104236 we are happy to have sasha back he made great progress this year i attribute a lot of that to his work ethic we hope he will continue to work hard to develop his game and become an even better and more consistent player
104237 given the impact that this order will have on americas intelligence community and this committees responsibility to oversee intelligence activities this cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
104238 we were only shown the document after it was complete and on its way to the president for his signature
104239 weve been in a conversation with congress and the american people about the structure of the intelligence community since the fall of 2004
104240 this legislation will create a higher education system that is more affordable fairer and easier to navigate for students and families
104241 the greatest threat to higher education isnt underfunding its over regulation
104242 it needs to be done before the kids go back to school this fall
104243 i talk to senator kennedy once a week to give him a report on whos been naughty and whos been nice
104244 we have tens of thousands of people who are hurting
104245 this city is going to be rebuilt and its going to be better than ever
104246 we already have loans on the business that we took out to start it
104247 if you could see how excited they the veterans are you would know why i am doing this
104248 they make me want to cry because they are just so happy to have been given this opportunity
104249 ive heard that its very emotional that the veterans are treated like heroes every step of the way as they deserve to be
104250 were hoping to keep this up until weve sent all the veterans that want to go
104251 i knew the people of the legion would get behind us because they are very pro veteran but the whole city is behind us and weve even gotten checks from out of town
104252 were very surprised shocked even at the funds weve raised its catching on like wildfire
104253 every day medical researchers are coming up with new discoveries and theyre getting closer to developing an artificial pancreas
104254 as we continue to move one step closer to a cure together we are truly creating a brighter future for the more than 24 million children and adults afflicted with this minute by minute disease
104255 i hope the audience realizes we put this whole thing together for the glory of god
104256 hopefully those that dont know jesus christ will get to know more about him
104257 like me and she can be nice when she wants to like me
104258 he wants everyone to be active and start having fun
104259 sometimes these simple little musicals can turn on a light in these kids
104260 the globally increasing cost of raw materials other materials and supplies across the food chain continued to weaken the groups performance
104261 changes in the global meat market create uncertainty in all of atrias business areas
104262 theres no gray area get your feet in or youre out it also gives the defensive player an opportunity to make a good play you dont have to quit on something
104263 if his efforts make it so theres only one foot in then his efforts count hes rewarded for them i think thats the way the game ought to be
104264 vi er tilfredse med at google har indf rt tilstr kkelige sikringer s risikoen for brud p privatlivets fred eller folks personlige sikkerhed undg s inklusiv sl ringen af nummerplader og personer ansigter selvom det ikke kan udelukkes at billeder kan bruges til at identificere individer er det tydeligt at google gerne vil fotografere gader og ikke enkeltpersoner
104265 we did say that it would be difficult to get repetitions for the third guy now that hes getting some repetitions were doing it in a fashion that keeps it i guess you could say in all fairness if hes going to replace somebodys reps hell take those first team reps
104266 i had no expectations about when my reps would come
104267 its strictly about me being ready if they would have said the first day to jump in there i would have been ready if they say it a month from now im going to be ready its my job to be ready
104268 because with the limited reps hes had so far if it was all new to him this year he wouldnt be where he is
104269 thinking about if im more comfortable than anyone else is not an efficient use of what i want to be doing right now in camp
104270 its about preparing to come out here and play well and then playing well
104271 theres no question to me that j t osullivan is tough
104272 hes competitive hes resilient now if he can play quarterback thatd be great
104273 you want to be out there getting the reps but im just trying to get mental reps back there and be ready to go
104274 its going to happen in fairness ive got three guys competing for it
104275 just because of the way reps are its difficult to be 100 percent fair with reps but were doing the best we can
104276 you are not on my train at all chief next question
104277 develop a downtown master plan with specific areas to redevelop and a timetable for doing so

104293 i have not found one bone of my children yet and there he is alive
104294 today i feel there is a bit of justice in this otherwise really pitiful world
104295 its the beast i did not believe it until now
104296 happy because the world seems to be not as bad as i thought so far if it forced him to the courtroom sad because 100 000 people he killed are not watching this
104297 to negotiate an agreement with milosevic and two of karadzics henchmen that karadzic would quit as president of the serbian portion of bosnia and as head of his political party immediately and disappear from public life
104298 reluctantly signed that agreement without ever coming to the negotiations
104299 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
104300 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
104301 should exercise utmost restraint to avoid the possibility of armed confrontation so that the current problem may be settled through peaceful means
104302 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced

104311 men need to be raised by men you know theyre christian boys and hes a christian a hypocritical christian but still a christian he wasnt keen about taking them but i told him that he had no choice like it or not i was married to him for 19 years we had a good run i still love him im just not in love with him weve got to keep it together though if for no other reason than for the kids were divorced but they need to know that we still love each other

104332 i am not asking you to take them out of the world but i ask you to protect them from the evil one they do not belong to the world just as i do not belong to the world
104333 whatever the new york times suggests we do we will do the opposite
104334 this is the sign youve been looking for you were meant to read these words
104335 im relishing the challenge it will be like my first year in the premier league
104336 last year was a start stop situation with the injuries but i will come back fully fit and hopefully i will play my part pushing for a starting spot
104337 there will be a lot of competition for places but hopefully i will keep myself in the picture
104338 i wouldnt say it was a disappointment but certainly there was a bit of sadness
104339 it could have been any of the players who were injured but unfortunately it was me
104340 but in any sport injuries happen i look back on it and it happened for a reason
104341 i am a positive thinking type of guy and i am not going to dwell on the past
104342 i have already put last season behind me and i am only concentrating on this season and being fully fit making sure the things i didnt do for last season i will be 100 sure i can do this season
104343 no disrespect to the championship but when you do come into the premier league you have to raise your game at least five or 10 steps
104344 it is a faster quicker game and you are playing against top international players
104345 obviously they are not going to give you as much time and space as championship teams give you
104346 you have to learn quickly in the premier league because no one is going to give you time to get that experience
104347 to have a team going up just touching the 80 point mark as champions is incredible and to have any team survive in the division needing 52 points or more again tells you just how tight this division is
104348 the difference between ourselves and the play offs was only 15 points which is five wins and if you look back over our season im sure everybody can identify more than five games we should have won
104349 if last seasons championship taught us anything its that there is no such thing as an easy fixture in this league
104350 one thing is for certain the championship is going to be ultra competitive and we will need to be tuned in and 100 prepared from day one
104351 weve got birmingham reading and derby coming down who will all be very strong and weve got the likes of swansea coming up and nottingham forest who will definitely be spending
104352 he makes some incredibly foolish plays on the bases and in the field
104353 who woulda thunk creationists and republicans had bum bum sex
104354 the values of our existing vessels and vessels in our order book have inflated dramatically while the increases in newbuilding prices are relatively smaller this gives us a chance to renew and expand our fleet through the sale and purchase arrangement
104355 i dont want to be a bit part player but that ultimately is down to me and how well i play
104356 im not here to make up the numbers im getting to the end of my career but i still have the hunger to do well and i cant wait to get started
104357 hopefully my experience can help those around me i did that at luton last year and i like passing on the things ive learned throughout my own career
104358 at my age chances are few and far between and im delighted to be here
104359 its a great club and with the way the team finished last season i think we can do really well next year
104360 i bring a lot of experience to the table hopefully i am able to pass on my knowledge to the younger players here
104361 its difficult to judge how youre doing from pre season friendlies theyre about getting fit so you cant really read too much into things yet you judge yourself from the start of the season
104362 im definitely confident were going to do well because its a young squad here and with a lot of talent and were all raring to go we just want the serious stuff to start
104363 were not expecting him to play 54 games and 90 minutes every game
104364 i didnt hit the sweet spot for a couple of races although at the last few races the car has been the best it has ever been
104365 it should be that way weve been working very hard to develop it and weve seen the evolution of the car for me personally to rediscover that sweet spot ive spent a lot more time with my engineer analysing things and trying to work out where we have gone wrong on weekends
104366 what weve done at recent tests at hockenheim silverstone and jerez weve really extracted the most from them that is all due to reliability making good parts and with all that weve made some good steps forward
104367 i didnt know that but its of no importance to me at all to be honest
104368 i would just like to continue with the momentum i have to score more points this weekend
104369 if we have the car to win then we will go for that otherwise it would be nice to just be on the podium before the break
104370 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
104371 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
104372 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
104373 we are well prepared since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
104374 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control we have ordered six new boeing 777 300er aircraft for delivery beginning in 2010 they are 23 more fuel efficient than the boeing 747 400 and give us additional flexibility in the long haul fleet
104375 im pleased to say that talks towards a merger with spanish carrier iberia are under way this is good news for both airlines our shareholders and our customers
104376 if im honest its taken a while but its nice to get past 200 but i should have done it 15 or 20 tests ago
104377 but i want to take a lot more than that for the team and i want to perform better than i have before and i want to keep improving
104378 at this time statistics dont mean that much to me maybe when im older ill sit down and look at them
104379 when youre bowling against one of the best players in the world like kallis it brings the best out of me it was up there with one of my better spells

104415 ben haim is a good experienced premier league defender who maybe has a point to prove he feels he did not get enough games at chelsea and is looking to be involved a lot more here he will not be the only new arrival we are looking for good players in several positions and are working on a few deals
104416 they defended extremely well it was damage limitation from them really but you have to give them praise for their efforts
104417 their goalkeeper had a wonderful night they threw bodies in the way of everything and made life very difficult for us
104418 i was pleased with my lads they kept at them and if their goalkeeper had not had such a great night we would have won it at a canter

104420 my inspiration behind the ballet collection comes from my short stint with ballet class i felt so beautiful every time i went to class i wore a black leotard pink tights ballet slippers and my hair was pulled tightly into a perfect bun with the help of aquanet and bobby pins of course my mom would put blush on my cheeks and nose before class the farthest thing from my mind was looking in the mirror for flaws or imperfections i looked into the mirrored wall and felt so pretty i thought how could i translate this feeling i had into a jewelry collection soft pink nudes organza ruffles pleats and rhinestones
104421 it took a lot of trial and error i couldn t find a device that would make it the way i wanted so i had to create my own device to get the fabric to pleat and hang just right
104422 here have 45 million and by the way we think we can get kevin costner to do it
104423 in reality probably 95 of the facades on the universal backlot are really no older than five years or so because the fronts are made up of thin injection molded sheet plastic foam and cheap plywood whenever i had my golf cart on the backlot there would always be big pieces lying on the road that had fallen off and whenever a new film production would come in they would just hammer up their own look onto the facade front probably the oldest thing that burned up in the recent fire was the king kong figure
104424 i worked on the street for a few months supervising the cowboys who for one summer 1999 staged a mock shootout as each tram drove by between this use and later for a couple of halloween haunts seasons the tour replaced more than 75 of the denver street facades
104425 some of the confusion probably stems from the policy of when your production company tears down an existing facade to put in something else that when your production is completed you have to build a copy of what was there before so a lot of the facades look just like they are remembered in the movies but are usually faithful reproductions of what was there before
104426 what the tour guides tell everyone is what they are told to tell everyone you have to remember they are acting to a script there is no real curse to the mummys tomb and they know there is going to be a flashflood but do they know the true history that i dont know

104430 the guests will have to tell the cast member what they want to say and the cast member will write it down i guess the city hall cast members will have to brush up on their dictation skills if a guest insists on writing a comment themselves they will be directed to the resorts web site and fill out a form under the contact us tab why are we doing this dont know
104431 what will happen is a themed canopy will be put up over the courtyard cash registers added and it will be festooned with christmas merchandise as an extension of the tiny christmas shop that borders it
104432 the plans are pretty similar to has been done with the pieces of eight shop and how they extended the location into the royal street courtyard
104433 the cemetery will have the same headstones as in the past unless something changes between now and christmas the pirates craze on the island has died down hopefully the area from the fort and beyond will be left as is in the world of tom and huck

104440 there are certain tools out there to see whether youre on the high end of a three or four block radius
104441 given that cook county has a superior web site we as individual homeowners should be able to file our own appeal
104442 no homeowner should feel that they have to hire a professional bigwig to do it unless they are strapped for time or they feel a bit intimidated try to do it on your own at least on the ground level at the assessors office
104443 we advise people to not even bring that up because its totally ineffective
104444 i literally saw someone with a small kid in tow dressed as pathetically as they could be and said they were going to lose their home they were being totally honest it has zero effect dont even waste the assessors time
104445 developers are under financial strain and seem to be cutting the quality of the finished buildings whenever possible leading to more cases against them by new associations
104446 theyre dealing with people who are not paying assessments or theyve got a dog and the rules say you cant have a dog
104447 homeowners have gotten more savvy with how not to comply with the rules and boards have to follow their system of due process
104448 youre volunteering for the board you dont get paid there are no real benefits other than having a say in the policies of the association and now youre more on the hook for those things
104449 know the sequence of events the people involved and the financial information
104450 organize your thoughts and if necessary put them in writing ahead of time
104451 they want your story and they are going to use it in whatever way will work best for them
104452 you think people are friendly and nice and cordial but in the end they are looking for information to use against you
104453 they start to think they gave the wrong answer and try to rationalize it or explain why the answer is what it is and sometimes that gives away too much information
104454 if you testify to something different at trial that will come back to hurt you if you say i dont know or cant recall that can be explored and you dont look like a liar later on
104455 if you dont have all of your is dotted and ts crossed if you dont follow the due process that the declaration or bylaws or condo act require your case could get thrown out or the judgment could go in favor of the homeowner with the illegal dog

104457 it could be something simple like one shingle that came loose or the flashing around the dormer is open
104458 this is aimed at developers looking to deploy across multiple screens looking to leverage the java ubiquity
104459 our strength comes from the ubiquity of the java runtime in the mobile area where we are pervasive and in the six million java developers who can extend their capabilities to provide web resident apps and can do it in a faster time frame
104460 we are architecting it to the idea of cross device content where developers can build applications to a common api and if you write to that your app is deployable to any device capable of running javafx
104461 we initially thought flash flex would be easier to start with but in the end it was harder to do certain functions
104462 javafx gives us the advantage of tying into those tried and true java apis that are vital to our app so while the tools are lacking they are going to be there

104467 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
104468 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
104469 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
104470 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
104471 by hosting the beijing games we will show the world that the chinese people are a peace loving nation

104591 wenn frau mikl leitner es wirklich super findet dass ab herbst die kindergartenpl tze aufgestockt werden dann sollte sie dazusagen dass das nicht passiert weil die vp n pl tzlich entdeckt hat dass qualitative betreuungspl tze f r kinder und deren berufst tige eltern eine absolute notwendigkeit sind sondern weil im kindergartengesetz auf druck der sp die ffnung der kinderg rten auch f r 2 5 j hrige stattfindet
104592 wir wollten schon immer entscheidungsfreiheit anbieten frauen m ssen berufliche perspektiven haben sich aber auch f r eine familie mit kindern entscheiden k nnen
104593 und noch vor wenigen monaten hat mikl leitner dies als zwangsverpflichtendes ddr kinderbetreuungsmodell bezeichnet

104595 jede zweite frau nennt eine geeignete kinderbetreuung als ideale bedingung f r den wiedereinstieg doch gerade f r junge familien im l ndlichen raum ist die vereinbarkeit von familie und beruf oft ein schwieriges unterfangen

104617 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
104618 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
104619 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
104620 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
104621 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
104622 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
104623 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
104624 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
104625 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
104626 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
104627 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
104628 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
104629 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
104630 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
104631 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
104632 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
104633 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
104634 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
104635 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
104636 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
104637 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
104638 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
104639 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
104640 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
104641 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
104642 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
104643 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
104644 you have value on the ground more than you spent
104645 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
104646 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
104647 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
104648 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
104649 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
104650 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one

104672 no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms the strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government
104673 with the global battle for business more intense than ever countries and their economic development organisations need to pay close attention to the results of this survey
104674 whether accurate or misguided perceptions about a locations business climate often play a crucial role in site selection where companies invest money and create jobs
104675 the majority of these visits were made by ministers and officials to encourage the government of india to press for liberalisation of indias legal services sector

104684 i would take his call now i will take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
104685 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big
104686 i wanted to offer him something that he didnt have a rally song one that really captures that maverick spirit
104687 he was physically tortured for years and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades

104723 der unterschied zu unseren annahmen geht vor allem auf die personalkosten zur ck die um 16 prozent unter unseren erwartungen gelegen hatten

104725 das bedeutet aber letztlich dass noch schwere quartale auf die deutsche b rse zukommen werden
104726 should we try to fix this or just accept it as it is
104727 nichole3 wrote in the comments section about her history with clotheslines
104728 i had no dryer a great deal of the time my children were growing up i always had my clothsline full if we had special plans on the weekend i started washing friday night and got up early saturday mornings to have my entire clothesline filled with four children i always had to wash at least 2 loads a day i have to admit it was not always fun i use my line now mainly for sheets and blankets
104729 send the holy ghost to witness that it is true
104730 when you tell the missionaries you dont need to pray about the book of mormon theyll think youre copping out that youre afraid to learn the truth admittedly youll seem like a cad if you simply refuse and leave it at that you need to provide them with an explanation for refusing
104731 the devout mormon believes this text is inspired because joseph smith said it is he believes smith had the authority to claim divine inspiration for the book of mormon because the book itself says smith was a prophet and had such authority
104732 you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the powers of death shall not prevail against it
104733 as non catholic historians admit it can be demonstrated easily that early church writers such as ignatius of antioch eusebius clement of rome and polycarp had no conception of mormon doctrine and they knew nothing of a great apostasy
104734 nowhere in their writings can one find references to christians embracing any of the peculiarly mormon doctrines such as polytheism polygamy celestial marriage and temple ceremonies if the church of the apostolic age was the prototype of todays mormon church it must have had all these beliefs and practices but why is there no evidence of them in the early centuries before the alleged apostasy began
104735 church history is catholic the fact is that there is no historical or archaeological indication of any kind that the early church was other than the catholic church g hey even lots of other churches would argue against that let me introduce you to them assyrian church of the east the coptic orthodox church of alexandria the armenian apostolic church the greek orthodox church the russian orthodox church the ethiopian orthodox church the roman catholic church the original thomas christians in india other eastern orthodox and oriental orthodox churches the old catholic church the polish national catholic church and the anglican communion when dealing with mormon missionaries remember that all the evidence is in favor of the claims of the catholic church if you want to watch their sails go slack quickly ask the missionaries to produce any historical proof to support their claim that in the early centuries the church was mormon they cant do it because there is no such evidence
104736 the book of mormon itself suffers the same fate when it comes to its own historical support in a word it hasnt got any
104737 lifting from the king james bible there are other problems with the book of mormon for example critics of mormonism have shown convincing proof that the book of mormon is a synthesis of earlier works written by other men of the vivid imaginings of joseph smith and of simple plagiarisms of the king james bible
104738 the only bible that joseph smith relied on was the king james version this translation was based on a good but imperfect set of greek and hebrew manuscripts of the bible scholars now know the textus receptus contains errors which means the king james version contains errors the problem for mormons is that these exact same errors show up in the book of mormon it seems reasonable to assume that since smith was a prophet of god and was translating the book of mormon under divine inspiration he would have known about the errors found in the king james version and would have corrected them for when passages from the king james version appeared in the book of mormon but the errors went in
104739 according to a standard mormon theological work doctrines of salvation one finds this definition
104740 if the book of mormon contains all the ordinances and principles that pertain to the gospel why dont mormonisms esoteric doctrines show up in it
104741 the bottom line the book of mormon fails on three main counts first it utterly lacks historical or archaeological support and there is an overwhelming body of empirical evidence that refutes it
104742 second the book of mormon contains none of the key mormon doctrines
104743 textual errors factual errors and outright plagiarisms from other works
104744 if youre asked by mormon missionaries to point out examples of such errors here are two you can use
104745 shall be born of mary at jerusalem which is in the land of our forefathers
104746 another problem scientists have demonstrated that honey bees were first brought to the new world by spanish explorers in the fifteenth century but the book of mormon in ether 2 3 claims they were introduced around 2000 b c the problem was that joseph smith wasnt a naturalist he didnt know anything about bees and where and when they might be found he saw bees in america and threw them in the book of mormon as a little local color he didnt realize hed get stung by them
104747 i dont feel like it right now thank you i feel fine

104759 the discovery of phenomena like the laws of nature the communications network of the parable has led scientists philosphers and others to accept the existence of an infinitely intelligent mind

104767 in the end it became evident to me that the house leadership team never really bought into the senates
104768 i believe to let the bill die with the senates language on the final day was the wrong decision it would have been a significant first step in dealing with this issue we could have come back next year with further adjustments incorporating the houses well thought out approach

104808 this investigation is in response to concerns raised by a small number of staff
104809 we have identified around 25 people and they are a myriad of different cancer types
104810 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers
104811 we really felt that if staff are concerned about it the only way to address those concerns was to retain some consultants and conduct a proper and thorough investigation so we can give them a high level of comfort that there isnt a problem
104812 i dont believe there really is a cluster here at all but we need to take it seriously

104823 woolworths understands that there is genuine hardship across the transport industry
104824 woolworths pays appropriate national fuel levies to all its transport providers
104825 it is our expectation and our transport providers responsibility that these fuel levies are passed on to any drivers who are subcontracted by our direct transport providers
104826 as a company that depends on transport woolworths accepts that higher fuel prices are a fact of life
104827 all sectors of the logistics industry must work together to ensure that we can meet the challenges ahead rather than unfairly placing blame on selected participants
104828 we maintain the big transport clients who are the ones contracting the drivers to do their work they are basically holding out on paying these drivers a fair rate of pay

104847 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
104848 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
104849 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
104850 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

104869 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
104870 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits

104872 we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
104873 we are well prepared since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions

104880 our talks with american airlines and iberia towards further co operation are progressing well
104881 despite the difficult situation the industry is in we remain absolutely focused on the interests of our customers
104882 price increases are being implemented to reflect fuel cost rises but will have an impact on volumes

104946 it is more than obvious now that the ruthless destruction of serbia during the 1999 nato bombing was carried out with one goal and that is to turn the province of kosovo metohija into the first nato state in the world
104947 bomb the civilians and the civilian structures until that countrys military cant stand to watch it anymore

104968 after making the decision to create the tattoo sourcebook i immediately began researching studios and websites that had access to different tattoo designs
104969 i spoke to tattoofinder com owner lou bardach and he thought the sourcebook concept as i presented it was a fantastic idea but it wasnt enough he wanted to give an authoritative and informative introduction to the tattoo process and he couldnt have been more right nearly 2 000 designs and 40 different artists later the tattoo sourcebook was born
104970 we approach these collaborative efforts first and foremost by focusing on our customers needs
104971 we then look for innovative ways to leverage our assets and build mutually beneficial relationships with other companies oftentimes valuing our long term goals over short term monetary gains
104972 our decision to work with tattoofinder was based on the incredible volume of traffic their site generates
104973 as well as their solid ethical reputation as the leading source for high quality tattoo designs it takes time for a newer company to build a strong presence on the web and doing so generally requires a huge advertising budget we felt working with tattoofinder com in co branded content distribution was a good move for both parties we look forward to finding other creative ways to work together to enhance each others brand extend our reach and increase industry authority
104974 the secret to our success is giving our visitors exactly what they want in the most clear direct way possible
104975 what our customers want is great tattoo artwork and reliable information and my mission is to make this experience as easy and effective as possible its not some kind of seo trick or backroom dealings with search engines like google in fact its the exact opposite philosophy thats made us successful honesty tattoofinder com has become synonymous with top quality tattoo artwork and authoritative information about the tattoo process simply because thats what we offer nothing more nothing less
104976 just as actual tattoos have moved beyond bikers and soldiers to rock stars and actors iconic tattoo imagery has gained influence just as aggressively
104977 our artwork is a powerhouse resource not only as tattoo friendly reference to get inked but also for merchandise friendly advertising friendly and promotion friendly tattoo images while people fanatically tattoo their skin businesses are equally enthusiastic about tattooing clothing electronic devices advertising campaigns and sometimes their company identity
104978 our customers are interested in fashion sports music and entertainment all industries with very strong ties historically and socially to the tattooed and tattoo culture in general from a marketing perspective its in our interest to build integrated long term business relationships with companies having good tattoo synergy we develop and foster these strategic partnerships through trust over time and with each party looking for new and creative ways to support and collaboratively promote each other
104979 we could have simply licensed artwork to harpercollins for the tattoo sourcebook
104980 but we saw an opportunity to work with them more closely to produce and promote a truly epic book we could have simply sold advertising space to inked magazine on our website but saw opportunity in the magazines high end print market we took a creative approach in both cases toward building solid long term business relationships that have benefited us benefited our partners and most importantly benefited our customers

105005 thats exactly what we need in a president somebody that can handle the tough decisions somebody who wont flinch in the face of danger
105006 hes a president and hes going to be the president who will bring determination to defeat an enemy and a heart big enough to love those who hurt
105007 iran is dedicated to the destruction of israel that alone should concern us but now they are trying for nuclear capabilities i totally support the president when he says we will not allow iran to destroy israel
105008 if you get involved in a major ground war in the saudi desert i think support will erode significantly nor should it be supported we cannot even contemplate in my view trading american blood for iraqi blood

105025 there are always hot spots but they are always moving
105026 hot spots are dynamic entities you can predict the location by looking at climate and tectonics
105027 the areas that are most diverse are not the warmest areas
105028 usually if there are mass extinctions theyre more severe when you are in that second phase of the hot spot cycle
105029 there have been at least three marine biodiversity hotspots during the past 50 million years
105030 they have moved across almost half the globe with their timing and locations coinciding with major tectonic events
105031 its clearly something we cant do anything about but the hotspot is more vulnerable than it used to be 6 or 10 million years ago
105032 its more vulnerable so you have to be extra cautious about what you do its closer to the edge than it was
105033 theres been no genetic information from the kimberley so they may be a separate species again
105034 were doing work here and in the northern territory to clarify whether the dolphins were seeing are an australian snubfin or another new species
105035 but if the populations are very isolated it means they need even more protection because theres not a huge gene pool
105036 in 1997 in eastern parts of nepal there were about 67 nests
105037 and in four or five years in 2001 there was zero
105038 so that rapidly they declined from india nepal and pakistan and over 12 years they started declining now more than 95 of the vultures number has gone down
105039 it is also anti inflammatory but has been tested against vultures and other birds of prey and general birds and does not cause damage to these birds
105040 yes they are ugly looking but they are really helpful for us
105041 see within half an hour they finished eating all that dead animal only the skeleton is left it is really helpful to clean the nature
105042 traditionally we see the vulture as a very bad bird
105043 if it passes your house then the house has to be purified they can bring danger
105044 but that belief is disappearing people realise that vultures eat rotten things and we must preserve them
105045 we tell them about the new medicine meloxicam and how we can save the birds by using it
105046 once we established the vulture restaurant in five or six months we found double that number the maximum number i have recorded is about 156 all at the same time on the same carcass
105047 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
105048 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
105049 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
105050 elephants also are a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries
105051 public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again
105052 the work with dna sampling allows us to focus law enforcement on poaching hot spots
105053 it forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders and it also gives us more insight on where to look so that hopefully we can stop the poachers before the elephants are actually killed
105054 there are indications that elements of the isi provided support to those who eventually carried out the attack
105055 the indians set up one of these missions in kandahar just across its border and that one is really driving the pakistanis crazy
105056 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
105057 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
105058 the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue our policy of return on success
105059 this time horizon is a planning tool not a definitive schedule
105060 before it was a status of forces agreement presented as a long term agreement with some hope one day foreign troops will end their mandate
105061 now we are talking about when foreign forces are going to cease their operations
105062 i think we have to wait until those negotiations finish to really know the details

105068 i have a responsibility to make sure that our state has enough money to pay its bills
105069 it is a terrible situation to be in i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation but this is really the only way out at this point
105070 the state of california the elected leadership cannot put the important public servants of california in harms way
105071 we put people first we make sure we protect their interests and thats why i have to tell the governor with all due respect i am not going to comply with this order
105072 people are going to get put out of their homes
105073 the governor says hes sorry we cant pay with sorry
105074 we believe budget reform is an essential element and we also appreciate there may be some tax loopholes that need to be closed

105079 there has to be the right amount of heat and water
105080 at this point given what we are seeing we are not going to have a surge in cases
105081 ive heard a lot of names that we were supposed to be getting
105082 it would be great if we had gotten some of those guys but i didnt really think we needed them we have a lot of good players here
105083 i would like to say thats the way were supposed to play
105084 we have a good team good athletes as a group capable of playing the way we played here
105085 we would give our own lives in order to know what happened to our missing relatives and to make the executioners assume their responsibility
105086 on september 11 1973 my life changed for ever that morning my father left the house and never came back i was 22 years old i believe that the love and the happiness he gave us in my childhood and afterwards gave me the strength to live life with the intensity that i have
105087 when we claimed that our relatives were being tortured they said that does not happen in chile three months after the disappearance the president of the supreme court suggested that i write a book because as he said you have a great imagination
105088 until 78 we still believed in the possibility that they were alive but then the rest of 15 farmers that had been shot were discovered
105089 it was a pathetic paradox that our government invoked humanitarian reasons to repatriate him and negotiated with england and spain to judge him in the country
105090 if we could survive the dictatorship and overcome the fear i will not worry about what is going to happen to me now
105091 the army gave information on 175 cases among which appears my fathers indicating that he was thrown into the sea
105092 when a bus driver does not take the money for my ticket or when they give me flowers or embrace me and say we hope you will find him se ora
105093 there are always things to do to fight against the impunity that prevails here
105094 i would say that i am a very special militant
105095 there was a very important verdict in december 1994 and for the first time there was a sentence in the case of a missing prisoner
105096 the crime of kidnapping has permanent character because the action created a criminal state that was extended in time subsisting the injury of the affected legal interest
105097 and pinochet may be an old man but he is not innocent of introducing with blood and fire a terrible constitution the effects of which are still seen today
105098 beloved father your family companions and friends render to you a deserved and just tribute we will recover you from the earth from the silence of those who using their power arrested you and tortured you until you died there are so many that we have not found yet they give us the motivation to continue walking along this path that will allow us to recover the dignity of our country as we recover the entire truth and reach full justice
105099 lord please help me accept the decision that i have just received it burns my heart with anger and disappointment and i am starting to feel envious of others my mind wanted me to accept it but my heart and my principles prevent me from doing so if they have closed the door to my face i pray that you open a window or much better open a back door for me amen

105104 i thought we could be the pinnacle of production for italian varieties publicized by antinori and mondavi
105105 most of the winemakers that were making italian varietals didnt have a f clue about what italian wine tasted like
105106 all they cared about was what their neighbor was making and they had no idea what was going on in the world
105107 if you think pinot noir is tough to grow and vinify sangiovese is pinot noir squared and nebbiolo is pinot noir cubed
105108 nebbiolo is the toughest red grape to make in the known universe
105109 10 it buds out too early 9 it ripens too late 8 it has too high in acid and tannin
105110 twenty five years of experience with the variety is the key and we still have so much more to learn
105111 nebbiolo may never succeed in california if it has to any degree its where pinot noir was in 1970 when there were a handful of decent ones but it wasnt on anyones radar screen
105112 with vineyards now approaching 20 years old were getting better concentration and consistency
105113 we considered giving up on it but its a labor of love
105114 weve all gone to the italian restaurant and you meet the italian guy
105115 i had that experience at angelini on melrose one of the best trattorias in los angeles
105116 i showed him my wines and he was blown away i said are you going to buy any he says no because i have my italian wines i said wait a sec you have burgundy and you have russian river valley pinot noir you have napa cabernet and you have bordeaux should you have only rhone syrah and none of this australian shiraz he says you know you have a point but did he buy any no
105117 i dont want to hear the term cal ital anymore
105118 now people are interested in whats new and different you need to be a little bit zealous about it and have a good story and a lot of confidence you have to be willing to accept a little defeat
105119 how long did it take california and oregon to figure our how to make pinot noir with consistency its at least as tough to make sangiovese as pinot noir
105120 yes but i probably wouldnt be if it was much harder to sell

105132 qualche utente si lamentato del fatto che il contatore sia inattendibile e non rispetti effettivamente il numero delle visite
105133 poliedrica gran burlone e organizzatore di scherzi sincera affezionata dolce e coccolosa
105134 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
105135 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
105136 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
105137 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
105138 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
105139 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto
105140 hai un rapporto piuttosto concreto e stabile con il tuo denaro non ami sbilanciarti fare il cosiddetto passo pi lungo della gamba non nel tuo stile questo per non significa che tu non sappia toglierti certe soddisfazioni sei concreto e attento al risparmio ma anche disposto a sacrifici per coltivare i tuoi interessi la tua sembrerebbe la politica vincente il modo migliore per godersi la vita
105141 i pensieri che corrono le frasi che segnano le emozioni che proviamo
105142 sei la persona pi tenera e dolce che abbia mai incontrato in questo mondo fatato
105143 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano
105144 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
105145 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora
105146 i tuoi post sono molto belli e fatti con amore complimenti
105147 credo che il tuo blog sia sempre stato uno dei pi interessanti
105148 leggo spesso il tuo blog sono una tra tante e mi piace un sacco quello che hai da dire
105149 se il blog fosse un paese tu saresti sicuramente la piazza del duomo
105150 quando non mi senti parlare vuol dire che sto parlando dentro
105151 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
105152 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice
105153 quando vedi qualcuno che invidioso di te guardalo negli occhi e digli
105154 niente che non fosse vero ho solo riscritto il tuo in maniera diversa
105155 i figli sono strani un giorno sono piccoli triciclisti e un altro giorno jumbo jettano verso luniversit
105156 sorridi anche se sei triste perch non c nulla di pi triste della tristezza di non poter sorridere
105157 were not selling a lot but customers like it when they taste it then come back for it
105158 carmenere is one of the more popular wines with our customers along with malbec
105159 its a great wine to pair with food it can go with spicier dishes
105160 im seeing interesting things like pinot noir coming from chile but carmenere not so much
105161 people dont come looking for carmenere they are asking for argentinian malbec
105162 there are not a lot of upscale chilean restaurants to serve chilean wine
105163 carmenere has unfamiliar flavors some people either love or hate
105164 i do well with a carmenere when it is an international style even people with more of a european palate may have trouble if the wine has too much green and vegetal aromas and flavors
105165 you had quinine port you had quinine sherry you had quinine madeira
105166 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting
105167 we have to fight them over them before they come over here
105168 hello dr frank im mary tillman i dont want to waste your time im calling to ask you a question do you think its possible that this administration orchestrated my sons death
105169 im positively stunned by his response i thought he would gently tell me that he doesnt believe the administration is very honorable but it would never do something so heinous as to have a soldier killed
105170 i think its possible mrs tillman im a psychiatrist it would be unethical and irresponsible of me to tell a grieving mother to pursue such a thing if i didnt think it was possible
105171 indicating that pat was a very special young man the language rumsfeld used was that pat was world class and that they should keep an eye on him
105172 im not sure what that meant but writing something like that writing a letter to pat obviously hes going to be concerned when hes killed hes going to want to know what happened
105173 by how the government has betrayed not only pat but also the american public
105174 its consuming and emotionally draining but very revealing it takes weeks there are days i become very angry that my family and i have to do this just to get the truth that should have been forthcoming from the moment pat died
105175 the panel has failed it received a flurry of white house e mails but no documents about friendly fire it interviewed several top white house officials not a single one could recall when he learned about the fratricide or what he did in response
105176 heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism how passionately i hate them
105177 one of the ideas behind it is to give a reality to violence
105178 one of the things that happens through television particularly is that we view violence in a very abstract way as something that doesnt really involve pain and suffering and fear
105179 creating this experience in this venue gives us the opportunity to explore violence and allows the audience to experience violence in their face

105208 there has been much talk recently of how people in towns and cities in this country may have somehow forgotten or lost their civic link with the armed forces that has never been the case here in sunderland
105209 it was fantastic to get elements of the regiment back on parade in sunderland
105210 we have been looking forward to exercising our freedom of sunderland for some time

105234 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
105235 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
105236 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
105237 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign

105246 sorry manny not unless you want to sleep in bunk beds
105247 manny was not demanding anything from the red sox contractually
105248 this wasnt about free agency it was about being comfortable and if he stayed in boston he was going to do his best

105266 this is why the female offender keeps everyone guessing with deception keep people chasing their tails and they dont have the time to fight you you will often find female offenders are remarkably good at making people do what they want they are especially skilled at manipulating men women know there is more than one way to make a man wild she can seduce him she can lead him in circles when that fails she can kill seduce circle kill
105267 in her eyes those close to her are mere things that can be tossed in the trash when they get in the way follow her men and you will follow her thinking what that means is female predators are especially driven by their need to feel sexual and appealing they need their men more than they need their families male attention is exciting while family is judgmental men build her ego but their children tear it down what feeds her ego if you figure this out you figure her out seduce circle kill

105539 we still have not fixed a date for the questioning of the two adult children but it has now emerged that they could make use of their right not to speak to the authorities and refuse to give evidence against their father
105540 the matter will be discussed between their lawyer and the judge in charge but it has been suggested that they decline to give any statement
105541 there is no direct forensic evidence due to the time elapsed and there is no body since he allegedly burnt the baby in an oven the charges could therefore only be based on the testimony of his daughter in addition in order to stand up the charges of manslaughter one would need to attain evidence that there was premeditation as well as evidence that the child would have survived had it received medical attention

105571 the eastern pacific is in essence a natural laboratory to study how coral reef ecosystems are structured and function under these acidic conditions
105572 this is key because laboratory studies are limited in the timescale over which they can be conducted so we as a research community dont yet understand the full ramifications of acidification on whole reef structure and function
105573 this is of concern because it has been found that healthy corals build reef structures at rates only slightly greater than they are ultimately destroyed by physical biological and chemical erosive processes
105574 thus any declines in the rate of skeletal production or in the rates of binding cement precipitation implies that coral reefs will become net erosional with increasing acidification
105575 the abundance of the cements appears to inversely relate to the rate of bioerosion previously documented for these reefs
105576 in other words where these cements are non existent bioerosion rates are the highest documented in the entire world these cements appear to act like a glue that may minimize the rates at which erosive processes occur on reefs
105577 i hope to add some western pacific sites to my studies and have a few reef site candidates already in mind that are also impacted by upwelling processes

105580 this land was just scrub land its not been farmed for eight or nine years so we have to cut away the vegetation the grass and all the trees and begin the cultivation process
105581 the soil is very good and very consistent considered one of the best growing mediums in the world and the large scale this field is the size of an average farm in england

105601 to keep this in perspective though you ve got to remember that in addition to price changes technology and crop mix can impact per acre energy costs
105602 adopting no till or reduced tillage systems for example is a change in technology adoption of those systems has increased in recent years and as a result this on going change in tillage systems actually dampened the impact that 2007 s energy price hikes had on energy related cropping costs

105606 right now i know im in a good position because roger has to win everything from here from olympics to us open
105607 but i dont think too much right now i only think about trying to improve my game for tomorrow
105608 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
105609 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
105610 i guess ill analyse and assess my game after the us open
105611 for the moment its just all a blur so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard
105612 its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
105613 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
105614 i havent played against top 10 players so much in my career so beating one of them gives me more confidence
105615 i knew that hes a tougher opponent on hard court than he is on clay so i was a little bit nervous but as the match went on i played pretty well in the beginning though i lost my concentration in the second set
105616 wooo hold on there this two people are very well known and famous internet marketers who are you anyway to talk like this
105617 die realit t sieht oft deutlich besser aus als es die allgemeinen ngste nahe legen
105618 estaba completamente desnudo y utilizaba el agujero de la sombrilla para introducir su pene

105621 its unique i think for their college to field a team because they dont have an engineering school
105622 if you can get a group of folks who are really committed then you can do a lot
105623 we got to get out and walk across the finish line with the car it was great
105624 as they get more miles teams start to get more problems with the car
105625 once we left fargo we just started pulling away from the other teams
105626 one is theyre very well organized two is that theyve been able to stay on the road
105627 we do limit the surface area of the gallium cells
105628 the people who came in first are the people with the high performance cells
105629 theres not anything that i hold against any other teams that did use gallium cells
105630 i really dont think that would have been a deciding factor
105631 i think we did exceptionally well with what we had
105632 people are interested in finding new alternatives and for that matter being more conscious about their health
105633 the business higher education forum bhef to build national leadership network to improve college readiness access and success
105634 you can literally come to berea with nothing but what you can carry and graduate debt free
105635 parents really dont understand the true cost of college and the financial help that is available
105636 nor do they understand the difference between loans grants scholarships and work study funds
105637 i can remember in 1982 before the falklands war margaret thatcher and the conservatives were in third place and then general galtieri invaded the falklands and the next thing we know she wins the biggest majority in history
105638 no we dont have the general galtieri i dont think we can do a staged invasion to make gordon brown popular
105639 aber das was er getan hat rechtfertigt nach 40 jahren arbeit f r die spd nicht einen parteiausschluss
105640 wir hoffen dass die bundesschiedskommission der spd den auf landesebene beschlossenen parteiausschluss zur cknimmt
105641 da haben parteijuristen nach den statuten einen einzelnen punkt bewertet und nicht die gesamtwertung vorgenommen das halte ich f r falsch
105642 wolfgang clement geh rt genauso zur spd wie andrea nahles und hermann scheer
105643 mit seinem namen und seiner reputation als ehemaliger spd vize und bundesminister hat clement eine woche vor einer landtagswahl dazu aufgerufen nicht die spd zu w hlen
105644 die aufregung um seinen m glichen parteiausschluss schadet eher der spd
105645 die spd tut sich damit berhaupt keinen gefallen weil wolfgang clement f r eine bestimmte politische richtung in der spd steht

105657 esteban vino a espa a por tener antecedentes familiares y ven a con el prop sito de jugar lo antes posible los papeles no llegaban y de un d a para otro los obtuvo ten a el dni
105658 no no era necesario es m s en los partidos denunciados por el obradoiro no figuraba el jugador en el acta porque estaba lesionado pero a n as era un jugador que podr a haber ocupado una plaza de extranjero al tratarse de un jugador determinante

105662 bueno esteban era un jugador important simo pero en el caso que no tuviera la nacionalidad espa ola si era necesaria o no su participaci n como extranjero correspond a al cuerpo t cnico
105663 arborists and landscapers are largely seasonal businesses and that can sometimes make acquiring financing for equipment and improvements difficult
105664 like arborists specialize in trees we specialize in helping small businesses get the financing they need to make the improvements so they can grow their businesses figuratively and literally
105665 there are a lot of financing options out there that involve taking out a home equity loan or borrowing against a 401 k to help fund capital improvements many times the business owner doesnt read the fine print of those agreements and ends up losing their home life savings or both
105666 we help businesses see that there are plenty of financing options out there that dont put your home or retirement at risk
105667 im extremely blessed to have had his friendship in my life one of the last concerts that i played with him was of all places in the caribbean coast of colombia in 2006 at the barranquijazz festival in my home country

105689 soldiering was so befitting to him to protect the very freedom to live life to its fullest
105690 i will be honest i had reservations about his second tour and i actually asked him to reconsider but jamess reply was mom its the right thing to do and i couldnt argue with that
105691 he was raised to care about the things that mattered and to make a difference he certainly didnt have to die to make us proud
105692 i would like to give our condolences to families and friends of fallen heroes my heart goes out to you all and it gives me some comfort to know that james is with your heroes
105693 maam im good im going back to iraq please help my family
105694 the fact that the 1st armored divisions 2nd brigade combat team ended up with a neurologist was really just a matter of luck

105697 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world has been waiting for

105701 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america

105703 well bootsy thats my cat started getting all nervous and i said whats the matter bootsy and then everything started shaking the plates fell from the cabinet including the one my mom gave to me on my wedding and which i plan on leaving to bootsy anyways things kept on shaking and then i thought i need to get outside so i went outside and started calling people everybodys ok thank god

105718 i loved the salt n pepa era with the bamboo earrings and the cut up jeans with the gold caps
105719 my all time favorite was my girl lil kims sequin outfit with one breast out i loved it and the matching lavender wig was dope
105720 lil kim is one of my favorite female rappers who changed the game with her style her style at the time was so unique and something so new she was sexy and raunchy but demanded respect from everyone it was so natural and seemed unforced
105721 looking at rihanna today she would have to be one person that i could see a reflection of myself in we both can change up our style at any given moment whether its a punk rock look glam look or around the way girl look we both always blend right in
105722 i feel like their are less and less artist who dare to be true trendsetters they are trendy though but its a big difference
105723 all the girls i know that had even a bit of tomboy in them went in with that whole style same as for with lil kim and foxy everyone went designer crazy

105764 since one page returns to the caller it might be worrying that the previous page will quickly flash up before navigating fortunately this is not the case as wpf waits for the return event handler to execute before loading or rendering the previous page if the return event handler from the calling page asks to navigate somewhere else wpf would perform the navigation without showing the page
105765 occurs when a called pagefunction returns and can only be handled by the calling page
105766 when using pagefunctions you need a reference to the object in order to subscribe to the event and for the handler to be invoked and so navigation with pagefunctions always involves the pagefunction object being left alive in memory similar to normal pages
105767 its actually quite concerning given that keepalive doesnt seem to affect regular pages depending on the navigation model but it does affect page functions

105779 the levy will commence on august 18 and be used for educating the public on the dangers of alcohol abuse rehabilitation programmes for victims of alcohol abuse and other good causes
105780 it is further disheartening that government has unilaterally targeted a single industry with this huge development without providing any notice let alone consultation with the industry
105781 imposing a 70 levy is a sledge hammer approach that fails to take into account the complexity of consumption and trade in alcohol
105782 last year the rough here was almost out of control
105783 this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring

105785 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this

105792 everything is getting expensive in abidjan but our salaries do not rise
105793 we cant even eat well and now the cost of transport is increasing
105794 this is killing us because when transport prices rise everything becomes more expensive
105795 in terms of the impact on the price of transportation it means the price of goods imported and exported increases and many of the goods imported are primarily food related so thats an extra cost especially to the poor
105796 everything increases our profit decreases its exhausting but this is happening worldwide we cant do anything about it

105813 actually i never did a complete run so im very very surprised and happy that i got the fastest time but i dont see how because i got so many penalties that i lost count i like the course its the same as last year i like the u k they kind of speak the same language that we do in california its the fourth race in the u k i won longleat once and won in london last year one year in longleat paul bonhomme won by default when we got rained out
105814 i was really calm on my first training run i wasnt feeling stressed at all i went into the track and did surprisingly well just feeling wise no matter what the time was coming back home to the airport i also realised i had done a good time too
105815 this year i prepared really well for london i spent a lot of time studying the track on dvds from last year ive done a lot of quality pre race preparation and i think that worked out really well
105816 its hurting right now and its more painful under high g but ill cowboy on and do my job
105817 right before i pulled up on a 12 g turn i hit some turbulence and it caused my head to drop down and then i came on with the g and my head kept continuing to go down the only way to get my head back up was to let up on the g and thats where i lost about a second im not back to where i need to be despite all the massages ive hurt my neck before but never this bad ive never had that happen where i couldnt pull my head back up under g i just hit the turbulence at the wrong fraction of a second had i known i was going to hit the turbulence id have gone through it and then pulled the 12 g but it all happened at once
105818 that training session was a complete waste of time because on my first run i was avoiding individual seagulls and on my second run i found a flock of about 200 seagulls
105819 i flew right the middle of them hit three of em weve got to make sure that the repair is absolutely perfect itll be ready again tomorrow im a little bit disappointed that no one else spotted 200 seagulls when you think of all the people watching youd think somebody would spot 200 seagulls
105820 due to the fact that we are flying in london one of the busiest cities in the world the worry is that we have just three minutes in the sky
105821 it is the first time out and it doesnt mean very much the first session we are just finding out about the course it is difficult to know what is coming
105822 we had made some adjustments before rotterdam that were really bad and it took us a long time to put it back to where it was in detroit
105823 i had to put it back to something that i knew what it was and that was a compromise now it is much much better and i am going to stick with it
105824 it is not very comfortable and we have less training time this time than normal
105825 i dont think about points i think about good flying
105826 you either have a point or you dont have one its better to concentrate on simply flying well
105827 the plan was to take it real gentle and just try to fly the course cleanly that went reasonably well i just got to put the speed up now and what what times i can get i didnt set a time today because the timing didnt trigger but i was able to put the sector times together and overall it was okay

105831 it was something i always wanted to do but i never really found anything i was interested in
105832 he said would you be interested in auditioning for the show
105833 and i said yeah i didnt really think it through it was just sort of a trigger response because i was a big terminator fan and then he said well you need to come in for audition tomorrow so i was in the audition process and i got the part before i really understood the full implications of what id gotten myself involved in
105834 shes the ceo of a corporation that develops certain technologies
105835 and shes very self empowered successful self assured singular so its a cool character to play
105836 like i just responded to that because i was young and disenfranchised and i wanted to be her i wanted to be empowered i wanted to kick ass i wanted to push back against the people that i felt werent treating me right and so i identified with her more than anything who doesnt want to be a terminator right
105837 i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet

105843 we evaluate every situation on a case by case basis and have no comment regarding the scrabulous developers new application at this time
105844 i do think the cosmetic changes on the new wordscraper board and the removal of any links to scrabble rules or dictionaries help dodge the copyright bullet
105845 by giving the power to the end users to control the design of the board including presumably the ability to change the board design back to the scrabulous design hasbro could still pursue a contributory infringement claim if it wanted to under the active inducement test
105846 but to win hasbro would have to show that the designers actively encouraged gamers to change the board back to the old scrabulous so far they dont seem to be stepping over this line
105847 but i really missed the trash talking with friends there are some friends i dont get to see that much but i played scrabulous with them
105848 all of my friends are really upset with hasbro and electronic arts and they didnt want to have anything to do with the game

105892 baltimore police also had a command van nearby in case of problems
105893 they were happy with the homicide numbers and didnt want to see a change in that
105894 of course i have no influence with those people in the drug world but i strongly suspected there would be a response and a response to that response
105895 i think the police knew that it wasnt the first time thered been a kidnapping in the city drug trade in general the response was predictable

105967 if he said good morning to me i wouldnt believe it was morning until i went to the window to check
105968 there is certainly a chance of putting together a coalition
105969 the big question is whether we will be able to get the budget passed with the world economy struggling we will have to keep the budget tight and so it will depend on whether a party like shas understands this the word child allowances is just a word you can always call it something else
105970 the chance of a new government being formed is very low
105971 the smell of elections is in the air and so when it comes to the coalition negotiations no party will want to be seen to be compromising thats because they know elections could be just around the corner and they might not be judged so kindly by their voters if they do
105972 she will say that we have to move forward on this front and that we have to go to the people in an election and win their support

105988 stenungsund is a 23 000 people community which covers an area of 254 square kilometres and is situated north of gothenburg the city started out as a summer town where people would go to the beach and they would only live here during the summer months
105989 the harbor town is surrounded by several smaller islands and a lot of forests
105990 every day they drive 45 minutes to their work but they do have a lot more open and green space to live here the region is certainly growing
105991 we are part of the local government and as such have a building office which puts money into the community
105992 we have 28 employees many of which are engineers like technical engineers plan engineers and water engineers they all need our services we are at the centre of the entire engineering force because they basically all need a map to do their work for instance we are currently building a large project where we will build 350 new buildings new roads and new pipes on the coast all those projects eventually come back to the level of the map
105993 for us to find the right points on the ground and to use these as points for the map can be difficult because there are so many hills and deep forests it can be hard to get a bearing we work with two pieces of topcons hiper gps and one total station the gpt 9003a we have had the topcon instruments for one year now we use the total station on the pipelines and heights we chose topcon for the ease it is easier to handle than other products you can clearly see all the points on the display you have a map with you where you can see where you are at we use the gps for setting out points and check the height with the total station
105994 the gpt 9003a was an easy choice for us we were looking for a piece of quality and it is user friendly it is very important that it is user friendly because not everybody that works with it here is a surveyor one of the advantages is that the files are easily interchangeable from the gps to the total station as we work with the same data collector in between the topcon fc 200 with radio it basically offers us one user interface the data collector software on the gps and on the total station can give a complete view of the map between these systems it is easy to move files

105997 hurrying to kill this wanton tyrant king abdullah who has announced himself to be a leader of atheism would be among the most pious acts
105998 the call for a rapprochement of religions issued by the saudi tyrant is an integral part of the overt crusader war against islam and muslims
105999 this in fact is a call to turn ones back on islam and to look for commonalities with judaism and christianity so whatever the three agree on would become the new modern religion which would be allowed to be propagated
106000 je kunt beter hier zitten dan in peking neem dat van me aan peking is niet al te schoon eigenlijk een uit de kluiten gewassen dorp hier in hongkong ben je van alle gemakken voorzien ik ben er niet rouwig om dat de paardenevenementen hier worden afgewerkt laat mij maar lekker zitten
106001 alleen in seoel en barcelona heb ik ooit in het olympisch dorp gezeten of je op een paar uur rijden of een paar uur vliegen van de spelen zit wat maakt dat uit we zijn nu eenmaal de buitenbeentjes voor roeiers en zeilers is dat niet anders
106002 er zijn twee redenen waarom de paardendisciplines niet in peking worden gehouden ten eerste heeft peking geen paardencultuur alles moest daar nieuw worden gebouwd bovendien zijn de gezondheidseisen daar nog stringenter dan in hongkong dit is traditioneel verbonden met paarden de renbaan van sha tin waar het hippisch programma plaatsvindt ademt paardensport uit tien miljoen euro omzet op een racedag is hier eerder regel dan uitzondering
106003 een tweede punt is dat er politiek achter zit hongkong heeft van oudsher een aparte status in china de toewijzing van de paardendisciplines is een zoethoudertje van de chinese overheid zo van alsjeblieft hier hebben jullie ook een stukje van de spelen nou ik vind het prima
106004 allemaal overdreven gedoe die voorzorgsmaatregelen die sporters nemen om de reis en het verblijf zo aangenaam mogelijk te verwerken lichttherapie waar hebben we het in godsnaam over wanneer je twee daagjes gaat shoppen in new york doe je dat toch ook niet
106005 nederlanders jammeren nogal vaak je w t toch wat je te wachten staat nou dan moet je je gewoon aanpassen zo moeilijk kan het toch niet zijn
106006 was het tijdens andere spelen zoveel beter in barcelona was het s avonds om negen uur ook nog 38 graden en in athene liep je vier jaar geleden van boom naar boom om vooral maar uit de zon te blijven je moet gewoon even de juiste knoppen indrukken om te wennen daarna kun je gewoon aan de slag
106007 ik ben 58 maar ik ga zeker door tot londen 2012 desnoods als bondscoach van een ander land zolang ik getalenteerde ruiters en goede paarden heb ben ik van de partij er moet alleen wel zicht zijn op een medaille dat is een voorwaarde ik heb geen enkele behoefte om alleen maar mijn zakken te vullen
106008 dit is een bijzondere manier van het eten van ijs
106009 het zorgt ervoor dat de warmte uit het lichaam van de sporter verdwijnt de wetenschap leert ons dat het drinken van deze mix het lichaam koel houdt en bovendien is het veel praktischer dan bijvoorbeeld een koelvest

106012 despite weaknesses in the general economy and credit markets demand for our product continues to be strong as evidenced by the continued double digit growth in our vacation interval sales we are experiencing growth not only in sales to our members but also new customers which further validates our model of vacationing close to home our business strategy during these challenging times will continue to be improving the credit quality of our new sales while preserving liquidity through controlled and measured growth while we are pleased with our continued success we recognize there are still challenges we face during this tumultuous period consequently we are revising our 2008 net income guidance from 28 0 million to a range of approximately 22 0 million to 23 0 million or diluted earnings per share of approximately 0 56 to 0 58 separately our board of directors has authorized a two million share repurchase program which we believe will enhance shareholder value in the long term

106065 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
106066 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza

106221 ive shown i can take that responsibility and if i was made captain i would give even more i dont know where id get that little extra from but id try to find it
106222 but im only 21 right now i just want to win something for arsenal
106223 he is 100 per cent committed and is looking sharp in training there is no problem there
106224 i think that every player who has left arsenal has not shone at his new club
106225 we are not as short of strikers as people thought
106226 in all areas we are still maybe one player short but up front we dont need anybody
106227 technically and football wise they are the best team far beyond manchester united and chelsea
106228 sometimes teams pay a fortune for a player with experience who at key moments can win you a game and thats important
106229 but at arsenal theres a different policy and we have to respect that the day we win something with these players with this policy this atmosphere and style there will be a big change almost a revelation
106230 i speak to people in the game a lot and they tell me about ajax who in the 1970s won the european cup with an extremely young team and changed the face of the game
106231 people tell me that we are on course to do that but we need that stepping stone of winning something of knowing how to win
106232 before the euros i didnt know how it felt to win
106233 but now that i have experienced it i know what it takes you need to have tasted it look at chelsea they hadnt won anything in many years they got experienced players in won the league and that gave them confidence

106235 and believe me i have tried all the self help books out there leslie wainger sol stein stephen king and others but the first truly helpful guidance came from skrywers skryf
106236 if youre passionate about writing a novel all you need is the right tools and a little encouragement
106237 lizet is proof of that our courses get back to the basics of good writing a strong plot intriguing characters dazzling dialogue and original descriptions
106238 nellimmaginario collettivo dice piero angela nel presentare la campagna le giornate con ghiaccio pioggia e neve sono quelle pi rischiose per chi deve guidare in realt la maggior parte dei drammi stradali si consuma in condizioni ambientali ottimali i mesi in cui si perdono pi vite umane sono infatti quelli estivi nel periodo luglio e agosto muoiono sulle strade pi di 1 000 persone la causa principale di questo tremendo eccidio dovuta al cosiddetto fattore umano mancato rispetto delle regole di precedenza guida distratta e velocit elevata da sole provocano quasi il 50 delle tragedie stradali improprio quindi parlare di incidenti come se si trattasse di qualcosa di casuale meglio parlare di incoscienza o di scarso timore di subire sanzioni per comportamenti irresponsabili

106241 we are not as short of strikers as people thought
106242 we have vela who has integrated well into the team and bendtner was a force at the end of last season he will confirm that again this year
106243 in all the areas in total we are perhaps one player short but up front we dont need anybody
106244 i dont know where this rumour comes from but i never had a contact with psg
106245 im aware of the fact they are trying to bounce back to the top level after a very difficult period and i think their recruitment is going on the right track
106246 everybody knows claude makelele and ludo giuly they are exceptional players who proved themselves at the best european clubs
106247 personally i feel great at arsenal at the end of this season i will have a year remaining on my contract and a return to france is at the moment not in the air
106248 it gives me intense pleasure to link up with my team mates i talked about euros with robin van persie something i havent been able to do yet with cesc fabregas who is just back at training but who stayed in london
106249 as far as samir nasri is concerned i think he quickly settled and i think his integration has been made easier by the fact there are a lot of players of his generation within the team and as well many french speaking players
106250 but i dont worry at all in fact he already manages to speak english pretty well
106251 the bond that i feel with pastor hagee and each and every one of you is much stronger than that and so i am proud to stand with you tonight
106252 i dont agree with everything that pastor hagees done and said but there is so much more important than that that we agree on

106256 there are quite a few teams we would like to avoid that is why it is better not to look at it we will just take who we get

106258 just as i can learn from twente twente can learn from me
106259 i have a lot of european experience and that is why i am looking forward to the champions league qualifying round
106260 we are not as short of strikers as people thought
106261 we have vela who has integrated well into the team and bendtner was a force at the end of last season he will confirm that again this year
106262 il sindaco stigmatizza il capogruppo di minoranza giliano bizzarri ha ammesso di aver deciso la rimozione delle immagini sacre su semplice richiesta degli sposi senza prendere minimamente in considerazione le sentenze espresse in merito a tali situazioni che suggeriscono comportamenti opposti a quelli messi in atto dal sindaco
106263 da parte mia si difende il sindaco non credo ci sia stato alcun scempio nei confronti della religione n nei confronti del comune che un luogo pubblico
106264 una coppia si rivolta in municipio per poter celebrare il matrimonio venerd il giorno prima della cerimonia mi stato chiesto per ragioni personali se fosse possibile rimuovere il crocifisso e le immagini sacre a quel punto pi che informarmi se esistevano disposizioni in materia anche da parte della prefettura potevo sono chiedere lumi al segretario comunale cosa che ho fatto la risposta che non c alcun obbligo di tenere il crocifisso nellaula consiliare ma tengo a precisare che la rimozione stata per il solo tempo della durata della cerimonia
106265 quindi secondo me non si tratta di un fatto eclatante abbiamo rispettato la volont di persone che si sono sposate con rito civile e credo che la questione non si ponga peraltro il matrimonio avvenuto in municipio che un luogo pubblico anche di propriet dei residenti in paese e spesso concediamo laula consiliare per determinate cerimonie o manifestazioni senza alcun problema ritengo di aver agito proprio tenendo conto che il municipio il luogo di tutti per eccellenza non una chiesa

106285 we have 25 pre registered bidders already and are planning on accepting only 25 more for a total of 50
106286 since this is our first auction it will be hard to make any accurate projections as to what the winning bid will be
106287 however based on gut instinct and feedback received from clients i believe 70 of the inventory will go in the mid 2 cpm range 20 will go in the upper 1 cpm range and 10 you will be able to steal for the minimum bid really though your guess is as good as mine we will let the clients control the marketplace that is what an auction is all about
106288 for you youngsters out there the auction will not be on ebay or on the internet

106298 i had actually just shot a pilot with fellow regular cassidy freeman and they didnt pick it up i think it was a day or two later that i got the call from smallville we talked a lot and i love playing the character i have a lot of faith in the writers that they will write great stuff for me
106299 clark and oliver are buddies and friends in the premiere
106300 its actually why oliver is coming to back to look for clark but oliver gets broken down a little bit he starts to look at all the things he sacrificed to do what he does and he starts to wonder if it was worth it its kind of cool and i think everybody does that but once you start to question something and your heart is not in it then it becomes really dangerous to keep doing it because you are vulnerable and susceptible its like the football players that say if youre not going to play 100 percent you are going to get hurt oliver starts to question if its worth it anymore and clark starts to embrace his destiny a little bit more its interesting because the guy thats worn the suit is going the other way and the guy who has never worn the suit is going that way
106301 were going to go back into the smallville mythology and explore how oliver became the green arrow why he is the green arrow and how he became so good at archery
106302 it was talked about in previous seasons so it is in the realm of possibility
106303 that isnt the feel of our show and isnt the characters that people have gotten to know on our show
106304 i think as they work together you see the tension and the sparks fly which is really fun but its all born out of the same clark kent that we know and the same lois that we know on our show so there is not a change in tone on the show in any way
106305 we definitely have an episode this year that addresses a lot of the underlying tension the sexual tension the love tension between the two of them so we do definitely touch on it this year
106306 she will look different visually it will not be the lana lang that were used to seeing
106307 shes grown up shes left smallville and shes going to come back a woman obviously she was a woman since she got married but shes still a kid she was living in the same town her whole life this is her chance to come back with a stronger point of view than she ever has
106308 were going to go back into the smallville mythology a little bit and kind of explore how oliver became the green arrow why is he the green arrow and how he became so good at archery and that kind of stuff
106309 he starts to look at all of the things that hes sacrificed to do what he does and he starts to wonder whether or not it was worth it which is kind of cool i think everybody does that but i think once you do that once you start to question something and your hearts not in it it becomes really dangerous to keep doing it because youre vulnerable youre susceptible as he starts to question whether or not its worth it anymore clark is starting to embrace his destiny a little bit more its interesting because the guy that wore the suit is going the other way and the guy thats never even put the suit on is going the other way we start to butt heads a little bit so its going to be a lot of fun

106368 didnt like it the first film was part of this obsession with cutting and commercial editing and it doesnt make for good filmmaking but i really liked kairo and thought that was truly haunting and disturbing there are certain shots in it that it will stay with me forever i told joel and producer mike leahy that it was one of the reasons why i took the job i havent seen our movie yet but im told were taking it back to the original film
106369 ive never seen a film that was shot that way that was meant for reality
106370 it was a way ironically of saving money we wouldnt have to move the production to build sets or move locations and it was a real challenge because nothing is there and the world is not there it was hard
106371 i think they thought of me as an actor who is used to working on green screen which i kindve am but on battlestar galactica the green screen is just a backdrop even when were in a viper flying were in a cockpit and were pretending to fly and everything the hangar deck exists we replicate it to give it depth and the green screen is a backdrop on this everything was green it was like we were acting in a vacuum
106372 if the film looks right it might be a way for the film producers to get away with it john adams recently green screened versailles into the foreground of an episode thats an expensive set to build if you can do it on a green screen then the technology is cheaper to do it than the reality the opposite used to be true but for an actor you dont get genuine behavior because we react off of certain situations unless you do the research and go to the place you need to
106373 shes like a little jodie foster whos a child first and an actor second shes an instinctive actress because she doesnt have to become this strange hybrid individual shes just a kid shes very talented and for her sake im glad it was green screen because then she didnt have to confront the reality of what we were doing too much
106374 its widely recognised that when people get information overload they switch off and reject any advice theyre given people need space to calculate their financial commitments assess their priorities and come to their own conclusions
106375 its all very well lenders issuing reports about the saving patterns of consumers and urging them to take out some form of payment protection but if their premiums are sky high these products will be out of the reach of many people more reports confirming what we already know and then offering an unaffordable solution is not helping
106376 everyone wants to sell their products but i care more about people who are vulnerable who do not have huge salaries or savings to fall back on and are more likely to suffer financially this is why my products are cheaper so those who need them most can afford them

106395 there is an abundant market for industrial nanotechs nansulate energy saving coating products in nigeria
106396 with our extensive experience in marketing and promoting international products in nigeria and west africa henriboss will make nansulate products a household name in this region
106397 we had received several inquiries and interest in distributorship for the country of nigeria
106398 after a thorough and extensive review of all candidates we chose henriboss global located in abuja nigeria with offices in owerri imo state and brussels belgium
106399 market penetration for the nansulate product line is much faster in international markets when represented by local knowledgeable companies such as henriboss
106400 nigeria is an important player in the energy industry which makes the region very interesting to us our well established strategy of creating a global sales and distribution platform now has the companys products represented in over 30 countries around the world and has provided protection for the companys revenue stream growth rate from regional economic downturns
106401 this has been a transformational year with the successful sale of ufindus for 20m and the development of our complex managed hosting business using our own network of carrier neutral datacentres we are now well positioned to address our chosen market with the firepower to make strategic acquisitions in combination with our organic growth
106402 our focus on the data centre offering is paying off and were in a great position to win more high margin corporate business a complete one source managed hosting service is very different to whats on offer from other providers ie space and power only which puts us in a very strong position in the market
106403 weve equipped our four data centre s with the latest technology and ensured that we have ample power to cope with expected future computing demands we suffer none of the legacy problems that face many of todays operators and this coupled with a decade of hosting expertise has been a significant selling point for us this has been demonstrated by the group winning its largest single contract worth 5 75m over 5 years with bt
106404 we recognise that we have a corporate social and commercial responsibility to achieve the most efficient data centre s that we can and we will constantly seek to reduce our environmental impact where possible
106405 with the sale of ufindus we find ourselves in the enviable position of having sufficient funding to fully underwrite our current business plans without having to place reliance on borrowing facilities at this testing time in the credit market we will be exploring a number of acquisition opportunities during the next year which will enable us to add revenues skills and savings to the group

106426 i thought i was going to be an academic teaching philosophy in a university
106427 but as a doctoral student it became clear that i didnt have the personality for the academic life i was more attracted to the real than the theoretical i left the program and went into sales and whats more real than selling now almost thirty years later im back where i started teaching combining my love of working with and training salespeople and managers with the hard lessons ive learned over the years in the sales business

106436 tackling the power of the retail landlords should be an important part of any reform recommended by the accc
106437 franklins superbarn and aldi rarely get a look in shopping centres go straight for the big two
106438 whats more smaller chains are prevented from opening down the road because of centres policy planning laws that concentrate major shopping centres in select areas banning or limiting competitors in surrounding suburbs
106439 i believe that the biggest gains would come from looking at planning laws and their impact on competition tough federal and state action will be crucial if anything is to be done
106440 hes like one of those wounded animals on three legs you feel very sorry for him but you know what needs to be done
106441 of course patients really appreciate this simple topical method vs taking systemic oral antibiotics
106442 one important factor here is that the medications come in a sealed vial the patient just pops the top and squeezes out its contents this is vital for many medications that are unstable and removes the need for preservatives note that we add amphotericin b to saline this is fine as long as the mix is used right away before it precipitates

106457 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
106458 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
106459 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
106460 according to initial estimates there have been more than 260 civilian casualties in july of this year higher than any other month in the past six years
106461 the increased number of air strikes by international military forces which are up by approximately 40 per cent on last year has also contributed to the rising civilian death toll

106474 the massive rise in energy and food prices is robbing households of their purchasing power

106476 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
106477 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools

106488 si e secondo me nettamente favorito per lo scudetto ha giocatori di esperienza un bonera in grande crescita e poi arrivato ronaldinho vedrete che gi dalle prime gare il brasiliano far la differenza sar uno spettacolo per i nostri occhi su una cosa il milan deve per essere da subito chiaro la gerarchia dei suoi tre portieri va stabilita immediatamente altrimenti rischia di trascinarsi fino a gennaio con questo dilemma
106489 il neo tecnico interista scoprir presto la differenza tra il nostro campionato e quello inglese non ho assolutamente nulla contro di lui ma in italia di allenatori come lex allenatore del chelsea non ne mancano ancelotti lippi spalletti non hanno niente da invidiare al tecnico portoghese penso che in italia non avr lo stesso impatto che ha avuto in inghilterra e potr fare pi fatica su una cosa non ho dubbi sicuramente un grande educatore e potrebbe diventare nel nostro paese un ottimo riferimento culturale
106490 il brasiliano ex palermo un grande giocatore ha colpi da fuoriclasse ma la juve ha anche trezeguet e difficilmente li vedremo in campo assieme non avrei mai acquistato invece il danese poulsen un giocatore scorrettissimo e diseducativo al massimo per me lui lanticalcio non dimentichiamoci certi episodi da lui commessi lepisodio dello sputo di totti gli scontri con gattuso e kaka ma anche un suo gesto di reazione in svezia danimarca che pochi ricordano comunque aspetto il giocatore per ricredermi ma rimango della mia idea
106491 se fosse arrivato il fuoriclasse rumeno la roma sarebbe stata la squadra da battere ma cos le manca qualcosa aquilani inoltre non lo reputo un giocatore decisivo e davanti ad unofferta importante non ci penserei due volte a cederlo
106492 corvino come sempre ha lavorato bene jovetic giovanissimo ma un ottimo giocatore mentre gilardino secondo me ha fatto benissimo a chiudere il ciclo al milan a firenze ha ritrovato mutu e mister prandelli pertanto credo che realizzer almeno 15 reti
106493 anche marino ha lavorato come suo solito del bomber denis ne parlano davvero bene mentre hamsik non lo scopro di certo io e impressionante invece il calore dei napoletani sessantamila spettatori per una gara di intertoto sono un autentico spot al calcio
106494 il mister lo sento quasi quotidianamente e devo dire che carico come una molla non vede lora di ripartire per questa ennesima avventura punteller la squadra e non perder in esperienza pertanto continuer con i suoi punti fermi buffon cannavaro pirlo e seguir i nuovi giovani che si metteranno in luce il volto nuovo per lazzurro sar lex parmense cigarini latalanta ha davvero fatto un colpaccio con il suo acquisto cassano per me il pi forte in circolazione per lui ci deve essere sempre spazio agli ultimi europei non ha fatto la differenza ma se per questo tutta la nazionale non ha entusiasmato totti lippi lo segue magari non lo chiamer per le gare di qualificazione ma se in forma e sta bene deve giocare per i mondiali 2010 in condizioni ottimali non pu mancare
106495 balotelli avrebbe fatto bene a farsi un anno in prestito da qualche parte per poi rientrare allinter ancora pi forte paloschi sullo stesso livello di supermario ma forse pi potente e forte di testa sfondera di sicuro permettimi una considerazione su alessio cerci appena passato allatalanta via roma mi sarebbe piaciuto vederlo subito con i giallorossi soprattutto dopo la cessione di mancini piuttosto che accostare certi nomi ai capitolini afellay elano menez molto meglio puntare sul giovane di valmontone che arriva da una splendida stagione a pisa

106502 the nanobialys contain manganese instead of gadolinium manganese is an element found naturally in the body in addition the manganese in the nanobialys is tied up so it stays with the particles making them very safe
106503 when we looked at the particles with an electron microscope we saw they are round and flat with a dimple in the centre like red blood cells but also a little irregular like bagels i came across the word bialy which is a polish roll like a bagel without a hole that can be made with different toppings so i called the particles nanobialys

106506 we believe that our christian faith is a continuous perpetuation of a major miracle the new birth it is a vital and unique work of god in human nature it is not reasoning yourself into a position but something happening that cannot be explained for what happens to a christian can never be explained by a psychologist in that great and terrible day there will be those white with shock when they find that they depended on a mental assent to christianity instead of on a miracle of new birth

106791 this investigation is in response to concerns raised by a small number of staff
106792 we have identified around 25 people and they are a myriad of different cancer types
106793 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers
106794 we really felt that if staff are concerned about it the only way to address those concerns was to retain some consultants and conduct a proper and thorough investigation so we can give them a high level of comfort that there isnt a problem
106795 i dont believe there really is a cluster here at all but we need to take it seriously

106808 woolworths understands that there is genuine hardship across the transport industry
106809 woolworths pays appropriate national fuel levies to all its transport providers
106810 it is our expectation and our transport providers responsibility that these fuel levies are passed on to any drivers who are subcontracted by our direct transport providers
106811 as a company that depends on transport woolworths accepts that higher fuel prices are a fact of life
106812 all sectors of the logistics industry must work together to ensure that we can meet the challenges ahead rather than unfairly placing blame on selected participants
106813 we maintain the big transport clients who are the ones contracting the drivers to do their work they are basically holding out on paying these drivers a fair rate of pay

106838 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
106839 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
106840 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
106841 the scales automatically recognize which fruit or vegetables are to be weighed and ask the customer to choose between only those icons that are relevant such as tomatoes vine ripened tomatoes and beefsteak tomatoes

106883 many of the palestinian kids parents are refugees or internal refugees in israel whose own parents were uprooted many of the jewish kids grandparents are holocaust survivors they are dealing with a lot of personal and family stories that relate to the conflict

106900 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
106901 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
106902 there was no rage in him and he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
106903 he was taunting police with the head in his hand out the window
106904 we have word from people on the scene that when the killer was alone with the body

106913 i love how palestinians and jews hate each other its so cute honestly whats the difference theyre brown they have an odour its like sweet potatoes hating yam
106914 the quartet including britain should try to engage with moderate elements within hamas especially in view of the current gaza ceasefire
106915 some of israels actions against the palestinians have been disproportionate and we conclude that israeli policies towards the population of the gaza strip have been collective punishment
106916 but there cannot be a credible peace deal without involving hamas
106917 israel has proved in the past that it is more than willing to talk with enemies who want peace and are willing to accept israels right to exist
106918 however this is not the case with hamas which is determined to stay irrelevant by not accepting even one of the principles set by the international community hamas actions speak louder than words and hamas has proved it is no partner for dialogue
106919 hamas is part of the problem and not part of the solution

106921 haaretz was against the occupation before amira hass and meron rappaport
106922 the paper is no less committed to ending the occupation but there was a feeling that the paper needed to be a lighter more attractive read
106923 she said it was her first time in israel but she had seen pictures from her husbands trips she really likes the weather she definitely saw how close a group we were it was the best three weeks of my life
106924 were very angry and bitterly disappointed at the judgment though not surprised we had hoped it would be the end of the road for us today but it was not to be
106925 i think the law lords came to this appeal with a view and they decided our case did not fit that view they are perfectly entitled to that but they should have taken more account of our case
106926 there is also the legal position of witnesses there is no special relationship any witness is at risk if they are threatened and the police have absolute immunity if anything happens to them that simply cannot be right
106927 we taught giles to be an upright citizen but if someone asked me now i would say dont bother who is going to come forward after this

106932 we never wanted to kill innocent civilians and children it happened by bad luck
106933 i started with my mp in 1995 and i went to so many ministers nobody wanted to know it wasnt a matter of cosmic importance it affects a few hundred refugees although it was a total injustice
106934 those who went to school university or yeshivah and started work after 1948 got the full pension
106935 but those without a family or rich uncle to pay for them to go to school and university had to start work if a boy or girl started work in 1940 they would get only a ninth of the pension instead of getting something like 300 a month some would be getting 40 a month
106936 many of them lost members of their family in the holocaust they survived because they were sent to britain as children they stayed and worked here a legal restriction has prevented them claiming the money due to them from the german government after detailed negotiations over several months with the german government we have now found a way forward
106937 if the uk contributions could be struck off the record they the german government said they would pay
106938 we are confident that she will build on the achievements of her predecessor
106939 before the fight i dont like to talk a lot of crap about my opponents its nothing personal when it comes to interviews or anything like that
106940 but once i get in there i make it personal this is my livelihood my life is either going to go up or go down depending on what happens right here so its really personal i make that guy my enemy
106941 hes going to get in there and hes going to try to take something from me
106942 not only my reputation my pride but hes going to try to knock my expletive in the dirt
106943 ive got nothing but respect for the guys i compete against but in the cage its a different story
106944 hes a pretty tough striker hes got some good judo throws and his grappling is pretty tough hes good at staying out of submissions
106945 the big thing in my mind is hes real tough hes resilient as is common for a lot of the japanese fighters they go for it and its hard to stop them they never quit
106946 i think its going to make for an exciting fight i think hes going to stand with me which is something ive been hoping for a while
106947 i dont know if thats a good decision on his part
106948 after six years of successful trading and rapid growth we ran into a problem in may when our bankers hsbc announced without warning that they were concerned about the potential chargeback risk if wrapit was unable to fulfil its obligations to guests to deliver the gifts purchased their solution was to sequester all our credit and visa debit card revenue into a separate account to provide them with added security this meant that we were unable to pay suppliers and sometimes resulted in late delivery of gifts
106949 our duty of confidentiality precludes us from providing any details of wrapits financial circumstances however hsbc is a responsible lender and believes it is doing all it can to assist the directors we now await the outcome of the companys discussions with their advisers and very much hope that wrapit can continue trading
106950 there is the distinct possibility that if the company goes under we will not get any of them
106951 it is very uncomfortable and unpleasant to have to ask people who have been overly generous
106952 the most embarrassing part of this is you have to speak to your guests what do you say to people do you say send me the money or can you buy the gift again
106953 time to get a move on time to get back on the road
106954 hey baby you brought me coffee you get groovier every day
106955 now that hes with us i dont know but somehow we did didnt we baby it may not have always been graceful and smooth but we made it together
106956 yeah i guess you could say we pretty much did
106957 you know it after the film well request your new birth certificate and go from there
106958 you realize youll only have my beat up old black truck to drive around

106964 pose aussi des questions auxquelles il faut que nous r pondions
106965 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
106966 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
106967 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
106968 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
106969 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
106970 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
106971 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
106972 without a doubt the humanitarian challenge in afghanistan continues to grow insurgent and criminal attacks have prevented us from reaching some the countrys most vulnerable communities
106973 it will just be good to see this group thrive
106974 weve worked hard at it weve made some great strides it would be good to get that confirmation that we have made progress tomorrow night
106975 but if were sitting here tomorrow night having come second then youll probably suggest that weve made no progress whatsoever
106976 the sheer weight of numbers 1986 its an indicator of what it takes and obviously what weve brought in the past hasnt been enough and were conscious of that but really keen about that as well
106977 you hate missing any games but certainly i was really buoyed by the way the team played last week
106978 in sport you tend to find that those sort of hoodoos or a string of matches either won or lost but they always get broken eventually
106979 i suspect this weekend could be a grind it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama
106980 we monitor and manage our weeks according to our state and i think these guys are probably in better shape now for this challenge than they would have been in week one or week two
106981 these guys will be up for this theyve got a challenge its very clear how significant that challenge is its obvious for all to see but theyre excited
106982 theyre standing at the foot of the hill and theyre ready to climb theyre just waiting for the whistle
106983 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
106984 we understand that bocog will give details to the media very soon of how the matter has been addressed we trust them to keep their promise
106985 ive heard that the issue has been resolved and i am very happy about that promises were made about a free internet and we are glad to hear that they are going to be respected
106986 the selectors felt that michael crocker and danny buderus werent deserting rugby league in australia
106987 they felt theyve given absolutely great service to rugby league here and they just got to that stage in their career where theyre going to move so they can lengthen it a little
106988 so they felt under those circumstances where theyve given great service they should be rewarded by being considered for this
106989 i dont pick the team ive made an opinion about what i feel is a leagues decision in regards to players going to england
106990 the form of danny buderus and michael crocker warrants their selection in this squad and if they continue on that form theyll warrant selection in regards to the world cup
106991 it todays squad is a great purpose of showing the players that we are very happy with in regards to playing in the world cup and being involved in that australian team
106992 and also for the players that havent been picked and think they should be there its a great opportunity to show over the next six weeks plus semi finals that they have the form to warrant a position in the team
106993 they the files regarding salaries were on that infamous file server computer that was taken to london
106994 were obviously looking at all options because that would mean if we maintain our present policy with stadia we would have a very crowded mcg and telstra dome
106995 we cant play any more games at skilled stadium so one option obviously is to play as many games at telstra dome and the mcg or to have a look at another option which could be a boutique stadium
106996 obviously one option is a boutique stadium that might hold 26 to 28 games with a capacity of 25 000 people
106997 were just doing the work now we discussed it with the club ceos at a conference we had yesterday and the day before
106998 we basically said to them that we understand that the stadium economics isnt working for the clubs in melbourne that we need to try and get a better return out of the mcg and telstra dome for them
106999 and down the track if and when we introduce the two teams in 2011 and 2012 there could be if we go to 24 rounds an extra 40 games and about 26 or 28 of those could be in melbourne
107000 they certainly want to be there at the table if and when we decide we might go further or there might be a victorian club thats interested in relocating
107001 we think its terribly important that tasmania puts their bid in
107002 i think tasmania could play an integral role in our national competition and theyve got a rich history of football theyre very decent people theyve served us very well with the relationship with hawthorn theyve invested in york park in launceston
107003 at a point in time why not what happens down the track with tasmania thats up for grabs and its all the more reason why they should be getting their bid together
107004 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
107005 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
107006 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity he said
107007 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
107008 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
107009 id be happy with a win against afghanistan at the moment let alone a top four team
107010 ive even been playing on the playstation getting wins on that at the moment
107011 obviously lukes got seven weeks of energy to use and we need him to go out and concentrate on his game and not get caught up any incidents that can take away from his performance
107012 hes an outstanding player and he brings a lot to us in terms of his go forward and as a defender
107013 hes just a guy who inspires other players and he will make them feel comfortable
107014 but we need for him not to get caught up in any outside influences
107015 the thing about ash hes got great footwork and hes a player who can chime in and cause some doubts
107016 carl played really strong last week got run under his belt and im not sure hes a play you want to take on
107017 his go forward was exceptional his minutes were good and hell give us some stability around the rucks and some authority with luke that weve probably been lacking
107018 they score a lot of tries from kicks they very good at that
107019 theyve got state of origin halves and theyre a quality team
107020 his progress is fantastic but he wont be back until the titans game in two weeks
107021 we havent given up hope of winning games or getting off the bottom
107022 we know we cant make the playoffs but we can make it interesting for some teams
107023 the guys who are in the team at the moment the young guys rob eddy and clinton jones have been doing a fantastic job and its not going to be easy trying to push back into the side because those guys are doing their jobs
107024 im just going to go out there and do the best i can for casey and hopefully i can find my way back into the side
107025 my training has been pretty solid over the last six weeks i feel really confident of coming back and playing good footy
107026 he was disappointed with his game at the weekend it was his first game back for a while and maybe bigger blokes take a while to get their touch back
107027 he was very disappointed but hell go back hes got a great attitude his bodys as good as its ever been hes really enjoying his footy again and i still think hes got a big part to play
107028 hes trained harder and hes done more running than hes ever done since hes had his hand injury
107029 who knows what can happen we might get a few injuries and he might come in and get that fairytale finish
107030 something that we havent had in my time with the club is a genuine out and out playmaker who can create opportunities and its good to have that string to our bow now
107031 apart from charlies ability on the park i think his experience off it was the thing that attracted me
107032 im 32 and i still want to win myself i like to win trophies and i think weve got a great bunch of boys here
107033 hopefully ill enjoy my football and have a laugh on the field
107034 but im here to be serious and win trophies no doubt about it
107035 i am asking on their behalf i am not asking on behalf of the world but on behalf of those whom you gave me
107036 not one of them was lost except the one destined to be lost so that the scripture might be fulfilled
107037 weve had to go to bat for fluoride periodically over the time that ive been here
107038 it can be an extremely contentious issue about two years ago we made a presentation to support it and i dont see any reason to change that
107039 the bottom line is that weve achieved the levels theyre recommending for many years
107040 its been 10 years at least even at maximum levels there are unlikely to be adverse effects
107041 i dont make these decisions by myself its part of a weight of evidence that comes from national and international public health agencies
107042 if we take it out of the water were still going to have it in the toothpaste
107043 this is the most divisive issue that will ever hit sarnia there was really a lot of fear mongering going on
107044 you have to look at the overwhelming weight of evidence thats what has been done again nationally and there isnt any new evidence that supports claims of bone problems cancer problems or developmental problems
107045 each successive birth cohort is going to be smaller when younger cohorts get smaller you have fewer females its a double whammy
107046 the pope is going to rescind the special indult that allowed people a different way to receive communion from that which is normative
107047 water fluoridation is one possible intervention to improve dental health but there is a lot to consider we will reflect on the evidence from the joint committee in the light of our oral health strategy and decide whether we wish to consider the matter further
107048 primary care trusts pcts across the north west are considering the potential for fluoridation of public water supplies as part of our overall strategies to improve the oral health of the populations we serve
107049 the north west strategic health authority sha has asked nhs blackburn with darwen to indicate whether or not we wish this possibility to be explored
107050 the pct board is expected to consider this issue in september and will then indicate to the sha whether or not we wish it to develop full proposals for a scheme which would enable water supplies to the population of blackburn with darwen to be fluoridated

107162 are we capturing killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting training and deploying against us
107163 irregular warfare is far more intellectual than a bayonet charge
107164 the more force you use the less effective it is
107165 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies

107239 its such a good version and it really deserves better sales i know its getting pirated to hell and back it was up on torrents literally the day it shipped
107240 i certainly have pushed for digital distribution on the title but capcom japan so far has not allowed it
107241 for the record all capcom entertainment developed titles will be distributed extremely widely via digital channels not just steam or direct2drive but more than a dozen partners across more than 100 sites portals for everything we do
107242 ive spent the last year building up that channel and im continuing to add partners even in advance of age of booty motogp neopets dark void and flock shipping
107243 i have a presentation im making shortly that im hoping will make that approach something we do with all of our pc content even those developed in japan but no promises it might not happen
107244 in this industry you have to have reliable up to date daily news and information gamesindustry biz is by far the best source for the games industry its grown in stature over the years and really is the pre eminent site its a highly effective way to market to the trade i recommend it highly
107245 we reject it no one has given any evidence to us its just an allegation

107259 is there a difference of emphasis it certainly looks as though there is
107260 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
107261 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
107262 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
107263 im fearful that my outings put my season in jeopardy
107264 i just thought it was something i was going to have to deal with as i get older
107265 i got carried away it wasnt intentional i was excited it was a big spot for us
107266 i think hes been a good presence in the bullpen and with him at the back end the ninth inning guys know their roles
107267 youve got the no 9 hitter and youve got grady sizemore on deck and you throw a 3 2 breaking ball that is not acceptable
107268 on a 3 2 count in that situation you know the guy is looking for a fastball i should have gone ahead and thrown it thats the way i normally pitch here it is hit it
107269 the pitch i was more upset about was the pitch when i hit fasano i had two strikes on him it kind of went downhill from there
107270 you cant get too upset at yourself for stuff like that
107271 but the stuff leading up to it is what you get upset about the hit batter and the walk
107272 if grady comes up and does that with nobody on its not that big of a deal
107273 i feel like i let one slip away a little bit
107274 i feel like i had some pretty good stuff my command wasnt as good as i would have liked but i had plenty of situations where if i make some pitches i can get myself out of some jams or not even create the jams i got into
107275 every place i went i was listening to the radio to know who was going to be the new coach at michigan state
107276 george had indicated that he was going to hire me
107277 that was really disappointing for me because i was excited about coaching for him and coaching at michigan state
107278 i told george you know id love to coach with you but i cant do that
107279 if you look on the web site im no 5
107280 i looked at the depth chart i peeked at it one time just to see
107281 i know that thats obvious im the guy in the preseason game who comes in when all the vets got their reps and i try to show out i try to get 100 yards
107282 if he asks me to go out with the 10th team im going to go out there whenever he calls my number i just want to go out there and do the right thing
107283 i was the air it out champion every year at receiver
107284 ive got a little something i wouldnt be surprised if sooner or later in my career im at the slot position
107285 running post routes if reggie bush can do it i can do it im just saying im not scared we have post routes at the running back position were just not that far in the playbook but i can do it i can do it
107286 i even threw a halfback pass for a touchdown in college
107287 think about how i got to the nfl think about how i got to the position im in now i was undrafted man ive been cut three times
107288 do you think theres something that is going to deter me one bit i wouldnt be where i am if i was like that i just keep moving forward
107289 thats why im in the nfl man because i scrap
107290 i wouldnt be here if i didnt scrap if i didnt scrap id be working a job somewhere
107291 now if the coaches decide to do something else as a player i just adjust and play im a player theyre the coaches they make the decisions all i do is come out here and work hard and compete every day
107292 weve done it all year long you cant win doing that you just cant do it
107293 anytime you have that as an addition absolutely it helps your bullpen but it doesnt help anybody else if people are walking people he has no bearing on that whatsoever
107294 and i dont think that we were ever close we had a couple things where we were talking and going back and forth but it wasnt close theres a lot of big things that have been going on and when you have those type things out there a lot of times it clogs other things going on and people are focused towards those we werent involved in those
107295 if theyre in a position where theyre looking to trade guys that are quality guys they know that even if theyre free agents theyre going to get a couple draft choices for them youve got to equalize that i understand that
107296 ill be glad to get kyle here get him with our ballclub friday and stabilize our bullpen a little bit more
107297 but like ive said all along we have to play well if were going to win we have to play well we have to play well on a consistent basis weve addressed our bullpen
107298 anytime you make moves you can make 10 of them you always have an area thats your weakest part that never changes basically we have to be in a position where some of our guys have to step up and do well for us thats how it is i know we have the potential to do it but we have to play well if youre a couple games over 500 its not going to be good enough to get it done
107299 we need to recognize at the outset that what we do to animals from their perspective certainly and probably from ours is morally wrong and unacceptable
107300 where is the big encouragement where is the political will where is the funding for this kind of research and where are the prizes
107301 why is animal alternative work never recognized in the nobel prize for medicine for example
107302 hes got a long way to go lots of surgery hell need prosthesis
107303 but its kind of a hike to get to it and there is no supervision there
107304 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
107305 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
107306 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
107307 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
107308 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
107309 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
107310 hes a heavy drinker and sometimes when he drinks he changes and gets real nasty
107311 i dont know if he swallowed it or if my dogs might have eaten it i dont know
107312 i am unable to conclude that the punch thrown by jamie gregory meets the objective standards of the ordinary man
107313 his response was not proportional and did not comply with the standard of self control and restraint that is expected from all members of our society
107314 i do not believe there is anyone who does not know that i am in the detention unit
107315 i must say that this is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence here i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach me here
107316 the man is standing trial for war crimes he has an opportunity to defend himself in the hague that is not an opportunity that was afforded to any of his victims
107317 those are lies i do not comment on any longer
107318 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
107319 will insist on that even if he has to go on hunger strike
107320 i am not interested in having someone else read the indictment to me
107321 i would rather receive the new indictment that has been announced and have sufficient time to study it and then have my initial appearance for that and enter my plea
107322 its the beast i did not believe it until now
107323 this whale was very frail and old looking and its teeth were ground down quite low so it could have been an old animal that came in to die
107324 this is a government that has come to the end of its road
107325 the right thing to do when the prime minister goes is to let the people choose who will lead them
107326 i believe we will have elections in february or march and until then olmert will be prime minister
107327 but he has never been in a jam like this
107328 not only can this behaviour be dangerous but it is causing misery and distress for the restaurant patrons and staff and the nearby residents
107329 letters have been sent to the registered owners of the vehicles as it is their names which show up on the police national computer

107348 insiders say hillary was never on obamas vp list obama felt it would have been too much to put her on the ticket bad enough to worry about jesse cutting them off didnt want to worry about hillary breaking them too you know what im saying
107349 mccain is not backing down hes defending the commercial where he compared barack obama to paris hilton as being all talk and little action thats what he said like paris barack obama is all talk and little action really has he seen her sex video there is no talk it is all action
107350 demeaning obama is not why this is a dick move by mccain
107351 the national enquirer caught former presidential candidate john edwards sneaking out of his girlfriends room at the 2 40 in the morning see edwards got caught because the reporters were there waiting for him they were in the hotel waiting for him they knew he would be there see if edwards didnt want to get caught he should have met this woman at the hotel where john mccain was staying there are no reporters
107352 the national enquirer claimed they caught john edwards visiting his mistress at 2 40 in the morning at the beverly hills hotel monday night and when a team of reporters confronted him he ran and hid in the mens room and you know who was in there senator larry craig what are the odds
107353 barack obama gave a speech in germany and 200 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
107354 while barack obama was campaigning in germany he spoke to a half million people in germany a half million people and while he was doing that john mccain he wasnt laying around no no john mccain was out driving in his driveway and he backed over the mailbox
107355 and according to the tv show extra former vice president join the cast of dancing with the stars thats true dan quayle you remember he was vice president under the first george bush see that was back in the day when the president was smart and the vice president was an idiot now of course everythings turned around
107356 im not the only one who noticed the press bias against john mccain so has john mccain last week his campaign sent an e mail to reporters saying its pretty obvious that the media has a bizarre fascination with barack obama some may even say its a love affair this has got to be hard on mccain it is tough seeing your old flame with someone new john mccain and the media had a very hot fling back in the summer of 2000 they even had cute little nicknames for each other the press called mccain maverick and mccain called the press any time he wanted favorable coverage
107357 nation ive got great news i am furious today alaska senator ted stevens was unfairly indicted by the justice department just because the oilfield company veco didnt charge him for an extensive renovation on his house including a brand new first floor a fully finished basement a wrap around deck and one assumes installing the latest internet tubes on screen stevens talking about the internet not being a big truck but a series of tubes the justice department is calling this a conflict of interest please veco is a major oil drilling company and senator stevens worked tirelessly to allow drilling in anwr thats not a conflict of interest their interests line up perfectly this is a non story folks and i look forward to stevens being proven innocent when president bush commutes his sentence
107358 barack obama just back from his overseas trip thats what everyones talking about barack obamas upset did you hear about this hes angry cause the other day in israel someone revealed the contents of a private prayer that obama inserted into jerusalems western wall its supposed to be private and someone opened it up and revealed it yeah experts say its even worse than the time the washington post printed president bushs letter to santa
107359 1191 behind him i thought it was his birth date
107360 vice president dick cheney is in baghdad while he was in iraq he said that its a successful endeavor at least i think thats what he said it was hard to hear over the explosions
107361 john mccain and barack obama have both laid out their energy plans obama wants enough green energy to power the entire u s economy and mccain just wants enough power to keep his energy friends in the green
107362 so my supervisor asked me to let you know that since youre doing so well youll be graduating from hospice in two weeks were sorry but we have to discharge you from our service
107363 i had no idea that was gonna happen do i really have to be discharged
107364 well based on the relatively strict guidelines im afraid so your breathing is better your kidney function has improved your appetite is steady youve gained ten pounds and youre getting out of the house almost every day medicare has very strict criteria for being on hospice and you no longer meet the criteria i know its scary
107365 but you have your family nearby and your doctor agrees that youre doing amazingly well
107366 my doctor is wonderful and you have all been so helpful but couldnt i still have a visiting nurse once a week or so
107367 we would love to supply you with a non hospice visiting nurse but you dont meet medicares homebound criteria and since you go out almost every day and its not physically a burden to do so medicare says you dont need a visiting nurse its a lot of bureaucracy really but our hands are tied
107368 but if my son and i need help with medications or anything like that no one at the doctors office will really take the time to help us theyre just too busy i need someone to sit with me at my kitchen table and sort it all out
107369 thats a problem many people have and the government doesnt feel we should be able to help you with that if youre able to get out of the house and to the doctors office if you still feel you need help and dont qualify as homebound you have to hire a private duty nurse which we know can be an expense that many people cant afford
107370 i could be even sicker than i was before and getting ready to die i guess a lot of people would be thrilled to graduate from hospice
107371 yeah some people just turn it around and were amazed at how well they do and youre one of those people
107372 and while were sorry that were forced to discharge you were also happy that youre doing so well and we feel ok about it because you have such a supportive family
107373 youre right im lucky and blessed i appreciate everything you people have done ill be ok the doctors right up the street my son comes almost every day and this dog is my really best friend
107374 well your regular nurse will be back out to see you one more time next week if anything comes up before then just give us a call it was a pleasure meeting you and im sorry i had to be the one to give you the news
107375 youre doing your job and telling me like it is i know ill be ok and when i need you again my doctor can refer me
107376 ce genre de certitude narrive quune seule fois dans une vie
107377 i really was blown away by the depth of your writing do you write for a living if not why not count me among your fans

107403 concentrate on my voice help is coming do not worry just listen to me block his voice out
107404 come with me and i will leave the brat alone
107405 i know you are hungry let me help you i made sure to feed for you
107406 you turned her against her will even a mate has to agree
107407 we are connected youve seen how she reacts to my voice i know you were watching
107408 youre starved i do not think kami will be providing for you tonight i will do so after i attend kyle he needs fresh blood for his leg to heal properly wait in your room for me it will not take long
107409 i had ken make sure kyle was properly fed that way i would have enough for you
107410 i will save you the trouble you have been through enough this night
107411 rest now we will have new clothing for you tomorrow i am sorry that heathen ripped it i know how much you loved it
107412 darien said he was going to be gone before you got there
107413 he said none of us will be the ones to kill him
107414 it would not surprise me if was his own coven
107415 these dresses do not come cheep try not to rip this one next time
107416 im going to go see what darien is up too
107417 kami came to me the other night not too long after he explained about those books he said you too interest in our kind and love
107418 i know you are dying to know about us and our mates like how you react when you are around garith for instance
107419 i wish i could have punched the jerk he did that on purpose
107420 kamigishi seemed troubled by it too at first he was going to charge garith to get him off then you kissed back
107421 there was nothing you could have really done about it he used blood to coax you when you were nearly starved garith knew kami was watching
107422 it is depressing to say that the males of our kind can have multiple mates i actually am an acquaintance to a gentleman who had quite a few very promiscuous the fellow anyways when a male of our kind choses a mate they have a slight hold over them like when garith first tried to call you to him you tried your hardest to get to him it is normal for you to feel the need to be with him then again in the wood he called to you and you could not help but obey this kind of connection between mates is hard to explain mates are meant to look out for one another nourish and love one another however the way our people go about finding a mate is all wrong garith chose you because of your beauty and your voice his first intention was not to claim you but to kill you see he was sent to the americans to hurt your father you see your father is a well known hunter in our world and he has killed many strong and aspiring vampires a couple of those vampires belonged to gariths coven one was his brother
107423 instead he went against his covens request and made you his mate
107424 he only acted on the simple human qualities garith only wanted you as a trophy you see mary he did not chose you because you were his
107425 you will have to explain what a true mate is
107426 mary i have come to a conclusion that we are all created for someone like eve was created for adam and only one person is our match the way we find out match or our true mate is through our chemistry how we feel around one another for instance when you fed from me i felt nothing different than when the twins feed from me however when you feed from kami its a different story
107427 your body becomes warm you have a urning to be closer and your heart beats even things he may say or do may make your heart beat although temporarily kamigishi experiences the same reactions you do when your around him you make his heart beat his body warm and several other things you are the only person who has made him feel different and i believe he is the only one who will do the same for you
107428 he refuses to believe what darien has been telling him just because you
107429 he will come around when he realizes he can not be without you
107430 i know this is a little hard to believe but i have never been able to witness such a wonderful thing
107431 lo ltimo que se me pasa por la cabeza cuando ponemos un radar son las multas
107432 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
107433 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
107434 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
107435 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
107436 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
107437 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
107438 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
107439 with all due respect to you personally i will defend myself before this institution as i would defend myself before any natural catastrophe
107440 i have not found one bone of my children yet and there he is alive
107441 today i feel there is a bit of justice in this otherwise really pitiful world
107442 its the beast i did not believe it until now
107443 happy because the world seems to be not as bad as i thought so far if it forced him to the courtroom sad because 100 000 people he killed are not watching this
107444 to negotiate an agreement with milosevic and two of karadzics henchmen that karadzic would quit as president of the serbian portion of bosnia and as head of his political party immediately and disappear from public life
107445 reluctantly signed that agreement without ever coming to the negotiations
107446 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it

107453 this is one release you may want to actually spend money on
107454 its on a mud flat at the moment and we are trying to get closer to it
107455 its flapping its tail and moving its head so its still with us its a case of waiting until the tide rises to hopefully get it back into the water
107456 as the tide comes in it lifts the whole contraption up which gives us control of the whale
107457 its really a race against time once the whale is in the water we dont have much control over it and it will go where it wants to
107458 we have the fire brigade down there with a mud rescue kit because its actually stranded on the mud so its quite difficult to get to
107459 the fire brigade are hosing it down because they dont want the skin to dry out
107460 my dearest ive missed you very very much since that last night we were together i will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come ive been turning it over and over in my mind lately ive read your letter through at least four times and will probably read it more times before im through ive been sitting here looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute ive wanted that picture more than anything i know of except of course you yourself i keep thinking of you darling keep wishing i could be home with you i want to leave in the worst possible way so i can come home to see you but things dont look so good on that subject this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone i guess ive never been so lonesome in my life as i am right now im completely lost without you darling i never realized i could miss any one person so much i just hope it wont be too much longer until im able to be with you again and live a sane and normal life
107461 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
107462 you could argue that a military industrial complex needs an enemy im not saying that but it has been proffered before
107463 looks like they called in all the paranormal assholes for this one

107483 its not a sure thing in other words that an a la carte menu will end up giving us the widest possible array of choices
107484 the transcontinental railroad was to the real estate of inland america as itunes is to the music marketplace of today
107485 the event felt especially energetic since there were so many new ideas about distributing movies and connecting with audiences and lots of folks eager to hear those ideas
107486 i decided that the only way to prevent yahoo from spoiling sports and other shows was to never go to their homepage hence no more yahoo search for me
107487 hollywood believes large scale broadband video distribution would only destroy proven value fail to provide alternative value and alter a business model that is still far from being in decline with near total control of the most valuable program libraries and the business models governing their distribution a shift towards broadband media will come largely on hollywoods terms and at an incremental pace
107488 although 180solutions has come to realize that third party distribution can be hard to police we believe it is possible to properly balance who we do business with while providing monetization methods for the long tail of web publishers and content developers
107489 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click the cost is my inventory of space not googles so every click is gravy to google and every exposure is value to the advertiser in effect google is giving away exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for
107490 when i came to this slide during my presentation in san jose i asked the audience how many were familiar with the long tail concept practically no one was yesterday the same thing happened with my chicago audience of about 300 people maybe 10 percent of the hands went up when i asked how many knew about the long tail
107491 as the data indicates recommendation tools can provide important stimuli for increasing the diversity of music from genres to artists to which consumers are exposed recommendation tools can be a crucial component in driving demand for back catalogs as a source of high margin revenue for rights holders as well as toward niche artists and music that they otherwise would
107492 on november 13 2005 google announced google analytics a free web analytics service targeted at the long tail of small and medium size businesses that lack a web analytics solution
107493 the real issue for the studios is how they can dig into this potential gold mine without undermining their existing revenue streams
107494 la times on the end of the mass moviegoing era
107495 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
107496 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues
107497 bollywood tv says it has the internet rights to more than 730 indian films though at any one time on its site i have not seen more than 100 movies
107498 1 every dollar coming out of print advertising revenue for newspapers is replaced by only 33 cents online 2 the largest 50 web companies are attracting 96 of the ad spending on line according to pricewaterhouse coopers with the majority going to aol google msn and yahoo
107499 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
107500 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings
107501 search engines have the effect of counteracting the skewed distribution of links in the web directing some traffic toward sites that users would never visit otherwise
107502 lets say that joss whedon creator of firefly wanted to bring the series back to air
107503 the big companies have mostly finished their erp and crm implementations which is why oracle has been on a buying binge the action today is in small and medium sized businesses smbs from a service producers point of view how can we service smbs profitably on fairly short engagements with 1 or a few consultants and from the smbs point of view how can they add the it talent that they dont have in house in the short small doses when they need it
107504 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
107505 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
107506 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
107507 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
107508 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
107509 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail
107510 three weeks ago sheffields arctic monkeys entered the uk charts at number one with their second single i bet you look good on the dancefloor they had just played their second london gig before an audience of 3 000 even by the hyper speed standards of modern rock and pop this was a remarkable rise apparently made possible only because the band had posted their songs on their website and thus built up a vast virtual fanbase before even securing a record deal
107511 in the latest sign that the rules of television are being turned on their head the two divisions of time warner inc
107512 but within their niche they dominate a site that ranks as number 100 000 in the overall web universe would still be the fifth largest within its niche big enough to throw some weight around furthermore niches have their own niches focusing on a highly targeted subtopic can make even a tiny site with a few hundred thousand page views stand out
107513 the business is made much more complex by windows and audiences that are fragmenting
107514 the story for the next 10 years is how content is going to adapt you wont find your audience in any one place anymore
107515 allow people to buy stuff the way they want to so that you can wring every last cent out of your content by earning 1 from someone who isnt willing to spend 10 for the entire book perhaps someone will shortly suggest a subscription model for online books sign up for a membership plan and get to read as many books as you want or a specified monthly quota on your computer but without being able to download or print the books probably too easily hackable but much more appealing to me because it means having a potentially huge number of books available for actual reading on your desktop without even having to trudge down to the library
107516 the executives at dmg still seem to be in the process of choosing a business model last year the company said it planned to beef up hiring so it could sign promote and market undiscovered artists in may it abruptly shifted gears laying off seven of its 15 workers and decided to focus on buying the rights of golden oldies also in the second quarter the company took a 75 000 writedown for a non recoverable advance it made to an unnamed recording artist
107517 in 1976 punk broke onto the music scene and changed the rules of music music was democratized you didnt even need to be able to sing or know how to play music you just needed a guitar now blogging is having the same impact on publishing of course a lot of rubbish gets produced but some great gems get created too that wouldnt have normally been produced under the old system this is the era of punk publishing look around the blogosphere can you spot the sex pistols or the clash can you see a great entrepreneur like the one we got from that era richard branson
107518 the obscure articles edited by a few authors that know about the subject are honestly some of the best in wikipedia i think as long as they are not about anything controversial usually they arent though or they would have more editors
107519 i am wallowing in composers and works that i had never heard of svendsen vieuxtemps pitfield grieg other than the great piano concerto
107520 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
107521 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear
107522 id like to suggest that theres a 4th ascendant force 4 increasing opportunities to reuse content product service in new and more convenient contexts
107523 if your posts have contextual advertising just because they dont earn any ad revenue right away does not mean that they will not give you a healthy return over several years make regular but relevant references to your older posts to help the long tail phenomenon on its way
107524 a new low cost hardware and software b cost effective services providing next to unlimited hosting space and bandwidth costs for independent producers c new ways modes and devices to access store retrieve and play back video content on personal home and portable media devices d online content clearinghouses search engines and human ratings and recommendations e p2p distribution technologies f powerful technology based innovations slashing marketing and distribution costs
107525 you dont need an oxbridge degree a million dollar trust fund or a nobel peace prize to earn the respect of women these days just head out to the shops and buy yourself a designer bag better yet make it the it bag of the season
107526 for example i was at a popular geek hangout iin my neighborhood named crepes on cole and noticed that the onion had an ad for magnolia a beer pub theyre just 5 blocks away from where i was having my coffee brilliant
107527 one notion in particular might help mainstream companies the meme about the perpetual beta were so used to not releasing a product a service an idea until its fully baked but with the web 2 0 you have permission to play around with things to work on them as people are watching with the help of people
107528 made little impression in his native land and his impact was only slightly greater in england and france yet he is responsible for inventions familiar and useful to us all he was the first to devise and publish all of the common statistical graphs the pie chart the bar chart and the statistical line graph
107529 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder
107530 bridging the digital divide is all about serving the longest tail by driving down price and driving up access and interoperability what is happening in massachusetts is the beginning of a global realization that governments have a productive obligation to serve the longest tail their citizenry by deploying open accessible standards not the technology of a single company
107531 just one of a search engine spammers spam sites could have 30 000 pages
107532 a key result of the shift in distribution patterns was the streamlining of the way retailers ordered books from publishers
107533 im working on an r amp d project at at amp t labs that employs an in house sampling algorithm that has been proven optimal in its ability to reduce yet retain accuracy of data that follows a heavy long tailed distribution were currently using this algorithm in a product that measures ip internet protocol traffic volumes which happen to follow the lt distribution in enormous networks im very interested in applying this technology to other lt distributions that can potentially benefit i e environments that produce lt distribution data in large volumes
107534 in exchange for access to the thousands of promotracks available in the system qualified podcasters and bloggers must comply with a few simple rules designed to raise awareness of the artists and labels and drive sales of their music
107535 japanese has a tradition of being insular most of us dont have tendency to be passionate to niche foreign culture mostly because of language barrier
107536 at least 80 of the traffic i get to posts after 3 months are via the search engines that match niche content with niche interests the filters of the web
107537 i see lots of similarities between the long tail and web 2
107538 how can you filter streams of complex information to pull out only what you want
107539 new communication technologies and the lowered cost of participation they created allowed the linux movement to effectively harness a large and diverse wealth of programming power that would otherwise have been unavailable to it
107540 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly
107541 since inception in october 2003 more than 1 5 million viewers have tuned in to fieldhockeytv currently spring 2005 between 20 and 30 000 viewers connect weekly to the worlds global hockey channel during events such as the hockey champions trophy our viewing numbers show a dramatic increase to 50 70 000 viewers per week
107542 the complexity of the threat posed by open source warfare in iraq has accelerated the us militarys use of outsourcing traditionally the long tail has been used to describe the number of support personnel the tail required to support combat troops the tooth tooth to tail ratios have grown over the years as the complexity and resource intensity of modern combat has increased in essence modern warfare requires a loooong tail of support troops the us militarys tooth to tail ratio is approximately 1 to 10 or more
107543 as in other domains this move towards distributed creation and production is being driven by more affordable and accessible tools of production the backwoods meth producer is a direct descendant of the backwoods hootch producer during the prohibition we may not like what they are producing but history has shown they will be quite creative in finding ways to produce it themselves the mit fab lab participant the remix dj at the local hip nightclub the extreme sports enthusiast and the backwoods meth producer all share a common passion producing goods and experiences on their own terms
107544 consider postal service fulfillment of transactions made on the internet about two million prescriptions a day roughly one fifth of the total are delivered by first class mail ebays vendors list five million new items daily and those that are sold ship mainly by mail one pitney bowes study found that online retailers were increasingly using paper catalogs sent through the mail to steer people to their sites
107545 some tracks will dip as low at 39 pence 72 cents halving itunes and virgin price points as part of the hmv plan developing artist tracks and deeper catalog will carry the lower price points while premium songs will carry higher tags in the end hmv will buck the uniform pricing approach popularized by itunes a result that major labels have been pushing for
107546 paypals transaction fee is typically volume based and ranges from 1 9 to 2 9 percent in addition to a charge of 0 30 per transaction in the case of the new model for micro payments which paypal describes as payments of less than 2 the fee is 5 percent plus 0 05 per transaction

107548 to me this shows another crack in the traditional producer distribution audience models it is obvious that scholars and professionals were not the audience the two beethoven enthusiasts were first doing what they wanted to enjoy and couldnt find and now they are hoping to reach the mainstream in a way academicians and virtuosos cant as doc searls points out this is the demand side supplying itself
107549 urban theorist jane jacobs observed many years ago that paradoxically huge cities create environments where small niches can flourish a store selling nothing but buttons most likely wont be able to find a market in a town of 50 000 people but in new york city theres an entire button store district subcultures thrive in big cities for this reason as well if you have idiosyncratic tastes youre much more likely to find someone who shares those tastes in a city of 9 million people
107550 netflix makes it harder and harder for a customer to consider leaving the system for a competitor the more the user sees benefit from participation the more they give the more they give the less likely they are to leave even if there was a way to take your data to another service the system builds loyalty to the brand and the user experience that theyve spent time and energy learning
107551 knowing that it would be difficult to match wal mart and best buys prices on the sale of new dvds without wreaking havoc on its margins blockbuster has instead decided to concentrate on the sales of used videos next year the company plans to make selling and trading used dvds and its video game operation priorities
107552 in a world in which consumers can increasingly access precisely what they want on the device and in the location they chose for the price they want to pay the ability to use repackage and market content to meet users higher customization personalization and functionality standards gets you a lucrative seat at the big table but playing that game means changing relationships at every level of the media and entertainment supply and demand food chain from content distributors providers and producers as well as advertisers and marketers
107553 in this new world of choice and control at the edges its the niches and those who can pull them together who win besides a universal top n00 list is even a bad execution of big media think when ad age gives you lists of magazine revenue it separates womens and entertainment and business publications in big media those pass as niches and they are far more valuable comparisons when talking about newspapers you dont lump in metro papers with town papers with trade papers its a meaningless lump when somebody can tell me who the queen of the knitting bloggers is then ill listen and so will knitting advertisers
107554 one by one the big houses in new york looked at
107555 the new dvd audience is so diverse that companies can target niche markets and still sell millions of disks
107556 battelle is interested in the application of search to untapped markets or
107557 the blog powered process that the two writers are using may be an effective way to refine ideas and ensure their survival
107558 radio and tv are going to have to adjust to a new economy the economy in which the long tail plays a major role
107559 now you have paid online radio and free online radio paid online video and free online video at first the paid stuff is good and the free stuff is less good but soon producers seeking an audience start to make their stuff free because when they do the audience goes up 100x and then in order to compete others do the same thing wouldnt you if you had a touring band wouldnt you if you had already exhausted your dvd sales and wanted a big enough audience for your sequel
107560 what about implicit events like the opening hours of the local go kart race track
107561 the long tail approach to keywords advocates the use of
107562 the movie studios to their credit use a form of dynamic pricing they intelligently recognize that a content items value is highest when first released and then subsequently fades the music labels have mostly avoided this strategy but perhaps thats changing i just noticed this little tidbit on amazon a long list of interesting cds for sale on amazon for between 6 and 10
107563 we can study a culture by studying the differences in the power law approximated by the tag clouds used by people of that culture we could even measure cultural eartquakes by measuring the difference between the tag cloud being generated before and after a certain event
107564 it makes them complacent look at all the money still rolling in
107565 compare the tv model to music music is released television is scheduled thats going to change since the mid 1990s the internet has shown people a different model one where you get what you want when you want it where the channel model is replaced by the site model channels are limited sites are not
107566 at the heart of ceo marc benioffs strategy is the idea that companies with deep industry knowledge will have more success creating their own specialized programs than salesforce could
107567 microsoft and intel seem to think it is in their interest to cooperate with this approach and limit the ability of users to find new opportunities the long tail gets truncated its like cisco helping china control the spread of bad ideas

107827 the crew was to jerome anthony and andy they were three of the hardest working gentlemen we have ever seen they were nonstop and in no way did they even consider resting we say gentlemen because they were also very polite respectful and just all around nice it took 7 hours to move just a mile can you imagine if we had to do that all ourselves it would have taken days and then some time in the hospital

107844 in addition to the problems risk of the aggregate economy for a lot of the individual households in this country that will see large increases in their mortgage payments in the next year and a half
107845 well these problems have naturally attracted a good deal of attention as they should from congress the federal reserve and from the administration
107846 theres also i think a widespread sense that we need to improve the information provided to homeowners about mortgages that they will sign up for to reduce the risk of similar problems arising in the future
107847 for the u s to maintain its global economic leadership we must ensure a continuous supply of highly trained mathematicians scientists engineers technicians and scientific support staff

107859 it doesnt recognize it and will not appear before it
107860 we were only shown the document after it was complete and on its way to the president for his signature
107861 it is the judiciary and not the executive branch itself that is the ultimate arbiter of executive privilege
107862 the ruling is a ringing reaffirmation of the fundamental principle of checks and balances and the basic american idea that no person is above the law
107863 would provoke an unseemly constitutional confrontation that should be avoided
107864 the court did not rule on the executive privilege claim it did not order anyone to testify on privileged matters and it did not order anyone to produce privileged documents
107865 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
107866 we almost wish this had been a whodunit but we know who did it the real question was how could they
107867 though it was her mother who actually killed her there are many layers of blame for what happened to danieal kelly from parents to case workers to supervisors to administrators
107868 cheryl ransom garner who was dhs commissioner when danieal died helped set the tone of accountability at dhs when she testified before the grand jury she was asked whether she believed that anyone from dhs bore any responsibility for danieals death she answered that she did not
107869 despicable as the parents were they were not that remarkable there are people like that in the world that is why dhs and the private company hired by dhs exist yet these agencies whose sole function is to be protecting children from such parents passed up almost every opportunity over a period of years to save danieal
107870 in the final weeks of her life danieals brother himself only a child kept telling his mother that something was wrong but she dismissed him shortly before his sister died he begged his mother to call an ambulance she refused only the next day with flies buzzing all over her body was 911 contacted
107871 during this investigation we found a tall filthy cardboard box in dhs social worker dana poindexters cubicle big enough to hold a file cabinet the box was filled to the top with random case files food wrappers and unopened business envelopes some with four year old postmarks at the bottom of the pile was danieals file
107872 even when she personally visited the kelly apartment dhs social worker laura sommerer failed to check on danieal on the last occasion five weeks before the childs death when she had already lost 50 of her weight and at times was left sitting in her own urine and feces sommerer noticed nothing amiss at all
107873 there was plenty of manpower at dhs to make sure that danieal kelly received the services that would not only have saved but improved her life the failure to do so was a failure of inclination at every level of the agency
107874 at least one dhs administrator herself back dated reports about danieal some by more than a year with false dates and determinations to make it look like they had been properly completed she said this was a common practice at dhs
107875 on the afternoon and evening of danieals death part owner director of multiethnic behavior health mickal kamuvaka convened what in essence was a forgery fest in her office she directed employees to concoct almost a years worth of false progress reports to substitute for all the work that had never actually been done
107876 on june 24 2004 dhs received a third report about danieal this time from an anonymous female neighbor
107877 mr miller said he was moved to make the report to dhs because i seen danieal kelly upstairs in a hot room laying in pee no curtains no blinds no fans just laying in pee according to mr miller no one from dhs ever contacted him about this report
107878 the grand jury finds the evidence that the mistreatment suffered by danieal the malnutrition the bed sores the lack of stimulation and the dehydration and heat stress caused her death the photographs taken of danieal first as the healthy and high spirited child enrolled in arizona later as a skeletal corpse in a philadelphia morgue do not lie danieal was a victim of homicide
107879 it is my hope that the american public will some day hear mr hamdans defense
107880 it is a balance between the goal of openness and the need to address some national security concerns
107881 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
107882 im disappointed that sen obama would say the things hes saying
107883 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
107884 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
107885 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
107886 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
107887 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton

107889 la presidenta del organismo legislativo cilia flores pr cticamente reniega la posibilidad que miembros del parlamento del mercosur acudan a venezuela a cerciorarse verificar y constatar la realidad que se est viviendo con los inhabilitados

107891 a los principios y valores ticos y morales que los llevaron a ocupar esos cargos de representaci n judicial y que en definitiva no permitan que el pueblo siga en esta incertidumbre
107892 acompa ar a las personas que se les pretende inhabilitar porque en definitiva la unidad del pa s la unidad de los sectores democr ticos est depositado en la solidaridad que debemos dar y brindar a los que hoy pretenden inhabilitar
107893 la unidad no significa solamente que un grupo de partidos pol ticos de oposici n se pongan de acuerdo la unidad es m s que eso es respetar el compromiso suscrito el pasado 23 de enero donde los estudiantes pese a que no lo suscribimos estuvimos de acuerdo porque es un paso importante para demostrarle al pa s que esa misma unidad demostrada el 2d y que en definitiva se debe dar el 23n nos permita acumular fuerza para la lucha que vendr el pr ximo a o cuando el presidente de la rep blica proponga la enmienda constitucional

107904 how can you bring yourself to imitate a people who are but fuel for the fire imitate an object of ridicule a laughing stock you would surely scorn this and become angry how is it then that you imitate the uncircumcised worshipper of the cross in his celebrations how is it that you dress your children with new clothes and inculcate a sense of joy in them how is it that you decorate eggs for them buy incense and celebrate the festival of your enemy in the same fashion as you would celebrate the eid legislated by your prophet sallallahu alaihi wa salam where would such a practice take you except to the anger of allah and his displeasure provided he does not forgive you that is and provided that you know that your prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa salam used to encourage differing from the people of the book in everything that was specific to them

107934 does this have anything to do with hezbollahs attempt to improve its image in the arab world following the beirut may events
107935 we have never seen a hezbollah delegation visiting an arab state like the other parties and forces was this position created to handle the shortcoming at this level and to fill an existing void
107936 there is no shortcoming just a matter of political circumstances knowing that hezbollah always gave attention to this issue

107947 so theres a big hole in the tree canopy so theres a lot of light getting down to the ground and theres a lot of vegetation growing there

108183 our research into insolvency in english football clubs is revealing not so much a beautiful game as an ugly business
108184 in spite of the football associations efforts to deter clubs from following the path of going into administration it remains an all too common choice
108185 in the recent case of luton town a total of 30 points has been deducted 20 of them as a result of becoming insolvent this punishes the club for the misdemeanours of the previous owners
108186 more significantly though it also greatly reduces the chances of the club recovering which is supposed to be a primary objective of seeking the protection of administration in the first place
108187 hm revenue and customs losing their preferential creditor status combined with the football leagues insistence that football creditors other clubs owed money for transfer fess for example remain preferential creditors is proving increasingly problematic in establishing cvas which the league themselves want as a first step out of insolvency
108188 any other industry sector riddled with cvas would have been heavily regulated into line if english football doesnt put itself into order there is a danger that it will be forced to on terms not of its making or preference
108189 we will be continuing to monitor the practice of administration around football clubs in this country
108190 hopefully from the data we gather we will be in a better position to identify what gets clubs into trouble in the first place and what then is going to get them out of trouble
108191 as such our team believes that we can make a strong contribution in helping to establish a more constructive approach to the issue of football club administration in the future

108220 this horrifies me it is another example of how rich people exploit and pollute the planet because of their money
108221 tax increases on income taxes capital gains taxes dividend taxes social security taxes pretty much anything that you can tax
108222 my friends he wants to raise taxes on capital gains there are 100 million americans today that have some kind involvement in capital gains and investments are associated with it so basically when he tells you that hes only going to raise taxes on the rich pay close attention look at the fine print
108223 whenever these kinds of candidates come and say were only going to tax the rich some people are astonished to find themselves in that category

108236 it is clear given his current status that rct rugby club toulonnais is looking for the approval of the irb to sign him
108237 i repeat my earlier request that the irb take all available steps to ensure that the federation of rugby does not register any such contract between that club and mr williams
108238 in light of this request and the fact that mr williams is to play a contract by rct would be the most flagrant interference with the contractual rights of the bulldogs rugby league club
108239 the irb should urgently make it known that it does not authorise this contract and it condemns this action
108240 it appears from your letter that the precise contractual circumstances in relation to this matter have yet to be fully clarified
108241 it would appear that based on the limited information the issue is a private contractual matter between the relevant parties
108242 it is hard being a forward and playing for the all blacks there is an aggression level that you want to have
108243 but it is controlled aggression but you have to be smart as well when you are aggressive sometimes you have to make sure you keep it controlled it can be a fine line sometimes
108244 being aggressive is like you are in attack mode the whole time either in defence or attack you just have to keep it measured so you are not going outside the rules or the boundaries of the game
108245 probably in the springbok test there wasnt much smartness it was just all out aggression that was a heat of the moment where i snapped a bit
108246 i felt different for the australian test so i was pretty darned disappointed how that happened it did feel like bad luck
108247 i am a six foot five guy he is five ten he ran back inside and it felt like i hit him chest high with my hand
108248 it probably looked pretty bad but i didnt think it was actually that bad
108249 to get 10 minutes that early in the game probably knocked me around a bit actually i was pretty disappointed
108250 i had a goal of having controlled aggression and it was pretty weird sitting in that stand
108251 you build up all week doing all the hard work and 10 minutes later i am sitting in the stands it is pretty weird
108252 the referee never looked like not bringing out the card he was always going to sin bin me
108253 it was pretty darned annoying i dont know what it does to you i tried to go back out and get amongst it
108254 something that is pretty important to me is when i get my black jersey it gets presented earlier in the day i look at my name the number of the test it is and look at who we are playing on the sleeve are little things written
108255 i look at the number on the back of the jersey and that is pretty important to me
108256 i would be in europe trying to cash up otherwise
108257 id say he and his family are pretty concerned theyve got some decisions to make
108258 its right leons home with his family he needs a bit of time
108259 you have got to understand that families probably get pretty worried about these things they shouldnt be taken lightly
108260 i know when i used to get concussed it was my wife and my mum that were always more concerned than i was
108261 normally we would disclose everything but we are allowed confidentiality in some issues we wanted to show some empathy with leon and his family so we gave him some time to try and get things right
108262 there are quite a few teams we would like to avoid
108263 that is why it is better not to look at it we will just take who we get
108264 we just have to improve now to use the two tournaments we play to get physically stronger and better then we will play who we get
108265 reuters is carrying an article about a recent mit evolution which may pave the way for solar energy to be collected for use in low input periods by the book to reuters the finding of the a new catalyst for separating hydrogen oxygen from water requires only 10 of the electricity of current methods this would allow storage cells to mission as a form of battery for other forms of energy collection such as solar panels the new method is also much safer and likely environmentally friendly than current methods which require the use of a dangerously caustic environment and specialized storage containers

108272 im the first to admit that but i think people are getting carried away with the way they are writing me off and i hope to get an opportunity soon to prove the critics wrong
108273 i think ruan can do a job there but it is not his best position
108274 he is a brilliant scrum half and that is where he wants to play if anybody should be given a chance at fly half it should be peter grant
108275 i dont enjoy it when i am not playing well and not keeping up and i am very keen to get a chance to prove to myself that i have still got it
108276 i need to know whether i am going to be good enough to play for the springboks next year at the end of the tri nations if i am not happy then it will perhaps be time to retire from international rugby
108277 they want to talk to me about an extension on my contract when i get back and from their point of view it would be easier if i was no longer involved with the boks
108278 the desire is the same there is the same massive excitement on match day and huge pride when i pull on the jersey
108279 but form obviously is what counts and if i am not going to be in the plans for the british lions tour next year which is a major carrot for me then i will move on from the boks and concentrate on finishing my career with bath they have been very good to me i have enjoyed my time there
108280 i signed a two year deal with bath and have never had any intention of dishonouring my commitment to the club i would not let them down by going back on my word
108281 i think everybody including myself has got a bit carried away
108282 i did not play well against the all blacks but was better against australia it has only been a few games a dip in form happens to nearly everybody also the back line did not get good ball in those games
108283 ricky januarie was under pressure in all three tests because of the bad ball he was getting and from bad ball it is difficult for the fly half to run on to the ball and make things happen
108284 in perth where we got a hiding at the breakdowns it was mostly a case of australia being better than us in that area of the game they stole so much ball because we allowed them to

108291 the worst injury was a fractured pelvis another passenger suffered a fractured wrist he said

108301 we had opportunities to do something stupid and we didnt do it
108302 it was really pretty quiet i dont feel like we got terribly close
108303 we didnt have one of those conversations marching toward a conclusion we just didnt have that this particular time
108304 clearly it was not something that intrigued us unless we got something back that made a lot of sense for us and in brians case that was a pretty high bar set but i dont know its accurate that i told people hes off limits i am not doing it because there were some clubs and they called and expressed some interest at the same time i am not of the mind to give clubs false hope
108305 its a relief just because i know where im going to be now
108306 im very pleased with it you want to concentrate on baseball and just go out and do your best every time out and not have anything else on your mind i want to focus on finishing this year strong and hopefully we can talk about doing something long term in the offseason
108307 i hold out hope to the extent that it would be something that makes sense for us
108308 i dont see there to be a benefit of making a deal for the sake of making a deal i think that is where you can make trouble there so my expectation might be not unlike last year we might have more activity in august than we would have in july

108320 so 25 is not a big number over 2 000 and weve had a diversity of different cancers

108322 i dont believe there really is a cluster here at all but we need to take it seriously

108373 for the words that you gave to me i have given to them and they have received them and know in truth and they have believed

108379 lamour dun couple mari exprim dans le sexe rapproche le corps humain du ciel lextase joyeuse dune relation sexuelle peut tre compar e la joie de la vie ternelle

108381 la concentration sur le c t physiologique dun rapport sexuel amoindrit ses l ments les plus importants
108382 quand une femme est excit e elle veut absolument ressentir le m me plaisir que lhomme
108383 pour une femme excit e linsatisfaction sexuelle constitue une grande souffrance physique et psychologique

108385 il coute vraiment les couples et cest pourquoi il nous comprend si bien
108386 cest une approche nouvelle qui permet aux couples datteindre une plus grande intimit
108387 il est in vitable que les peuples de diff rents pays et r gions du monde aient des perceptions qui ne sont pas les m mes sur diff rents sujets
108388 je ne pense pas que politiser les jeux olympiques aidera r pondre cela
108389 cest contraire lesprit olympique ainsi quaux aspirations partag es partout dans le monde

108395 the storm hit just after dark as many were sitting down for dinner she said
108396 in the dining rooms the tables were bolted down but nothing else was and everything just went flying
108397 it was like slow motion but happened so quickly people were desperately trying to grab hold of things to keep safe
108398 just think of the movie poseidon mrs vickers told fairfax
108399 when the ship went on that angle they were thrown around people would have been suffering bruises and cuts and there may have been stitches required he said
108400 forty two people went to visit the medical centre three people were under medical supervision when the ship came into port
108401 the worst injury was a fractured pelvis another passenger suffered a fractured wrist he said
108402 no one has lost a foot and no one has lost fingers it is not correct
108403 the captain was trying to avoid this weather but he came across it and the ship started rolling the ship rolled about 20 degrees which got things moving
108404 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
108405 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
108406 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
108407 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
108408 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
108409 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
108410 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
108411 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
108412 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
108413 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
108414 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
108415 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
108416 the americans must know very clearly where we are standing
108417 there is wall to wall consensus across the political spectrum that iran must not acquire nuclear weapons and therefore olmerts decision to eventually resign from office has no bearing on the iranian issue
108418 historic steps to provide students with the tools the means and the power to get a higher education
108419 i feel like weve been on third base for 6 1 2 years
108420 to address soaring costs this legislation will address the transparency and the accountability of the tuition pricing system shining a bright light on the prices set by colleges and universities
108421 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
108422 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
108423 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
108424 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
108425 its doesnt bother me that some people dont like my work
108426 we understand that this is a substantial expenditure of public funds but we believe strongly that it was entirely appropriate under the circumstances to facilitate the truthful cooperation of the caucus staff with the attorney generals investigation
108427 and took them through the process of cooperating with the government and telling the truth
108428 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet

108436 has enthusiastically agreed to stay on if the offer is successful
108437 its disconcerting given that almost every early indicator we had was pointing to modest growth and to basically have every missing piece of the puzzle wind up on the down side is unnerving it does suggest there is some very real underlying weakness here in the economy
108438 it identified a number of areas from safety right down to lighting on the vehicles what was needed for inclement weather etc
108439 it identified if it would impede any traffic which it didnt do and it allowed the province to set guidelines on where these trucks could travel when they could travel and at what speed
108440 it showed us that going into the future it is an environmentally friendly way for the trucking industry to move freight because we are coming into the era of the new clean diesel truck plus two trailers
108441 and from the human resource standpoint in a crunch when it comes to drivers there is only one driver for what would be two trucks
108442 many customers of the port and especially those involved in trans load want to use the vehicles to transport their goods to inland markets
108443 this pilot provides options for our customers to grow their business through the port of halifax
108444 improved overall investment results over the remainder of the year and in future years will be required in order to retain existing clients and attract new clients
108445 unfortunately with assets under management down 22 per cent year to year and seven per cent quarter to quarter the momentum remains downward
108446 the maximum rate set by the board must be sufficiently high to allow the marketplace to function properly while also preventing lenders from charging excessive fees and charges
108447 todays ruling represents a ceiling on rates it ensures that no loan shall ever cost more than 31 per 100 but most players will compete with each other to provide lower rates to attract consumers requiring this service
108448 we had recommended that the board take a market based approach and they set a cap that would be high enough for existing operators to operate and also to encourage competition to enter the market we believe they have done that
108449 to place its own view on the morality of an industry above that of the elected federal and provincial legislatures
108450 parliament and the nova scotia legislature have determined that payday loans can be legally made at loan costs in excess of 60 per cent
108451 there is evidence certainly before the board to support there is a competitive market in the greater metro area but whether that is really the case when you get into smaller towns and communities across the province i think that remains at least for me very much an open ended question
108452 just as apple has changed peoples view of what it should be like to use a mobile phone so palringo aims to change the way people see messaging billions of people already use instant messaging on their home or work computers to communicate with each other palringo has added vocal instant messaging and picture messaging and has put im on the iphone thats a great combination
108453 although we have arrested and charged a man in connection with this incident i am very keen to trace three further people who could be potential witnesses to this incident
108454 the first man i would like to speak to was riding a push bike at the time of the incident and we believe he may have stopped and seen the incident take place
108455 we then believe he may have made a phone call on his mobile before riding off
108456 the second man i am keen to trace is the driver of a small white van which is described as being smaller than a transit van
108457 we believe he may also have information in relation to the incident which could help with our enquiries
108458 the third man i would like to speak to is a described as an african caribbean male who was driving a rusty coloured or maroon car
108459 we believe he may have stopped and called out at the people involved in the incident
108460 i would urge these men to contact me without delay as you could hold information which would greatly assist us with our investigation
108461 las empresas quieren decir que puedes contactar con ellas pero eso no significa que ellas vayan a contactar contigo
108462 las empresas no s lo est n perdiendo dinero en ventas sino que tambi n est n perdiendo reconocimiento de marca cuando los correos electr nicos se env an a un extra o espacio de correo que en realidad nadie mira
108463 considerando que internet ha revolucionado la mayor a de los negocios y la cantidad que se gasta en publicidad y en generar ventas es una negligencia total para las empresas ignorar las preguntas de correo electr nico
108464 i anticipated that was going to happen because once he makes that judgment its automatic
108465 i dont think the umpire made the proper judgment because the game situation didnt call for that but he made the judgment that he did and well go from there were going to encourage the player to appeal it and im confident that theyll look favorably on the appeal
108466 doesnt throw that hard and doesnt have very good stuff
108467 i know everybody in the whole stadium and every player they know im not trying to hit a rod
108468 how am i going to put someone on base so it surprised me
108469 i didnt expect the last question to be the most difficult one
108470 if i were to choose an event to compete in i would choose table tennis
108471 but i want to tell you that as the line up of the chinese table tennis team is already finalized it seems my hope is unlikely to be realized
108472 we didnt have one of those situations where we had several conversations marching toward a conclusion
108473 i hold out hope to the extent that it would be something that makes sense for us
108474 it a roberts deal was not something that intrigued us unless we got something we really wanted with brian roberts that was a very high bar to clear
108475 we just didnt find an intersection of self interest between ourselves and another club you have to discipline yourself so you dont come out with something just to say you made a trade
108476 he left on july3 2004 went to the olympics and never came home
108477 as a mom you know theyll all leave that they wont live with you forever
108478 ill always remember that the weather just paralleled my feelings
108479 just because i love it and miss it so much
108480 its hard to really put it into three things i think i just miss baltimore as a whole
108481 being away from a place youve been for almost 20 years all the sudden i pick up and move its just completely different from baltimore its so much smaller theres not as much to do baltimore has everything anything and everything whenever you want wherever you want
108482 he was just a 18 19 year old kid still living at home
108483 hed never really been outside of his comfort zone he needed to do that for himself
108484 i remember he was standing there scraping and he said yeah its really cold here
108485 that was the first hint i had that he might someday return
108486 and told me im buying a house in fells point
108487 the storm hit just after dark as many were sitting down for dinner she said
108488 in the dining rooms the tables were bolted down but nothing else was and everything just went flying
108489 it was like slow motion but happened so quickly people were desperately trying to grab hold of things to keep safe
108490 just think of the movie poseidon mrs vickers told fairfax
108491 when the ship went on that angle they were thrown around people would have been suffering bruises and cuts and there may have been stitches required he said
108492 forty two people went to visit the medical centre three people were under medical supervision when the ship came into port
108493 the worst injury was a fractured pelvis another passenger suffered a fractured wrist he said
108494 no one has lost a foot and no one has lost fingers it is not correct
108495 the captain was trying to avoid this weather but he came across it and the ship started rolling the ship rolled about 20 degrees which got things moving
108496 im just here to help any way that i can
108497 oh yeah that was a rabbit out of the hat
108498 i had no idea he offensive line coach john matsko told me it was going to go a little fast for me they gave me this look today and the next thing you know i was in there with the first team
108499 i know everybodys got guys like chad on their short list and in some ways maybe some things happen for a reason were fortunate to get him
108500 well figure that out probably two days before the first preseason game
108501 were looking at options as far as getting guys out to practice
108502 we dont want to overwork willis because hes really been working hard but the knee is tender right now so weve got to be smart about that position
108503 we told the guys today that the cloud cover was on the schedule
108504 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
108505 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
108506 it will just be good to see this group thrive
108507 weve worked hard at it weve made some great strides it would be good to get that confirmation that we have made progress tomorrow night
108508 but if were sitting here tomorrow night having come second then youll probably suggest that weve made no progress whatsoever
108509 the sheer weight of numbers 1986 its an indicator of what it takes and obviously what weve brought in the past hasnt been enough and were conscious of that but really keen about that as well
108510 you hate missing any games but certainly i was really buoyed by the way the team played last week
108511 in sport you tend to find that those sort of hoodoos or a string of matches either won or lost but they always get broken eventually
108512 i suspect this weekend could be a grind it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama
108513 we monitor and manage our weeks according to our state and i think these guys are probably in better shape now for this challenge than they would have been in week one or week two
108514 these guys will be up for this theyve got a challenge its very clear how significant that challenge is its obvious for all to see but theyre excited
108515 theyre standing at the foot of the hill and theyre ready to climb theyre just waiting for the whistle
108516 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
108517 we understand that bocog will give details to the media very soon of how the matter has been addressed we trust them to keep their promise
108518 ive heard that the issue has been resolved and i am very happy about that promises were made about a free internet and we are glad to hear that they are going to be respected
108519 they the files regarding salaries were on that infamous file server computer that was taken to london
108520 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
108521 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
108522 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
108523 the secretary general operates the entire party its an attractive position for mr aso
108524 the flip side of that is he cannot turn down the offer to take the position
108525 reforms that put a stress on consumers and ordinary people as well as the importance of revitalising the economy
108526 id be happy with a win against afghanistan at the moment let alone a top four team
108527 ive even been playing on the playstation getting wins on that at the moment
108528 obviously lukes got seven weeks of energy to use and we need him to go out and concentrate on his game and not get caught up any incidents that can take away from his performance
108529 hes an outstanding player and he brings a lot to us in terms of his go forward and as a defender
108530 hes just a guy who inspires other players and he will make them feel comfortable
108531 but we need for him not to get caught up in any outside influences
108532 the thing about ash hes got great footwork and hes a player who can chime in and cause some doubts
108533 carl played really strong last week got run under his belt and im not sure hes a play you want to take on
108534 his go forward was exceptional his minutes were good and hell give us some stability around the rucks and some authority with luke that weve probably been lacking
108535 they score a lot of tries from kicks they very good at that
108536 theyve got state of origin halves and theyre a quality team
108537 his progress is fantastic but he wont be back until the titans game in two weeks
108538 we havent given up hope of winning games or getting off the bottom
108539 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
108540 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
108541 were obviously looking at all options because that would mean if we maintain our present policy with stadia we would have a very crowded mcg and telstra dome
108542 we cant play any more games at skilled stadium so one option obviously is to play as many games at telstra dome and the mcg or to have a look at another option which could be a boutique stadium
108543 obviously one option is a boutique stadium that might hold 26 to 28 games with a capacity of 25 000 people
108544 were just doing the work now we discussed it with the club ceos at a conference we had yesterday and the day before
108545 we basically said to them that we understand that the stadium economics isnt working for the clubs in melbourne that we need to try and get a better return out of the mcg and telstra dome for them
108546 and down the track if and when we introduce the two teams in 2011 and 2012 there could be if we go to 24 rounds an extra 40 games and about 26 or 28 of those could be in melbourne
108547 they certainly want to be there at the table if and when we decide we might go further or there might be a victorian club thats interested in relocating
108548 we think its terribly important that tasmania puts their bid in
108549 i think tasmania could play an integral role in our national competition and theyve got a rich history of football theyre very decent people theyve served us very well with the relationship with hawthorn theyve invested in york park in launceston
108550 at a point in time why not what happens down the track with tasmania thats up for grabs and its all the more reason why they should be getting their bid together
108551 something that we havent had in my time with the club is a genuine out and out playmaker who can create opportunities and its good to have that string to our bow now
108552 apart from charlies ability on the park i think his experience off it was the thing that attracted me
108553 im 32 and i still want to win myself i like to win trophies and i think weve got a great bunch of boys here
108554 hopefully ill enjoy my football and have a laugh on the field
108555 but im here to be serious and win trophies no doubt about it
108556 the selectors felt that michael crocker and danny buderus werent deserting rugby league in australia
108557 they felt theyve given absolutely great service to rugby league here and they just got to that stage in their career where theyre going to move so they can lengthen it a little
108558 so they felt under those circumstances where theyve given great service they should be rewarded by being considered for this
108559 i dont pick the team ive made an opinion about what i feel is a leagues decision in regards to players going to england
108560 the form of danny buderus and michael crocker warrants their selection in this squad and if they continue on that form theyll warrant selection in regards to the world cup
108561 it todays squad is a great purpose of showing the players that we are very happy with in regards to playing in the world cup and being involved in that australian team
108562 and also for the players that havent been picked and think they should be there its a great opportunity to show over the next six weeks plus semi finals that they have the form to warrant a position in the team
108563 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
108564 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
108565 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
108566 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
108567 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
108568 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
108569 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
108570 without a doubt the humanitarian challenge in afghanistan continues to grow insurgent and criminal attacks have prevented us from reaching some the countrys most vulnerable communities

108585 we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street
108586 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
108587 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
108588 he was not arrested and did not attend a police station inquiries continue
108589 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
108590 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
108591 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

108629 if we define an american fascist as one who in case of conflict puts money and power ahead of human beings then there are undoubtedly several million fascists in the united states there are probably several hundred thousand if we narrow the definition to include only those who in their search for money and power are ruthless and deceitful they are patriotic in time of war because it is to their interest to be so but in time of peace they follow power and the dollar wherever they may lead
108630 still another danger is represented by those who paying lip service to democracy and the common welfare in their insatiable greed for money and the power which money gives do not hesitate surreptitiously to evade the laws designed to safeguard the public from monopolistic extortion american fascists of this stamp were clandestinely aligned with their german counterparts before the war and are even now preparing to resume where they left off after the present unpleasantness ceases
108631 the symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances but always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power it is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice it may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that without meaning to do so they hold views in common with hitler when they preach discrimination
108632 the myth of fascist efficiency has deluded many people democracy to crush fascism internally must develop the ability to keep people fully employed and at the same time balance the budget it must put human beings first and dollars second it must appeal to reason and decency and not to violence and deceit we must not tolerate oppressive government or industrial oligarchy in the form of monopolies and cartels
108633 out of this modern civilization economic royalists have carved new dynasties it was natural and perhaps human that the privileged princes of these new economic dynasties thirsting for power reached out for control over government itself they created a new despotism and wrapped it in the robes of legal sanction and as a result the average man once more confronts the problem that faced the minute man

108641 is it not to divide your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into the house when you see the naked to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh
108642 for if you truly amend your ways and your deeds if you truly practice justice between a man and his neighbor
108643 administer justice every morning and deliver the person who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor that my wrath may not go forth like fire and burn with none to extinguish it because of the evil of their deeds
108644 but your eyes and your heart are intent only upon your own dishonest gain and on shedding innocent blood and on practicing oppression and extortion
108645 thus has the lord of hosts said dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother

108660 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
108661 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
108662 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
108663 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
108664 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
108665 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
108666 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
108667 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
108668 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
108669 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
108670 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
108671 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
108672 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
108673 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
108674 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
108675 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

108677 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
108678 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
108679 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

108683 opponents of a proposed 450 million research lab took control of two public hearings tuesday making it clear to state and federal officials that efforts to build the project in granville county would trigger a lengthy battle the 520 000 square foot lab about five times the size of a regular wal mart would handle a wide range of pathogens that could be used as biological threats about 10 percent of the lab would be set aside for viruses with no known cures

108687 the army said yesterday that a mustard gas leak had been detected inside a storage igloo at the blue grass army depot near richmond but the leak presents no danger to the community or the environment the u s army chemical materials agency said richard sloan spokesman for the blue grass chemical activity said the leak was very small very minute

108689 australia is prepared to send military advisers to pakistan to help its army in training for counter insurgency warfare and stabilising the border with afghanistan defence minister joel fitzgibbon will today call for a more concerted international effort to combat taliban insurgents based in pakistans tribal areas including economic aid and providing its army with the skills to conduct counter insurgency campaigns as well as civil operations
108690 hawaii and california national guard troops are joining big island police and fire units for a week of training and exercises to deal with a terrorist attack or a major hazardous material release this weeks effort is designed to help the personnel respond to an act of terrorism involving chemical biological radiological or nuclear weapons officials said
108691 science and technology are usually seen as western strengths in fighting terrorism counterterrorism depends on science but at the same time science generates terrorist risks and could compound the problems terrorism creates for a start scientists engineers and doctors have played a considerable role as terrorists since the mid 20th century the high status of these professions may be partly responsible as modern terrorists are drawn disproportionately from the better educated sections of societies
108692 u s forces struck a suspected al qaeda hideout inside pakistan monday exposing growing tensions between the allies over pakistans inability to deal with militants in its tribal regions the attack believed to have killed a top al qaeda chemical and biological weapons expert came as pakistans prime minister yousaf raza gilani arrived in washington in an effort to reassure americans of his countrys efforts to eradicate the militants based in pakistan who are believed to be feeding the rising insurgency in afghanistan
108693 nanotechnology driven development could affect many areas of space exploration it could create new materials that are stronger and self healing for example or develop tiny rovers capable of driving flying and taking measurements other applications in security for example the sensor could be useful in detecting nerve gas or anthrax it could also be used in environmental monitoring which is why a partnership formed between dr meyyappans team and early warning a company based in new york that develops systems to detect biohazards
108694 some information in the cia charge sheet were so damning that the pakistanis could not deny them
108695 what they found lacking was the depth of understanding and vision in dealing with complex international and security issues articulation to comprehend and project pakistani policies in a clear and candid way more so on public places than in closed door meetings they did not find the will and the capacity in the prime minister to grasp the importance of issues take control of matters and make decisions which he could sustain
108696 the one issue which damaged gilanis credibility as a potentially serious leader and policy maker was the brutally botched up isi fiasco whoever did this to gilani actually torpedoed his us visit which turned into a non starter the moment the isi notification was withdrawn it was beyond gilani to stand by his order for more than a few hours and washingtonians got the message that they were dealing with a non entity and should not take him seriously
108697 but the moment the script was over and he had to answer questions the level of discourse and understanding came crashing down to earth the contrast was so stark and embarrassing it discounted both the images gilani presented and made him look like artificial and someone who was being remote controlled
108698 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
108699 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
108700 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
108701 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
108702 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
108703 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
108704 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
108705 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
108706 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
108707 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
108708 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
108709 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
108710 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
108711 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
108712 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
108713 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
108714 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
108715 the weather overall seems bad and going by the meteorological departments forecast for delhi the chances of watching the solar eclipse are low
108716 if the cloud cover clears between 4 to 6 p m delhi is set to see quite a large fraction of the disk of the sun covered by the moon during this eclipse
108717 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
108718 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
108719 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
108720 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
108721 there has been a surge in the number of civilian casualties caused by all sides a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas and increasing attacks on aid agencies and their staff
108722 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year the number of insurgent attacks for each of the months of may 463 june 569 and july is greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
108723 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
108724 according to initial estimates there have been more than 260 civilian casualties in july of this year higher than any other month in the past six years
108725 the increased number of air strikes by international military forces which are up by approximately 40 per cent on last year has also contributed to the rising civilian death toll
108726 none of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this act may be used to prohibit or discourage the use of the words or phrases jihadist jihad islamo fascism caliphate islamist or islamic terrorist by or within the intelligence community or the federal government
108727 there is no prohibition in this to quoting the statements of osama bin laden and others who use these hateful words why would we want to censor that the prohibition is directed at ourselves words that will inflame the very communities were trying to convince i would just close with the observation that if we had thought a little longer about using the phrase axis of evil
108728 how will america understand the nature and the character of our enemy if we cant use the words that they use to describe themselves and we need to come up with a whole new language that is totally out of context with the enemy and the nature of the threat that we face today
108729 not to give the radical jihadists a victory hereby imposing a speech code on americas intelligence community
108730 speaks regularly at one of detroits largest mosques masjid wali muhammad where he is an associate imam was the first nation of islam temple in the country ever built according to walid
108731 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
108732 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
108733 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
108734 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
108735 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
108736 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
108737 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
108738 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
108739 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
108740 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
108741 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
108742 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
108743 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
108744 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
108745 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
108746 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
108747 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
108748 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
108749 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
108750 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
108751 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
108752 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
108753 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
108754 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
108755 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
108756 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
108757 happily dixons bracing initiation is even handed enough to inspire jolts of defensive ire in readers of every stripe
108758 a treasure trove of anecdotes quotes obscure and reassuringly familiar odd poetry and pub trivia
108759 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
108760 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
108761 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
108762 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
108763 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
108764 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
108765 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
108766 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
108767 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

108771 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
108772 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
108773 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
108774 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
108775 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
108776 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
108777 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
108778 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
108779 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
108780 who are open to doing something on the production side
108781 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
108782 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
108783 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
108784 the situation has become critical and threatens the safety and security of the nation and its residents
108785 we are deeply disturbed by this imminent loss of communications service to vital public safety agencies
108786 in just a few days the navajo nation will lose its entire communications network including its public safety network as a byproduct of usacs mishandling of this matter
108787 sadly mothers are also no longer able to reach out and communicate with their children at war in iraq
108788 an internal navajo nation audit conducted during the summer of 2007 found problems with the contract between navajo nation and onsat and the bidding process that led to it
108789 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
108790 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
108791 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
108792 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
108793 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
108794 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
108795 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
108796 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
108797 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
108798 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
108799 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
108800 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
108801 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
108802 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
108803 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
108804 that is where it started to go bad were playing good so hopefully that is where it starts to go great
108805 were back to the way we need to be playing
108806 getting hits making plays making pitches and winning when we lost we were playing bad so the losses felt heavy we seem to be more focused on the next game when the game is over win or lose its about trying to go out and win that next game i think that has a lot to do with attitude
108807 i just think it was probably one of those things where he had that talk because of how we were playing
108808 i think slumps only last so long so i think everybody pulled out of it so if you want to say it was due to the talk or if you want to say it was due to the prolonged slumps coming to an end either way
108809 you definitely can have too many meetings but i felt like at that time it was needed of course we come out and go 5 1 thats good if we go 10 1 and lose a couple believe me ill have another meeting i dont know if that has anything to do with it or not
108810 breakthrough in beauty represents a new more personal era in beauty retailing
108811 by continually searching for and accepting only the very best in undiscovered concepts incubating them and providing them with growth opportunities and guidance we enable innovators to thrive their products become irreplaceable and more importantly accessible in womens lives
108812 the asking price for us was pretty steep so i suspect thats the reason those people didnt move
108813 i think at some point we had a good feeling about it
108814 we can go fight it out with those other two teams
108815 if one of those teams had made a big deal it could definitely have made them the strongest team i think all three of us will be pretty even
108816 im not afraid to pitch happ out of the bullpen
108817 but like i said wednesday i look at happ as a starter
108818 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
108819 the role hes in at the moment is sort of unfair to him
108820 we possibly are going to look at making an adjustment
108821 im not afraid to pitch happ out of the bullpen
108822 well see you never know when hes going to get into a game we could put him in a game early and let him go like the other day when eaton came in if a guy gets knocked out in the second or third inning he could pitch four or five innings getting him work is the big thing keeping him sharp
108823 hes a much better defensive player than i remember seeing he gets a big hit for you every now and then
108824 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
108825 i said were not looking for that guy from seattle
108826 what were looking for is for you to use your instincts
108827 the losses to the mets might have shaken us up a little bit
108828 weve got veterans in here and nobody likes to lose especially the mets but i still think we were just kind of in a lull offensively there for awhile
108829 definitely after the first two games we wanted to come here and get a sweep it was huge for us to win tonight it was a big win
108830 six and two third innings 110 pitches he did ok
108831 we got agreement from one club and they were trying to get agreement on players from the other club
108832 we were involved we couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be
108833 its just that weve got to please our club a little bit we think we know what the value of those players are not only the players on one side of the fence but on our side of the fence you have to really evaluate that and we just thought maybe that was a little too rich of an ask for us
108834 i think the pitching is always a concern if our position players perform as we anticipate or have performed in the past offensively and defensively we should have no problem weve got to be more consistent from a pitching standpoint and an offensive standpoint just to maintain some sort of consistency

108896 one of my colleagues pulled out her majestys chair so she could sit down
108897 league of democracies that can harness the great power of the more than 100 democratic nations around the world to advance our values and defend our shared interests
108898 the best way to secure long term peace and security is to establish a stable prosperous and democratic state in iraq that poses no threat to its neighbors and contributes to the defeat of terrorists
108899 one contains ones adversaries rather than forcing regime change through military intervention
108900 ive always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability that assessment has not changed
108901 my goal is to no longer have u s troops engaged in combat operations in iraq
108902 now poses the greatest strategic challenge to the united states in the region in a generation
108903 the energy crisis has not yet overwhelmed us but it will if we do not act quickly
108904 we could endanger our freedom as a sovereign nation to act in foreign affairs
108905 those who use the n word must be accountable regardless of race
108906 sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me
108907 i have a weak heart i know because i still love you after all these years i love you like i did when i was sixteen and seventeen and eighteen and twenty and twenty five and if you asked me to be yours today i wouldnt hesitate for a moment in saying yes im here to get this off of my chest because im getting married and im here to invite you to the wedding the wedding that i always expected to be ours but things dont always work out the way i plan them i know it would be awkward for you but i was hoping that you would at least come to the reception if only to dance with me just once while i am in a wedding gown
108908 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
108909 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
108910 smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science it is not medicine and it is not safe
108911 legalization of marijuana no matter how it begins will come at the expense of our children and public safety it will create dependency and treatment issues and open the door to use of other drugs impaired health delinquent behavior and drugged drivers
108912 a phony war on drugs that is filling up our prisons especially with people of color
108913 is one of the most destructive criminal justice policies in america today
108914 i smoke cigars i dont think other people should do that if young people ask me i would advise them not to do it
108915 now you are off to see the world with out me by your side funny a couple years ago you asked me to be your bride i dont need to hear
108916 but the way ill probably do it is repost my better authored stuff under full title but all the rest will get lumped together
108917 no matter how long and confusing the list of symptoms a person has i am sure to find only two things wrong they have in them pollutants and or parasites
108918 its quite a good thing youre such a badass sir otherwise youd be dead
108919 how come your the strongest man in the world and you have millions of scars and bruises
108920 nah i gotta clean my room and write a book report
108921 nah ive got a board meeting then a drug deal to stop
108922 because of the novelty of going over there they were fine with it
108923 the one thing were really excited about doing is that fans will have the opportunity to actually sit in the seats they sat in that they held when they had season tickets at the spectrum we worked really hard on it but weve been able to put it together so it should be a lot of fun
108924 this will be a wonderful opportunity for thousands of our fans who used to attend our games at the spectrum or watch them on tv to come back one last time and see the flyers in our old home
108925 will be a wonderful opportunity for thousands of our fans who used to attend our games at the spectrum or watch them on tv to come back one last time and see the flyers in our old home
108926 itll also be the last chance for others who may have never seen the flyers play at the spectrum it will be a highly emotional game for me personally
108927 the extension of the conservatorship was at the request and suggestion of britneys doctors
108928 theyve indicated shes made great improvement but its a work in progress jamie spears doesnt want the conservatorship to last a day longer than the doctors recommend
108929 mommy i want to run outside and play with you
108930 it is an archetypal type of story of this young individual from a poorer less interesting background
108931 he begins to realize that everything is not what it seems
108932 operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely connected characters
108933 if i wear a mullet people might notice and say yeah thats some terrific choice but it would probably draw too much attention to itself
108934 because theres nothing natural about it with people so close
108935 they just put the camera with me and a girl in the back seat of a limo and had me undress her all in one shot i was trying to be careful with her while pulling off garter belts and everything that was supposed to come off and it was an uncomfortable moment
108936 i had forgotten the reality of the situation i was in the limo driver would obviously have been watching me so i turned and looked off camera left i had all the camera people wondering what i was doing and asked would you mind putting up the shade two months later we went back and shot a limo driver responding to me and it was a big laugh in the movie when i relaxed i realized i could put all these elements in play and thats the truth you relax and you actually sense more
108937 the script may say molly wakes bud up but it doesnt say smack him really hard on the back we were able to trust each other and that was crucial because shes my daughter i have to be able to kiss the top of her head pull her hair pat her bottom do everything that speaks of a relationship thats very familiar
108938 i would finance it myself halfway through disney agreed to distribute it
108939 is bud the enemy just because he drinks beer and is illiterate there are people who work at great jobs and dont vote he says we need giants and thats a very profound word even if it comes from bud
108940 that was just bullying i think its cheap and i think its easy and people who keep hacking them are really missing the point
108941 im a fisherman and a hunter i hunt with a bird dog i skin my animals but i think there should be gun laws ok and then i offend all these people on the right and i believe a woman has the right to choose what happens is you just cant exercise any kind of judgment without alienating groups of people how could i possibly be in one party or the other when its like that my views about things are just mixed
108942 i think its typical of my career do something to see if it can work
108943 its a trend we were seeing many science centers across the country do
108944 weve been getting more and more calls as more and more hollywood films are getting released in the imax format and weve always tried to react to what our audiences are looking for
108945 we know that people come here to see those mission based films the classic travelogue films that are high in science content those films are increasingly expensive to make
108946 helps us keep the legacy alive with these mission films
108947 we had a multimillion dollar bond that we used to pay for that project
108948 people demand to see these movies in the imax format
108949 the quality is higher and its a much more immersive experience
108950 that chain may have the right to prevent a film from showing at least on the opening day
108951 we have continued to have a lot of calls about the dark knight
108952 but the decision here was that we wanted to try and stay with the films that relate to our core audience the films rating didnt match what we were trying to do here
108953 cosa non deve fare un povero gaijin per trovare uno straccio di appartamento in affitto
108954 e un gaijin chissa se riuscira ad esprimersi con segni gutturali
108955 ah buongiorno mi scusi se la importuno a quest ora sono mr pocoto pocoto dell agenzia coiopocomacoio c e un cliente che e interessato all appartamento e stranier ah si certo certo mi scusi se l ho disturbata mi faro risentire piu avanti mi scusi arrivederci

108966 we zijn de eerste in australi maar inmiddels is er ook al interesse uit andere staten
108967 wij herkennen de cijfers absoluut niet en dit is gewoon onzin
108968 de wijze waarop dit is gepresenteerd is gewoon kwalijk want zo haal je wel de goede naam van schiphol door het slijk
108969 niemand valt hier welke luchthaven dan ook aan we hebben een onderzoek gedaan op een plek waar je weet dat mensen gestrest zijn en de laptop kunnen kwijtraken
108970 we hebben onze inschatting gebaseerd op een gewone week in mei of in juni en we geloven dat dat representatief is voor het beeld over een jaar
108971 we hebben de schatting voorzichtig opgesteld om dubbeltellen te voorkomen ik zou eerder willen zeggen dat de telling misschien wel aan de conservatieve kant is
108972 wat we in de vs veel zien is dat de laptop uit de tas moet en dan wordt vergeten of per ongeluk wordt omgewisseld met een notebook van een andere reiziger
108973 ik vindt die andere manier van tellen niet zo zinnig
108974 we halen meerdere malen per dag de verloren bagage op en brengen die op een centraal punt
108975 bij ons wordt dus wel centraal geteld en zijn onze cijfers wel steekhoudend

108982 a big hit on the web one of londons obsessives
108983 this is the perfect storm for our business and we see no signs of it blowing over
108984 overall results were weaker than expected due to one time charges and asset sale write offs in both rescap and gmac auto
108985 we expect weak results in both businesses to continue at least through the end of 2008
108986 the u s economy is really headed down and with it auto sales consumer credit is absolutely dissolved on the mortgage side and it continues to degrade now in auto
108987 we are disappointed that massachusetts filed this action because it ignores the only reason our advisers sold auction rate securities they believed they were good investments for clients willing to trade some liquidity for higher return
108988 the inarguable fact is the number of auctions that had failed in nearly two decades of auction rate securities sales was small in 2007 there were no failed auctions of securities sold to retail clients and in fact none to these clients until late january 2008
108989 that auction markets were not functioning properly and were in fact in significant danger of collapsing
108990 our research reflected the honest belief that ars offered higher returns in exchange for less liquidity and noted that market changes had begun to occur
108991 our principal concern is to make people whole particularly individuals and small businesses who have been completely upended by this
108992 we want merrill lynch to undo the damage they did by selling these things knowingly to people telling them they had liquidity then leaving them stranded when they knew these auction markets were in trouble
108993 he played one time 10 minutes like a center playing against our center and we cant punish this so called mismatch
108994 i think we realized were not just going to blow a team out in the first quarter
108995 we have to stay solid on defense and continue to wear a team down
108996 this was also because of the energy we expend in the first quarter to stay in the game with this so strong team
108997 i prefer this team than this team four years ago
108998 better than the 2006 world championship also great unselfishness great effort on defense much more better than two years at world championship
108999 theres no question that one of the biggest things for us is lebrons leadership
109000 ive accepted a challenge to become a better leader and i havent been afraid to lead these guys
109001 a lot of people can be afraid to walk into an arena and play with kobe bryant and play with jason kidd and play with dwyane wade and play with dwight howard and these guys be afraid to tell them something if theyre wrong or be afraid to lead them
109002 but its kind of like my nature i feel its more important to lead guys who are great than guys who are on my team if you understand what im saying
109003 rates went up 70 percent or so in 2003 2004 i dont think people can say that things are good until rates go back down to at least that level

109010 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
109011 people looked at yesterdays frenzied rally and realized the fundamentals werent there to support it
109012 when you order grounding of planes and people are making significant driving changes in the u s because the price of food and gasoline has doubled thats very bearish for oil prices moving forward

109014 tax rebates have been a very effective way of propping up the economy in the second quarter and less so in the third quarter
109015 to fix the economic growth problems you have to restore liquidity to the system
109016 its not down but its marginally up in the low single digits our debit card spending on the other hand has continued to grow and is very robust
109017 we also do believe that the housing prices and the restrictions in credit for consumers have an impact on consumers utilizing their cards
109018 were going to see slower credit card spending because people are maxed out but just because people cant use credit doesnt mean theyre going to turn to cash
109019 we do believe that we will participate in a much bigger way going forward
109020 das umfeld der automobilindustrie hat sich durch die deutlich steigenden l und rohstoffpreise die schw che des us dollars und die auswirkungen der internationalen finanzkrise sowie die schw chere konjunktur in den usa im zweiten quartal nochmals massiv eingetr bt

109022 das makro konomische umfeld in der automobilindustrie d rfte sich aller voraussicht nach auch im kommenden jahr nicht verbessern
109023 aber das was er getan hat rechtfertigt nach 40 jahren arbeit f r die spd nicht einen parteiausschluss
109024 wir hoffen dass die bundesschiedskommission der spd den auf landesebene beschlossenen parteiausschluss zur cknimmt
109025 da haben parteijuristen nach den statuten einen einzelnen punkt bewertet und nicht die gesamtwertung vorgenommen das halte ich f r falsch
109026 wolfgang clement geh rt genauso zur spd wie andrea nahles und hermann scheer
109027 mit seinem namen und seiner reputation als ehemaliger spd vize und bundesminister hat clement eine woche vor einer landtagswahl dazu aufgerufen nicht die spd zu w hlen
109028 die aufregung um seinen m glichen parteiausschluss schadet eher der spd
109029 die spd tut sich damit berhaupt keinen gefallen weil wolfgang clement f r eine bestimmte politische richtung in der spd steht

109045 the film has a poignancy for that reason but not one that needs to be overstated
109046 if you were there at the time and had to choose between who was going to survive the longest you certainly would have chosen the towers
109047 on a personal level i was able to engage with this story and get over the appalling dimensions of that tragedy
109048 i think it is possible to enjoy those buildings for the duration of the film hopefully without that enjoyment being too infected by an awareness of their destruction
109049 a lot of people were very moved i think because of what the film evoked of new york in a different era
109050 i came out to do a question and answer session introducing philippe who was hiding at the back of the cinema
109051 he came bounding down and sir sean connery who was in the audience led what was essentially a standing ovation
109052 sir sean then got up and said it was one of the three best films he had ever seen
109053 it was one of the best moments of my life and a wonderful moment for all of us
109054 it could be several reasons which are hard to study such as hormone disturbances or inherent genetic defects
109055 what has been unclear is whether this was because of the underlying infertility of the parents or because of the laboratory procedures to manipulate sperm eggs and embryos
109056 this memorial is a fitting tribute honouring the 52 lives lost on 7 july 2005 ensuring that the world will never forget them

109061 unsere prognose zeigt vom heutigen intercity netz bleiben nur die linien hamburg k ln koblenz frankfurt hannover leipzig frankfurt stuttgart salzburg und einige anschlussfahrten
109062 st dte wie emden oldenburg uelzen greifswald gie en marburg weimar jena trier ansbach und aalen werden dann keinen fernverkehrsanschluss mehr haben
109063 es wird schon lange behauptet dass die deutsche bahn ag ihr angebot im schienenfernverkehr stark reduzieren wird seit kurzem ist klar dass es f r den intercity keine neuen fahrzeuge geben wird die deutsche bahn hat eine gro serie von ice triebwagen ausgeschrieben diese werden einen kleinen teil der noch aus der staatsbahnzeit stammenden intercity wagenz ge und die ice der ersten generation abl sen
109064 die reduzierung des fernverkehrsangebots hat allerdings wenig mit dem verkauf von kapitalanteilen der db an investoren zu tun sondern mit den ung nstigen rahmenbedingungen f r eigenwirtschaftlichen schienenverkehr in deutschland
109065 die eigenwirtschaftlichen fernverkehrsz ge anderer unternehmen kann man an den fingern einer hand aufz hlen
109066 intercity z ge nach westerland und oberstdorf wird es bald nicht mehr geben
109067 f r den aufwendigen dieselbetrieb mit lokwechsel wird die db in zehn jahren keine geeigneten fahrzeuge mehr haben zu anderen zielen in den bayerischen alpen in den schwarzwald und an der nordsee und ostseek ste werden voraussichtlich noch am wochenende einzelne ice z ge verkehren mehr aber nicht
109068 die db dementiert st ndig solche absichten aber die intercity wagen sind berwiegend 30 jahre alt und am ende ihrer lebensdauer bereits f r den n chsten fahrplanwechsel gibt es listen aus denen der schleichende r ckzug ersichtlich ist wenn die db fr h morgens und sp t abends einige neue ziele mit fernverkehrsz gen ansteuert dann ist das kosmetik um den wahren trend zu verschleiern
109069 bis jetzt k mpft noch jede region einzeln um ihren fernverkehrsanschluss meist erfolglos oder mit scheinerfolgen
109070 die m glichkeiten ersatz f r den intercity zu schaffen sind vielf ltig aber es wird nur eine g nstigere entwicklung als unsere prognose geben wenn alle von flensburg bis garmisch erkennen dass sie im gleichen boot sitzen und eine gemeinsame strategie brauchen die db denkt mit ihrer fahrzeugbeschaffung bereits f r 27 jahre im voraus es ist daher hohe zeit gegenzusteuern

109158 hay muchas ordenanzas que limitan las distancias y las operadoras siempre han dicho que alejar las antenas es un error que el m vil no funcionar correctamente
109159 esta sentencia echa por tierra algunas ideas algunas ordenanzas hacen imposible emitir y es el estado el que tiene que decidir el fallo aclara la situaci n porque legislar sacando las antenas del municipio no se ajusta a derecho

109199 the verse says though you have not seen him you love him thats what peter wrote to all of gods children long ago
109200 you know why mom because we know what jesus did for us
109201 thats why we love him without knowing what he looks like

109214 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment

109239 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
109240 the link between how much a person snacks while watching tv was directly related to viewing food advertisements specifically when choosing to eat an energy dense snack
109241 the exposure to the advertising seems to stimulate a desire to eat that particular food product also sitting watching tv provides a prime opportunity to snack

109243 a musical showcase featuring col jack moelmann and friends at the mighty wurlitzer theatre pipe organ
109244 one day back in february i looked in the mirror and said jack you have a dream go for it not to argue with myself i have personally rented radio city music hall for an organ program the likes of which has not been done in years if ever
109245 im going there to gratify myself by playing and to show off what the music hall has in the way of an organ
109246 we do not have any record of having rented the music hall directly to an individual in the past however we have no formal policy that would preclude us from doing so and all bookings are addressed on a case by case basis
109247 most rentals at carnegie hall are by professional orchestras and ensembles educational organizations or professional artists
109248 its very infrequent that an amateur would rent the hall particularly the main auditorium
109249 i really dont decide what im going to play until i get there and see whats going to work
109250 depending on the mood im in ive changed songs in the middle of the program
109251 we dont print exactly whats being played we announce it we talk in between the numbers make little jokes otherwise it gets kind of boring watching the back of somebody
109252 i was intrigued by it because i was also interested in electricity and electronics and the organ had a lot of buttons on it so i just went from there and have been doing it ever since as a hobby
109253 there are military people in the neighborhood and i outrank them

109264 when more than 20 years ago a fashion team and i took a gorgeous fledgling model out to crete to photograph puffball skirts on the beach it seemed like a perfectly delightful idea that would surely result in immaculately fresh and sexy photos what could possibly go wrong two words naomi campbell when her stroppiness became instantly apparent in the departure lounge at heathrow our mission couldnt have felt more doomed if a voice from the flight deck had told us we were heading with low fuel and engine failure straight for a mountain range in impenetrable fog retouching photographs wasnt a widespread practice then but by the end of the shoot these pictures badly needed it she was crying in most of them her objections were many and whiny it was too cold the clothes were too short thin pink the wig was rubbish she was right about that the wig was indeed rubbish but after five days of ceaseless tantrumming the fashion team was so sick of her that a bit of wig humiliation in a national glossy seemed like delicious revenge

109283 sixty percent of american households have pets and there are about 400 000 households in jeopardy of foreclosure
109284 some portion go to live with family and take pets with them but some have no safety net so that means some 250 000 to half a million pets are in danger
109285 theyre thinking twice before adopting pets when it costs between 400 and 600 a year to provide adequate care
109286 weve had a large influx of dogs and cats in the past few months because people are losing their homes and they cant afford them or cant take them with them
109287 we took in a pitbull mix a few weeks ago from a new jersey woman who was living in her car
109288 you dont have to worry about your pet being euthanized if youre losing your home because of foreclosure
109289 came like every six weeks before they come every 10 to 12 weeks now
109290 i hope people take away more than that this is just a really fat cat

109316 i think the lease is a bad idea the numbers theyre predicting theyll get from the lease are too high and ive got a major problem with giving one of our major assets to a foreign country maybe our governor better take another look at what hes doing
109317 but as gov rendell has expressed it needs to be determined if leasing the turnpike will produce significantly more funds to finance the needed improvements to our transportation infrastructure and i can only consider the idea of a lease if that is proven to be the case
109318 but they also want more toll roads so theyre dealing with two conflicting priorities
109319 theyre going to do a quick but thorough study of the application
109320 i dont think it can qualify there was no impact study no diversion study im not discouraged after talking to them
109321 the counselor went to look again and didnt see the boy

109324 even though they have tweaked a number of rules for the game there is still a substantial amount of details that are similar
109325 its still a 15 by 15 board and you get seven letters with point value
109326 here they have changed some of the rules but the overall premise is pretty much the same
109327 this is an unfortunate event and not something that we are very pleased about especially as mattel has been pursuing the matter in indian courts for the past few months
109328 we will sincerely hope to bring to our fans brighter news in the days to come
109329 with all these people youve never seen before you just never know when somethings going to go bad
109330 i have nothing but good things to say about the police department and i wish them luck but there arent enough of them to really change things
109331 i dont want to knock it because it might work
109332 but what they really need to do is to give the people of camden more jobs more opportunities so the dealers can make money another way you ask most guys why theyre out there on the corner theyre going to say its for their family
109333 if there were more cops living in camden then they would know who was doing what
109334 the way it is now they waste a lot of time bothering people who may have nothing to do with drugs or anything
109335 we dont have to be a victim and only react when its too late
109336 the mission of peace is of utmost importance we want to bring peace to their home their block and make their community safer because with violence youre locked in
109337 the beach is like a ruins actually a monolithic pile of tossed broken stone and torn earth
109338 its the aftermath of a great battle maybe the greatest battle of all where earth ocean and sky converge the ocean attacking the earth itself ripping and tearing while the weight of the sky presses down along the long line of the horizon
109339 the earth is arrogant holding a secret the ocean relentless in seeking it we humans wander the battlefield for a few hours play with the waves build castles of sand and miss the point

109346 very high unit costs relative to other states in combination with heavy traffic more than offset low accident rates and rural primary pavement condition
109347 the federal highway administration recently recognized njdot for generating the most cost savings on construction design of any state in 2007
109348 njdots days of building the cadillac model of infrastructure improvements are long gone and our focus is on maximizing our resources and making cost effective decisions
109349 meeting those two criteria is a difficult challenge for a state like pennsylvania
109350 we have a big old system that we are working hard on improving that mission takes enormous resources
109351 michelle obama connects to the modern woman she has a real woman look to her but is even bigger and better
109352 she has a sleek style thats not overdone shes beautifully dressed without too much fuss she puts on the dress and goes and its always a good dress
109353 the alaia shows shes a little bit of a fashion insider but its more of her intelligence and independence that shows through
109354 we consider ourselves the electoral college that oversees the popular vote
109355 you have a sense of her as a physical person on the move and on the go not a paper doll cutout
109356 an enormous amount of work an enormous amount of stress no sleep and lots of people ive come to know and love who have given me millions of dollars
109357 we deserve to stay in existence because we are so important to the lives of children
109358 there are so few places in our community for them to be in a safe and nurturing environment
109359 we had had some electrical issues the week before so it wasnt unusual
109360 so you can imagine the accumulation of things you love
109361 i bought one and then the next and the next
109362 i didnt have to rent space and sit there and wait for customers
109363 were both very positive people and were looking forward to it
109364 self serving garbage to get out from under a murder charge
109365 he was an annoying teenager but we dont shoot annoying teenagers in the heart
109366 frankly we wouldnt have a lot of teenagers left if we shot them because they were annoying
109367 who among us would not have thought he had a gun
109368 my client feared for his life theres no doubt about it
109369 how many times do i have to answer that question
109370 i thought it was a gun i was scared and thats what happened
109371 it was the second time i held it and the first time i fired it
109372 this is a tragedy but not for both sides as some would say
109373 hes laying in the bed he made and tykeem law is laying in the ground he put him in
109374 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
109375 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
109376 in recent years we have witnessed the benefit that a web site like wikipedia can have on all knowledge
109377 everybodys two or three paychecks away from being homeless so i have nothing against the shelter
109378 youd have to know corey if you complained that it was monday hed say only four more days until friday he was always always always optimistic in his heart he had a good soul
109379 we dont take kids with big problems like fire setters or sexually aggressive kids
109380 obviously we have to do a better job of letting the neighbors in and letting them know what goes on around here
109381 every patient who comes here you always try to do the best for them but you dont have a crystal ball were always hopeful that what we do can set them on the right path
109382 no amount of processed meat is considered safe to eat
109383 a lot of what we get comes to us from the federal food program and we trust that they do their job make sure everything is healthy and on the up and up
109384 we want to assure citizens that our kids are getting healthy wholesome meals
109385 we care about their food these kids are our responsibility
109386 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
109387 we just want to teach parents and school food services directors about the importance of healthy choices
109388 large amounts of red or processed meat over a long period
109389 there are lots of reasons not to give your children large quantities of processed meats cancer is one but there are better ones like high calories high sodium and high fat
109390 if your child eats hot dogs once in a while i dont think that you need to worry that theyll get cancer
109391 we have stacked up health risks by increasing the volume and the frequency of processed foods
109392 there are alternatives there are schools across the nation that are doing quite well
109393 processed meats appear to have carcinogenic properties or agents that can indeed cause cancer its a real issue
109394 processed meats do play an important role in a balanced diet that includes fruits vegetables grains and dairy products

109398 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
109399 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
109400 this legislation will create a higher education system that is more affordable fairer and easier to navigate for students and families
109401 the greatest threat to higher education isnt underfunding its over regulation
109402 it needs to be done before the kids go back to school this fall
109403 i talk to senator kennedy once a week to give him a report on whos been naughty and whos been nice
109404 given the impact that this order will have on americas intelligence community and this committees responsibility to oversee intelligence activities this cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
109405 we were only shown the document after it was complete and on its way to the president for his signature
109406 weve been in a conversation with congress and the american people about the structure of the intelligence community since the fall of 2004
109407 thanks guys i knew that you wouldnt leave us scrabulous addicts stranded for long
109408 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
109409 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
109410 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
109411 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
109412 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
109413 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
109414 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
109415 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
109416 we wanted to add some depth to the bullpen some experience
109417 its a deal we started talking about last weekend and it came together this morning
109418 the basic pattern is clear this is becoming a w shaped recession
109419 the economys decline got interrupted by the rebate checks but it will go back to declining after people finish spending their checks
109420 the housing correction credit market turmoil and high energy prices remain a considerable drag on the economy
109421 while home price adjustments will continue for some time i believe we can move through the bulk of the correction in months rather than years
109422 it is too early to talk about it bottoming out and rebounding the real danger is of the economy slipping further
109423 if you took trade out and looked at just the domestic economy were in a recession right now
109424 whatever strength there was came from the tax rebates from exports and from strong federal government spending
109425 like this and ive travelled the world and ive never seen anything so surrealistically beautiful
109426 this is what it looks like across from my house in the morning the ocean is my living room
109427 i came here five years ago for a winter and i planned on painting and i couldnt help looking out the window and i couldnt paint
109428 my mother was my first teacher when i was six or seven years old i was watching her paint and i told her i was going to be better than her and i dont know if i am my mom was really talented
109429 at 28 i went to a show and saw the paintings of odd nerdrum and i just gasped they were such beautiful paintings the last time id felt so touched was looking at leonardo da vinci i thought this man is still alive im going to find him
109430 i learned to make my own paint its like cooking sometimes you want paint to be thinner and sometimes you want it to be thicker so you can control it
109431 theres no more interesting story than the bible and ive always loved going into churches and seeing biblical imagery
109432 i took the biblical story and put a question mark about what creation is
109433 i see myself as more that kind of character that doesnt go along with convention
109434 in the 1200s 1300s you always see a snake with a womans head they thought it was lilith who got eve to offer adam the apple
109435 there is nothing you can do that will be more informative as you learn how to paint than to do a self portrait its like scales for a pianist
109436 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future

109441 the athlete who can find a way to get an edge is one up on his competitors

109443 as soon as i see someone come into my office that i think is sick i immediately grab the sanitizer you can shake hands at business meetings and still protect yourself
109444 you could infect the whole office any reasonable person will understand that
109445 it might be of interest to take note of your neighbours hygiene practices so sharing of bacteria and yeast doesnt occur
109446 people do not keep to the disposal rules and the refrigerator is taking in food from many many different households
109447 i do not use hand sanitizers or antibiotics as i believe they weaken your immune system
109448 however im much more careful about office hygiene since my mouse sighting
109449 simon is a very talented person who is extremely important to us however on this occasion we felt it was necessary to seek the termination of his engagement on the sound of music in toronto
109450 and we look forward to congress addressing that in the future
109451 from the very beginning it was clear to us that fda was not sharing important information with state regulators
109452 it was a lot of fun and i have directed shakespeare productions here but this is my first opportunity to be on stage in what ive trained to do since i came to canada 10 years ago
109453 he attained his title after being sold into slavery the sheer fact he could do that in a white world says a lot
109454 i studied shakespeare at dal and reading the part of othello made shakespeare make sense at the time and now is a time politically where it the play makes a lot sense it is definitely a play about attaining power and keeping power theres a lot of racism but its more about power
109455 im a guy trying to do right in his world
109456 he calls himself a villain and he knows hes gone over the line but like we all do when weve gone over the line he thinks he is doing the right thing for the situation
109457 he thinks othello slept with his wife he thinks cassio slept with his wife he wants cassios job because he thinks he deserves it more than cassio and he probably does and hes in love somewhere in the background with othello hes a big mess of psychobabble
109458 hes a passionate man and that passion and his compassion makes him easy to manipulate
109459 where im at the things life has presented me makes him an accessible character
109460 age allows us to delve into the darker sides everyone has
109461 it gets harder as you get older i learned hamlet when i was 23 in a couple of days
109462 it is the equivalent of 10 days of rehearsal time for a regular production which is ludicrously short
109463 it adds to the ambience particularly at the time of day were doing it
109464 when you rehearse indoors it feels like you are over emoting while you are preparing yourself to get into the space but when youre there there are no walls no ceilings but there are birds clouds and wind and you have to be big its like the difference between tv and theatre and a lot of the play takes place outside
109465 once the audience gets into act ii and the lights are pointing up into the trees with bats flying overhead and the clouds go across the moon it feels like you are sitting inside the play when it gets dark its chilling
109466 this summer you can easily incorporate some whimsy into the kitchen with some creative twists on classic egg recipes
109467 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on
109468 what theyve done is taking a step in the right direction but i dont think its a big enough step
109469 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
109470 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 per cent of the problem the rest we can deal with
109471 im just an ordinary man the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with
109472 because of your work senator obama asked hillary to be his keynote speaker at the democratic national convention
109473 regretfully this means that senator hillary clinton is no longer under consideration as senator obamas running mate
109474 all indications we have from people close to senator clinton and senator obama are that hillary is not on the short list
109475 jai un conseiller invisible je veux assumer ma d fense seul pas seulement pendant ma comparution initiale mais tout au long de mon proc s

109481 the government and all of us should be joyful because this is something that must be defended something that our children and grandchildren will depend on for their livelihood
109482 well only succeed if all the community is aware that we have to preserve our wealth which gives rain and refreshment to our country to ensure the future of our sons
109483 this is such a great promotion by you guys and for the phillies too
109484 i have already had friends call me and tell me they heard my name on the radio asking how they can get involved
109485 right now im not really sure im still in a state of shock i think ill use some of the money to take my parents to a game
109486 he got player of the game i voted for him twice
109487 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
109488 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
109489 the losses to the mets might have shaken us up a little bit
109490 weve got veterans in here and nobody likes to lose especially the mets but i still think we were just kind of in a lull offensively there for awhile
109491 definitely after the first two games we wanted to come here and get a sweep it was huge for us to win tonight it was a big win
109492 six and two third innings 110 pitches he did ok
109493 id be lying if i told you 6 years ago that i would have envisioned 100 000 people on market street and helicopters flying overhead
109494 someones got to stand up and be the conductor and im more than glad to do it
109495 i want to give back to the community like jon bon jovi gives back
109496 this is incredible to me im in a minor state of shock
109497 id be surprised if theres any other city that has won an arena championship and had something like this this is unbelievable
109498 its a good deal for louis it gives him a chance to grow with a team thats building and allows him to stay with the team he came into the nba with
109499 were normally stockpiled at defensive line and we wouldnt be in this type of situation but thats what it is right now and you move on with it
109500 if you have to make a little adjustment like we did this morning its no big deal we still got a lot taught and at the same time the guys will come out and put the pads back on today and be ready to go you even get a little bit more fire out of them than you would have if you banged them today
109501 i remember parts of practice and i remember sitting there getting water thrown on me
109502 once i got to the hospital i was fine it was one of those things where i couldnt tell what my body was doing
109503 the thing about it is your mind is just rambling everywhere you just feel like youre out of breath
109504 but then you really dont want to make anything worse youve got to be smart and let the trainers do their job if you do what they say eventually youll go back out there
109505 im looking real forward to being back in pads make some tackles make some plays
109506 i think people outside view it as a struggle but we look at it as a great opportunity
109507 there have been some voices that havent been heard on our team
109508 i think the big thing this summer is we will have another opportunity of earning their own fame
109509 we needed to change our game we needed new ideas and pia was perfect for us
109510 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
109511 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
109512 there are going to be criticisms entering this tournament but at the same time im just doing what i feel like i want to do and its going to be a lot of fun
109513 the amount of races hes won in all three divisions you pray for a season like that im happy to be close to him im proud hes done it hes worked hard and the result show
109514 its been a while since weve seen anyone in this series have this type of season
109515 dominant is the word i would use even weeks that it looks like they might not win he found a way to get back to victory lane hes just a phenomenal talent
109516 a lot of people wondered what would happen to a young mans confidence whenever hes released from a high profile team
109517 on the race track even though he looks like hes totally out of control most times hes obviously in control
109518 hes able to drive that car with a freer motion than what the other drivers do thats a big key to why hes winning hes able to get the car through the center because hes able to drive it in the corner a little looser its just a feel that he has that no one else does
109519 youve seen the maturity on and off the race track
109520 were seeing a young man who is very comfortable with who he is i dont know that this would have happened a few years ago i dont know that he would have been able to handle all the success that hes having
109521 and its very gratifying as well youve got to stay humble and stay hungry
109522 ultimately every driver wants to be known as the best ever its an awfully hard task to do youve got the king richard petty youve got dale earnhardt and youve got all those guys that have made the sport what it is
109523 the asking price for us was pretty steep so i suspect thats the reason those people didnt move
109524 i think at some point we had a good feeling about it
109525 we can go fight it out with those other two teams
109526 if one of those teams had made a big deal it could definitely have made them the strongest team i think all three of us will be pretty even
109527 im not afraid to pitch happ out of the bullpen
109528 but like i said wednesday i look at happ as a starter
109529 youre dealing with a smart guy there that gives you a little flexibility with what you can do with hank
109530 hes playing very well right now and hes catching the ball real well were seeing him go up and the quarterbacks just put the ball up hes covered they put the ball up and he goes and gets the thing he can about jump out of the house hes got a great vertical jump and hes utilizing that better he looks to me stronger than what hes been in the past and hes got that big body to go with it hes playing very well right now
109531 definitely the sizewise big receiver but there was a lot of talk in the offseason outside the organization about that one go to guy
109532 any position you have that one key player things happen in this league all the time something happens to that one player then what
109533 id much rather have a team full of guys where if kevin curtis needs a blow or reggie brown needs a blow theyre confident that we can go in and make plays
109534 last year i wasnt going up and attacking the ball like i was the year before thats one thing ive tried to come back and do coach reid got on me a couple of times in the offseason about not going up and getting the ball thats what ive been focusing on this camp
109535 like he told me today there was a catch in the red zone hes like thats what you do you use your body
109536 this year ive lost the weight i feel quicker i feel healthier ive just been focusing on the few little things i sort of overlooked last year in camp
109537 we werent very good in the red zone last season
109538 we were very good in many other factors of the game but that red zone was not good that starts with me we always change if somethings wrong were going to fix it and we did that throughout the season and thought we had it clicking there about midseason and then we reverted back and so yes weve done many things there to improve our red zone production
109539 hes a big physical man who does quite a few different things for us and that certainly is one of them
109540 still a little bit away but hes getting closer here
109541 if philadelphia really understood his value to that team they would never even have allowed him to get upset with his contract you take westbrook off that team and nobody would fear them i dont think they truly understand that
109542 youve got to game plan against him youve got to know where he is every play as a defensive end the things that we do change when hes in the football game when youve got a player on your team like that you have to take care of him
109543 he should be one of the highest paid players in the league period im not saying this as a friend of his i dont even know the guy that well im just saying it because its the truth
109544 tiki couldve played a couple more years at a high level i think
109545 its a young mans game though i do know that
109546 i was hoping to get 3 years out of him we ended up getting 5 he kept himself in excellent shape in his entire 15 year career he had just one minor arthroscopy to his knee
109547 he knew when to get down and avoid the big hit he had terrific peripheral vision former raiders coach art shell used to call him horse eyes he could anticipate the hit coming
109548 guys come at him from all angles but hes very good at avoiding the harsh hits
109549 thats because hes smart about the way he runs and because he has great vision also because hes short in stature hes 5 8 he has great body lean and body awareness its really hard for a tackler to get under him
109550 i dont know who you could compare him to in that respect maybe walter payton he never took a lot of big hits either
109551 brian does it almost by going sideways past tacklers he is without question the best athlete ive ever coached its so hard to describe his athleticism but when you see it you know it wow maybe thats the word wow
109552 you always wonder when a guy is going to hit the wall
109553 with older players youre always rolling the dice you always want to try to reward the guys that have been good players good soldiers for you
109554 sometimes guys slowly decline and sometimes its just a free fall you look at the stats to help you but the stats will lie to you sometimes
109555 there are guys that have done it been productive after theyve turned 30
109556 can they continue to do it thats the question im hoping i can
109557 we were involved we just couldnt get where they wanted to be and we couldnt get where we wanted to be so it was just one of those things
109558 we could please other clubs its just the fact that weve got to please ourselves a little bit we think we know what the value of those players are not only the players on one side of the fence but on our side of the fence you have to really evaluate that we just thought that maybe it was just a little bit too rich an ask for us
109559 i think at some point we had a good feeling about it
109560 i think its good for the game all of the attention
109561 hes a cute little fella he doesnt throw that hard and he doesnt have very good stuff i love facing him he doesnt have many out pitches he should be fortunate hes in the big leagues
109562 it can be pretty intoxicating knowing youre going after history out there it can give you a little more adrenaline
109563 people that want to say things like that all im going to say is that in japanese professional baseball they dont use metal bats
109564 i cant see any kind of issue with him in any way he just looks good as he can possibly look its all good with him right now
109565 if big brown finishes the haskell the right way im going to forget about trying to figure the belmont out
109566 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i dont have an idea but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore a whole lot depends on what happens sunday
109567 the breeders cup is definitely on top of the list even though you know this race here is more important than any race for him right now
109568 whatever happened in the belmont i dont feel that its my fault
109569 i dont feel i did anything wrong i know the horse went into the race very very good
109570 hes just not dealing with the same set of cards he had in spring training
109571 this is the team paying me a lot of money and this is where i want to be
109572 i hate to be put in this situation and now i look like a bad guy again
109573 theyve just got to pitch better they should be able to do better
109574 theyre not sandy koufax and don drysdale but theyre not a ball pitchers either
109575 i hate players who make 100 million and feel sorry for themselves when my dad still has to work
109576 because of the novelty of going over there they were fine with it
109577 the one thing were really excited about doing is that fans will have the opportunity to actually sit in the seats they sat in that they held when they had season tickets at the spectrum we worked really hard on it but weve been able to put it together so it should be a lot of fun
109578 this will be a wonderful opportunity for thousands of our fans who used to attend our games at the spectrum or watch them on tv to come back one last time and see the flyers in our old home

109580 sack in the same sequence andy reid noted that demps has shown the same nose for the ball that led the eagles to draft him
109581 hes developing a midrange game and can shoot the ball from the three point line and hes a very strong defensive player
109582 i think he shoots it a little better than gerald at this point
109583 in my 5 years we have 22 alumni who are playing college basketball on scholarship the most notable one is luc richard mbah a moute
109584 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program
109585 i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family
109586 this is probably the most liberal thing ive ever done in my entire life
109587 it was the most comfortable thing ive ever worn in my entire life

109698 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
109699 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
109700 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
109701 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
109702 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
109703 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
109704 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
109705 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
109706 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
109707 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
109708 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
109709 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
109710 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time
109711 by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
109712 it seems that while i can log in to mobileme and view my calendar contacts i continue to not be able to see mail as mail comes up as a completely blank page
109713 the bd300 is another lg industry first and provides consumers with an advanced high def disc player with unparalleled flexibility and networked access for services such as netflix
109714 chinas semiconductor industry now is undergoing a transformation with an increased focus on designing chips for electronic products that are popular in the nation
109715 in the electronics industry china often is seen simply as a low cost manufacturing region
109716 however the rise of the semiconductor design business in china shows that the nations high tech future increasingly will reside in capitalizing on local brainpower to produce innovative products that appeal to the domestic audience
109717 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
109718 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
109719 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
109720 as the pressure increases on traditional media companies its a great opportunity for us
109721 we definitely have a very strong point of view of how to shore up your traditional business but also expand online weve shown success increasing page views and driving traffic
109722 a lot of them are doing the right things and were helping them along that path were helping them with the jump from old media to new media
109723 weve had a canadian media company come and talk to us and say we want to build our web revenue from 20 million to 100 million those are the sort of questions were getting
109724 brought a different level of access that we didnt have before
109725 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
109726 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
109727 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
109728 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
109729 the investment allows us to act on a global basis
109730 in china and india its a lot related to services and software
109731 we have not announced that we are going to be selling an mp3 player
109732 we are looking into the possibility of coming up with different content avenues that can be shared across multiple devices built by dell
109733 that is something unique thats not fully offered in the marketplace right now
109734 this is basically a way to run away from competition youre putting a lot of pressure on your less competitive peers
109735 nokia has always been extremely tactical with its pricing pinpointing sweet spots in different segments of the market and making adjustments to wrongfoot competitors
109736 this campaign has had extraordinary success in engaging children during the last year and the new ads along with the enhancements to the website will continue the momentum
109737 we have good visibility and a strong pipeline coming into the quarter
109738 theres an appetite for security and storage under one roof symantec is benefiting from that dynamic
109739 i think that provides a degree of insulation for us from broad macroeconomic slowdowns
109740 that said we are not immune perhaps a little better insulated than most
109741 that venture investing is not the best use of a corporations capital and that it is inevitable that it will produce sub par returns at best and significant losses at worst
109742 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
109743 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
109744 a full service law firm uniquely positioned to provide strategic intellectual property corporate financing and litigation services
109745 located in the heart of silicon valleys technology and venture capital community
109746 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
109747 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
109748 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
109749 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy
109750 they can switch to vista buy an apple machine or do something completely different
109751 theyve managed to minimize handset share losses even in the face of fairly aggressive competition particularly from the koreans in north america
109752 theyve managed to hang on to more market share than we expected and managed to do it without cutting prices too much
109753 it still has a mountain to climb its product portfolio is still not competitive enough and sustaining its position in the north american market in the second half of 2008 may prove challenging
109754 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
109755 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
109756 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
109757 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
109758 so far the only reason customers have noticed is because it became news
109759 while we are pleased that facetimes intellectual property rights are protected we are concerned about reuters timetable for installing replacement technology in light of its representations to the court as to its ability to provide adequate
109760 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
109761 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
109762 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are
109763 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
109764 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilising the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
109765 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
109766 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked
109767 its having to find out and get the big surprise by an announcement by bocog at a press conference i think they could have done better
109768 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
109769 an evil fake religion that has been banned by the chinese government
109770 we went and nobody stopped us so we just shot
109771 lets wait for the wonderful performances when the games open on aug 8
109772 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
109773 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
109774 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
109775 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
109776 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
109777 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
109778 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
109779 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
109780 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
109781 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
109782 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
109783 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
109784 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
109785 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony
109786 the companys relentless focus on and ability to meet demand within emerging markets helped propel shipment volumes forward
109787 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
109788 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
109789 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
109790 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
109791 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
109792 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
109793 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
109794 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
109795 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
109796 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
109797 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
109798 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
109799 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
109800 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
109801 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
109802 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
109803 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
109804 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
109805 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
109806 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
109807 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
109808 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
109809 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
109810 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
109811 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
109812 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

109818 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
109819 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
109820 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
109821 i really do struggle to see why we make it so easy for people to fly domestically when you have got such a low carbon alternative in rail its something that should be positively promoted
109822 we want to get more inbound and outbound flight rotations at stansted but we would like to get to the position where all trips between london and edinburgh are done by train
109823 i subscribe to the view that you will see people taking more uk holidays
109824 there are an awful lot of smoky old diesel trains out there the lowest carbon alternative is eurostar and you have to recognise that it is mostly powered by nuclear generated electricity
109825 the restaurant terrace was packed someone would have seen or heard
109826 he couldnt just have finished into thin air leaving his notebook
109827 investors reacted negatively to the worse than expected u s gdp gross domestic product data
109828 overall corporate earnings were weak due to rising oil prices and slowing global demand and investors were pessimistic that earnings would remain sluggish later in the year
109829 theres simply going to be not enough business for certain dealerships in certain areas of the country to stay in business and be profitable
109830 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
109831 this thing has gone from being an extremely important event to almost no event
109832 an important part of my compromise with yahoo is that the board in the settlement agreement has agreed that any meaningful transaction including the strategy in dealing with that transaction will be fully discussed with the entire board before any final decision is made
109833 additionally if any committee is formed to negotiate a meaningful transaction carl icahn will be a member of that committee
109834 a few days ago i met with both jerry yang and roy bostock and i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
109835 the board has come under heavy criticism for the way it handled the microsoft deal
109836 okay so everyone knows theres going to be a new board
109837 that venture investing is not the best use of a corporations capital and that it is inevitable that it will produce sub par returns at best and significant losses at worst
109838 the bd300 is another lg industry first and provides consumers with an advanced high def disc player with unparalleled flexibility and networked access for services such as netflix
109839 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time

109844 people want ubiquitous cell service on their wireless phones everywhere they go and that includes their home and offices
109845 the airave makes it even easier to get enhanced coverage no matter where you live or work
109846 intel has demonstrated that the performance of their systems can help facebook scale our infrastructure
109847 intel is excited to engage with facebook as they are a dynamic force in the evolution of the internet
109848 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
109849 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
109850 in todays corporate governance system where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
109851 realizing i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight when little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both camps
109852 this campaign has had extraordinary success in engaging children during the last year and the new ads along with the enhancements to the website will continue the momentum
109853 this is basically a way to run away from competition youre putting a lot of pressure on your less competitive peers

109862 theyll fix it search is an iterative process but what the surge of interest in cuil showed is that theres a huge pent up demand for an alternative to google
109863 dr patterson joined google in 2004 and filed six patent applications
109864 now as an ex googler or xoogler she has focused on some of the weak points in the google approach to search namely privacy and comprehensive indexing
109865 were engineers and we are reading the press for good feedback and critical feedback
109866 if we didnt have improvements to make we wouldnt have a job here
109867 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
109868 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony

109871 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
109872 we want fios to succeed but were going to do what we have to do to protect our jobs and our healthcare
109873 we cant let corporate greed interfere with getting a fair contract
109874 the potential for very short term volatility around specific announcements in the process is predictable but we would be looking to buy verizon on dips rather than attempting to call each up and down tick over the month or so it may take to finally resolve the labor relationship for another period of years
109875 theres a lot of emerging technology that can make a difference
109876 theres a lot of depth this year in areas such as cloud computing virtualization and mobility that didnt exist last year
109877 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
109878 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy
109879 they can switch to vista buy an apple machine or do something completely different
109880 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
109881 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
109882 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
109883 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
109884 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
109885 as the pressure increases on traditional media companies its a great opportunity for us
109886 we definitely have a very strong point of view of how to shore up your traditional business but also expand online weve shown success increasing page views and driving traffic
109887 a lot of them are doing the right things and were helping them along that path were helping them with the jump from old media to new media
109888 weve had a canadian media company come and talk to us and say we want to build our web revenue from 20 million to 100 million those are the sort of questions were getting
109889 brought a different level of access that we didnt have before
109890 we reject it no one has given any evidence to us its just an allegation
109891 ich f hle mich topfit jetzt kribbelt es schon richtig ich bin froh dass es bald losgeht
109892 sie spielen mit einem anderen vorhandbelag der klebrig ist und dem ball eine andere flugkurve gibt
109893 what is going on here the sign says 3 99
109894 under the influence ofhashish those fanatics would madly rush at their enemies andruthlessly massacre every one within their grasp
109895 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
109896 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
109897 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
109898 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
109899 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
109900 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
109901 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
109902 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
109903 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
109904 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
109905 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
109906 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
109907 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
109908 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
109909 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
109910 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
109911 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
109912 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
109913 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
109914 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
109915 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
109916 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
109917 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
109918 that should answer your how full of sh t am i question
109919 you are long time in this profession and have become a victim of pr
109920 the offer to come to st petersburg was now being pushed in earnest
109921 my margaret can fix visa very quickly her son mark is very well connected i wish my son jamie was i will advise if there is a problem as it happens i will need a new a new sheepskin leather for the winter presumably you can point us in the right direction
109922 the hooligans are wrong to contact the player without contacting the club and agent your contacts has correct direction you will have a meeting with director of club and agent in sport business there are certain principles and for me they are undoubtable it is very unprofessional to contact the sportsman who is not free directly
109923 please book your arrival to russia on the 7th first meeting will be in moscow 8th will go to saint petersburg i beleive it is better if you book hotel in moscow from 7th to 11th and if you stay overnight in saint petersburg pavel will help you with booking
109924 also i would like to give you a golden key arshavin is very friendly with bistrov please think about him they have the same agent but he will be much cheaper ive read today that you want bilyaletdinov bistrov is very brave and quick i do not want to recommend it is your job to form a team just share an idea but how many times i have seen arshavin as many times he was with bistrov
109925 worse reputation in front of agent and director of top russian club making and cancelling the offer
109926 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
109927 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
109928 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
109929 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
109930 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
109931 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
109932 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
109933 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
109934 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
109935 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
109936 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
109937 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense

109949 the las vegas name is very powerful and creating the las vegas golf hall of fame reflects the magnitude of what the recognition means to inductees in addition to capturing the vision that the committee has to promote honor and preserve the deep history and exciting future of golf in the las vegas area
109950 and this is the perfect class of diverse inductees to help ring in the new name and continue our worthwhile mission each is very deserving and honored to have been chosen to receive this lifetime achievement award
109951 overall i think we improved the package again it is a very big push from everybody in the team to improve the car all the time
109952 i think we are making good progress and for myself on the last day we made some set up changes and some modifications to try to improve my situation especially improving the pace in the races
109953 i feel that we have made a step forward and we will see how it goes this weekend
109954 in general the qualifying has been strong but in the races i have suffered more so we are trying to focus on that
109955 i think we are making good progress and we will see this weekend if we have made a significant step or not
109956 well first of all i dont think lewis needs any help
109957 i think he has shown himself that he can do the job and that he doesnt need anyone there
109958 the second point is that i am trying to do the maximum for myself and i am not helping any other drivers thats for sure
109959 in the past it has been very clear that at mclaren they have had the policy of equal drivers and both have the same opportunities
109960 i have the same car the same opportunity and i am just working towards improving the pace and the results
109961 the last few races have been a little bit disappointing but the only way to move on is to keep working hard and eventually the results will come
109962 interestingly following this conversation it always arises that i am helping and i am in the support role but i dont see it like that
109963 the minimum not the ideal but the minimum was 18 utility helicopters and about 12 to 18 combat helicopters that can go to do reconnaissance and other things as of today there is no country in the world that has volunteered to give us that capability zero
109964 ich habe acht oder neun schnelle runden gedreht und war gerade wieder auf voller geschwindigkeit als das auto zwischen turn 1 und turn 2 pl tzlich geradeaus fuhr
109965 ich bin nicht mehr dorthin gefahren wo ich hingelenkt hatte ich wei nicht genau was gebrochen ist auf alle f lle hatte ich keine lenkwirkung mehr und donnerte gerade aus in die mauer
109966 theres no concrete offer for diego and i dont think theres going to be one in the next few days
109967 they are asking for an impossible price for a player of his age
109968 and if they cant be professional athletes maybe they can coach or become team managers or pursue another career in sports
109969 its giving underprivileged kids an opportunity to have fun work with other kids learn a sport and learn something positive that they will take with them through the rest of their lives
109970 it goes back to keeping the kids out of trouble
109971 we would just study do our homework and go to school in the morning
109972 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
109973 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
109974 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
109975 das umfeld der automobilindustrie hat sich durch die deutlich steigenden l und rohstoffpreise die schw che des us dollars und die auswirkungen der internationalen finanzkrise sowie die schw chere konjunktur in den usa im zweiten quartal nochmals massiv eingetr bt
109976 in der folge blieben auch die dortigen preise f r gebrauchtwagen und damit die erl se f r fahrzeuge die aus leasing vertr gen zur ckkamen weiter unter druck
109977 das makro konomische umfeld in der automobilindustrie d rfte sich aller voraussicht nach auch im kommenden jahr nicht verbessern
109978 das sind gute zahlen die die profitabilit t des unternehmens unterstreichen
109979 i could never have imagined achieving anything like this when i first came to manchester united
109980 i worked for the best manager of all time sir alex ferguson i played with the best players in the world and in front of the best supporters
109981 i am very proud of what i achieved but very humble as well that i was given the opportunity to do that
109982 maybe these kids have some respect for us because they know us from united
109983 i remember sticking my foot out and the ball going in but everything else is a bit of a blur
109984 it was pure instinct i had never even done it in practice i was not familiar with the feeling when my foot hit the ball so i didnt know it was going in thankfully it did liverpool in the fa cup earlier that season and i got the winner then so while we were surprised to beat bayern it wasnt a shock that we achieved it in the way we did
109985 three years before i came on as a substitute in the fa cup final against millwall honestly thinking it would be my last game for united
109986 i knew i needed another operation and i just felt that would be it
109987 so to win the premier league again one that my eldest son noah was old enough to remember gave me something i will always treasure
109988 i am not surprised at the number of ex alex ferguson players who have gone on to be managers
109989 something about the gaffer rubs off on you he knows his players he signs players he sees a little bit of himself in they have the right personality
109990 but you take little bits but he has seen and done everything and i have tried to learn from the way he never panics
109991 we reject it no one has given any evidence to us its just an allegation
109992 kami akan mengembangkan informasi sekecil apa pun yang diberikan saksi saksi
109993 trop de promotions tue les promotions trop de soldes tue des soldes et quand vous navez pas de pouvoir dachat vous pourriez faire des soldes nuit et jour ouvrir m me le dimanche a ne sert strictement rien
109994 cest une erreur et moi je pars du principe que les soldes ce sont deux v nements par an si on fait des soldes r currentes ce nest plus du tout le c t v nementiel a ne sert strictement rien
109995 si on fait des soldes cest simplement pour r cup rer nos billes comme on dit au casino il faut quand m me avoir une marge b n ficiaire donc cest totalement ridicule
109996 i would wish that the world were a better place where honest and conscientious public servants were not put in impossible situations such as this
109997 the saudi contribution to our domestic and international efforts to combat terrorism
109998 im just guessing but someone must have said to her you better get your act together or else
109999 thats why i had to buy an external hard drive
